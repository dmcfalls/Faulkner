scrap between them, for it was no secret that the

K domestic life of the 0’Briens was a squally one.

Mrs. O’Brien was picked up unconscious. Her
head was badly- cut and she looked so done up that
an ambulanceiwas called. Mr. O’Brien groaned
dismally and declared that he was “kilt entirely.”

Billy, after picking himself up, joined the
crowd below and explained that the woman had
met with her fall through accident.

“She was chasing me because I butted in to save
her step—daughter Millie from being dragged into
her rooms by the hair of the head. I fell, she
tripped over me and pitched down the stairs. As
for Mr. O’Brien, he must have been coming up
when she went down, and he couldn’t get out of
the way. That’s the whole story.”

O’Brien couldn’t get up on his feet. He de-
clared that one of his legs was broken, and this

was found to be so when the ambulance surgeon vi

examined him.

As for his wife, the surgeon declared that one
of her legs was broken too, also one of her arms
and two of her ribs. Both of them were carried
off to the hospital, and Billy’s mother got home
Billy told
her how thetwo had met with their trouble. Mil-
lie was greatly frightened over the accident which

‘had happened to her step-parents, but she soon

had her hands full with the three small 0’Briens,
who set up a big toot as soon as they learned that

their mother had tumbled downstairs.

Mrs. West went in to help her, while Billy,
forgetting about the valuable package under his
pillow and the roll of bills in his pocket, rushed
down to the street to tell those of his friends who
were about the particulars of the affair.

It was two hours before he remembered that
he had left the package unguarded, and he hur-
ried back to his room to make sure it had not been
disturbed. He told his mother about the respon-
sibility that rested on him, showing her the roll
of money, and when they retired for the night

great satisfaction. He reached the office on time
with the money and the package safe in his pos-

, session and waited impatiently for Mr. Benson to

turn up. The broker appeared at half-past nine—
his accustomed time—and Billy followed him into
his oﬂice, .

“I didn’t deliver that package, Mr. Benson,”
began the boy.

.“Why not?” asked the broker sharply.‘
H “Because I didn’t think it right to do so under
the circumstances.”

“Wasn’t Mr. Raymond at his office?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Then why didn’t you give him the package?”

“Because he'wasn’t in a condition to receive it.”

Mr. Benson looked at his messenger in a sur-

" prised way.

“What do you mean by that?”
“He was under the inﬂuence of liquor——so much

“Then you don't believe me?” '

“Well, it sounds a whole lot like a jolly.”

Billy shoved his ﬁngers into, his vest pocket
and pulled out the bill.

“That I s like a $100, doesn’t it?” ’

“It surely does, but it isn’t yours.” 3

“‘I’d like to see anybody else claim it,” replied
Billy, putting it'back in his pocket. “I made
that this morning.” 5

“You did! How?” -

“A gentleman over in.Brooklyn gave it to me
for doing him a big favor.”
_“The dickens you say.

“He considered it such or he wouldn’t have
con hed up that bill. Now what’s your tip?
M be I’ll take a shy at it.”

“Promise you won’t mention it to anyone and
I’ll tell you.”

“I promise.” .

“L. & M. is going to be boomed by a syndicate
of operators who have a raft of money at their
back.” »

“How did you find that out?”

Brooks explained that he had accidentally over-
heard one of the operators talking the thing over-
with his boss.

“My boss is "going to do the buying,» and he’ll
make a good thing out of it, for the order will
amount to thousands of shares. He’s in with the
bunch, -and does business for them right along.
That accounts for the big bank account he’s got,
and the style he puts on. You ought to drop in
and see our oﬂice -some time. It is one of the
swellest suits in Wall Street.”

“Well, I must get on.
I’m out
for the dough every time.” 1 .

“You’ll clear $150 easily enough if you put it
on L. & M. Take my word for it.” _ . .

Billy went on into the Exchange with his mind
full of the chances that L. & M. offered to make
a big haul. He believed that Bob Brooks was a
pretty square lad and wouldn’t give him a
“ghost” story about stocks. He knew that other
messenger boys had mademoney out of lucky
deals in the market, and was anxious to do like-
wise. He had intended to givehis mother the
$100 bill, but if he could make $150 out of it in
two weeks he believed he ought not let the chance
get away frbm him. .

He couldn’t think about anything else for the
rest of the afternoon, and when he got off at
half- ast three he dropped in at the little bank
assau Street, where messengers and other

stock on the list on margin, while, a regular
broker would not accept a marginal order for

_‘ On margin, I suppose,” said the clerk. “It

_“There’s the money,” replied Billy, shoving his
bill through the window. » ~
_ The clerk picked it up, looked at it, and threw
it on his desk. He made out the brief memoran-
dum_ of _the deal on a printed slip and told Billy
to sign _it. Thus Befison’s new boy made his ﬁrst
plunge into the speculative set. When Billy. sa‘W -

pretty much on the run, as the market was brisk
and in consequence business was booming. I ,
Lots of lambs were cavorting around the dis- ‘ ‘
trict, either interested in deals or on the lookout -:
for an opening that promis d easy money. Billy .. -i
tried to keep track of L. &QM., but ,was not very  ..
successful. He had little opportunity to consult.
the oﬂice ticker, as it was always surrounded‘ by
customers. Besides, if the cashier had seen him
looking at the tape he would have suspected he
was interested in the market, and Billy under-' ,
stood that was against the rules. He was Willing I g ‘
to take some chances in order to make $150., ;
_ Everybody in Wall Streetseemed to be looking 
out for No. 1, and Billy didn’t see « why he ’
shouldn’t do as others did. By the time the Ex- ’ «
change closed at three o'clock, Billy was aware-'
that L. & M. had gone up a point that day. ’ ,
“A point isn’t a whole lot,” he soliloquizedy, « .
“but it means about ten plunks to the good for . ,
me. -If it went up onepoint every day for two  -
weeks it would put me more than $100 ahead.”~ -. - 7‘
While eating his dinner in the restaurant that
afternoon he studied the market report with a
good deal of unction, comparing it with ‘the pre-
vious day’s one, and‘ noting that all importani

_ “It seems to be what they call a ‘bull’ market, ‘v

what brings out -the lambs and makes things. g

pretty lively today, for I’ve used up a lot,of shoe"

ought to club in and buy a shoe store so that we,

The next two or three days were repetitions of‘ 
the preceding ones. All stocks that had any life
in them went higher, and at noon Saturday L. 3;,

had bought his shares. He had met Bob Brooks _'

BENSON’S NEW B01 . . 9

 the middle of. the following week, when L. & M.

had reached 92 and was attracting a lot of atten-

tion, it took on a boom and inside of an hour was

selling at par. Billy was sent to the Exchange
' about this time, and he found the ﬂoor in an
‘ ‘uproar over the stock. ,

A big crowd was around the L. & M. pole, and
the ‘traders were acting like lunatics. All of
them wanted to buy some of the stock, but there
wasn't near enough to go around. The competi-
tion kept the price booming, and the boys at the

’blackboard—had their hands full chalking up the
quotations they came so fast. Billy was tickled to
death‘ as he stood at the rail waiting for the

 chance to deliver his note to his boss, who at that

moment was in the thick of the rumpus. Sud-
denly he received a tremendous slap on the back
that almost took the breath out of his body. _He
swung around and saw Bob Brooks grinning like
va‘ young liyena. ‘

“Who says we’re not in it up to our ears, eh?”
he" said to Billy. .

“Nobody said we weren’t; but please don’t be
so enthusiastic again.”

“I was letting off a little of my steam, that’s
all,” replied Brooks. _

“Well, don’t use me as a safety valve. I might

--

‘ blow up and then you'd land outside in the

gutter.”

“Don’t you feel like shouting over L. & M.._?”
, “I can feel good without shouting. How high
do you think it will go?” '

_“Ask me something easy. I'm going to sell out
as soon as I can get a chance to get to the bank.

When Billy Jeft the Exchange L. & M. was
going at 103.

. . “Gee? Whiz! I’m $200 ahead. I must get to the
little bank somehow or I may get “lost in _the

‘ He rushed back to the oﬂice as fast as he could
kite and found there Was a note for him to take
to, the‘Mills Building. That was away down
Broad Street, in the opposite direction from the

 little bank. He was told to hurry, too, so there V
' i was no chance, for him to attend to his own busi- ‘

ness, which he had no right to expect anyway.

erran would take him right past the little bank.
“It will only take me a minute to give in my

office. '-‘fThis is the only chance I'm likely to get
‘before the Exchange closes, and I'll freeze on to
it, bet your life."

behind the last man, hoping that nobody would
delay matters at the window. It took ten minutes
before he got to the window, and then he ordered
his stock sold at the market, which was then
107%. He felt as if a great load had been taken
off his mind as he ran back to the office as fast
as he could. While waiting to be called on again
he ﬁgured up as near-as he could judge what his
proﬁt ought to be. He found he had cleanediup
$250, and was tickled to death.

CHAPTER VI-Billy Surprises His Mother.

Billy was itching to tell his mother that he was
worth $350, which she would consider a small

fortune, but he decided to wait till he could ﬂash,

the money under her nose. She might be inclined
to doubt his word, but the sight of the money
would surely convince her. So he said nothing
on the subject to her that night except to ask her
what she would do with $100 if she had it pre-
sented to her.

“No such luck, Billy!” she replied, “but if I
did get so much I’d put it in the bank against ‘a
rainy day.”

Billy laughed and went next door to call on

Millie Sackett,~who was still runnning the O’Brien
household. He ,-found that Mr. O’Brien had re-
turned witli the aid of a crutch that afternoon.
That individual did not regard Billy with much
favor, as he had learned from his wife, who was
stillf latid up, that he was responsible for their
mis or une. -

“It’s a great-nerve you have to come in here
after hwlzat you’ve done,” said O’Brien in a
grouc y one. \

B_;‘1What do you mean, Mr. O’Brien?” asked

1 y.

“What do Iinean? Didn’t you throw me wife
down stairs and nearly kill the both of us?”

“No, I didn’t throw her down stairs. Do I look
as _if I was able to do such a‘thing‘? Mrs. O’Brien
weighs over 200 pounds. If she’ told you that I
1t1lireQv ltiler, down stairs then she didn’t tell you

ie ru 1. '

Billy explained the cause of the trouble which
led to the angry woman tripping over him and
losing her balance at the head of the stairs.

“Ask' Millie if what I say isn’t so. She saw
what happened.”

The girl corroborated his statement.

O’Brien, however, was difficult to convince.

“Sure~me wife ought to know whether she fell

you intended to kill her,
I’ni bound to believe her.”

“She’ll have a swell time of it trying to prosc-
cute _me,’’ said Bi.lly',;,not at all disturbed by Mr.
0’Brien’s statement of what his wife intended to
do. t‘:If she has me arrested, I’ll show her up in
cour . - _

“Show her up! What do you mean by that?”

“I’ll tell the judge how she treats Millie, and
I’llthave Millie called toprove that my statement
is rue. ’

“You wouldn’t dare do such a thing. She

and as she’s me wife,

when Mrs. O’Brien was discharged "from the hos-
pital she intended to make me sweat for it.”
“Why you didn’t throw her down stairs.”
“Of course I didn’t. It wasn’t my fault that
she tripped over me. I was trying to get out of

_her way.”

' ‘f"Then she can’t do anything to you.” _
“She’s sore enough on me to try, I guess. If

' she hauls me into court, I’ll tell the judge how

she” and Mr. O’Brien treat Millie. At any rate,
I’ll have Millie to testify that I had nothing to
do with her step-mother’s tumble. I suppose the
0’Briens have a legal right to hold on to Millie
and make her work for them, but if it was shown
in court that“ they abused her the way they do, I
guess the judge would take her away from
them.” _ _ '

“I feel sorry for her, poor child, but I don’t see
that we can do anything for her,” replied Mrs.

, West.

" “Maybe not now, but some day maybe we can,”
said Billy, getting up and walking toward the

. door, intending to rejoin his friends downstairs.

 

‘CHAPTER VII——Billy Gets a New Outﬁt.

" ‘Two weeks later Mrs. 0’Brien got out of the

hospital and returned to the tenement. She looked

like a wreck of her former self, being so greatly

‘I reduced in weight that herold’ clothes wouldn’t

come within a mile of ﬁtting her. The doctors
liad»-told her that she had had a narrow squeak
for" her life, and she certainly gave every evi—‘
dence of the fact. At any rate, she wasn’t the
saine woman she‘ was before the accident,‘ and her
spirits were much affected. Billy heard of her
return and looked for trouble, but she took no
steps against him. Millie resigned her. position as

,head‘of the household and started out to look for

work. She got a position in another skirt factory
on_Broadway in a few days,._ and Billy met her
do nstairs‘when she got home from her ﬁrst

V - dé1_s work there.

“Got a job yet, Millie?” he asked.
,‘‘Yes.' I went to work today for Einstein &

 Finkelsh am .’,’

“Glad to hear it. Maybe Mrs. O’Brien will let
you‘ alone for a while.”
_ “She hasn’t scolded me since she got back.”
“That so? You're lucky.”
“She acts differently to what she used to. She

I doesn’t have near as much to say as before. She

{hardly notices me."’

“That suits you, I guess.” ~

“Mr. ’O’Brien doesn’t say much, either. He's
working now, and when he comes home he eats

' _. hissupper; then sits in a corner by the window
 and smokes his pipe and reads the paper, hardly’
speaking a word, even to his wife.”

“Mother remarked that your rooms were very

NEW BOY 11‘-

anything, she appeared to agree with Billy's
remarks. They talked a few minutes longer and
then Millie went upstairs. On the first of July
Mr. Benson's family moved out to their country
house at Nansook, on the north shore of Long
Island. Quite a colony of brokers and men of
means had cottages, villas and mansions at this
place, which was regarded as one of the loveliest
spots within easy riding distance ‘of New York.

. As business was beginning to get dull in Wall, '

Street, Billy had less running around to do,
which suited him ﬁrst rate, with the thermometer
climbing higher every day. Bob Brooks told him
that he would probably get ‘a week’s vacation in
August, as nearly all the messengers got it, but
Billy had his doubts about it, as he had only been
a short time in the office and was therefore hardly
entitled to the favor. The Fourth of July fell on
a Saturday and Mr. Benson was at the oﬁice until
after the Exchange closed on Friday, Just before
he left he called the boy in to his private oﬂice.

“Billy, you’ve been with me a month now, and
I am very well ‘satisﬁed with you. You have
passed the trial stage and you may consider your

position a ﬁxture. I took you on the recom- ‘

mendation of my friend Deering, who afterward
told me that he knew nothing about you, but sent
you to me to oblige your mother, who, he says, is
a very worthy and'industrious woman. I met him

today and he asked me about you. I told him you ’

were proving satisfactory in every way, and he
said he was glad to hear it. Now, Billy, to-
morrow is the Fourth, and it’s a holiday. I
should be glad to have you come down to my
house at Nansook and stay over till Monday
morning. I am going to have some ﬁreworks in
the evening, and you can help set them off. Take
the eight o’clock train in the morning from the
Long Island depot, and I’ll send my gardener to
the station to meet you and show you the way to
the-house. Ride in the smoker and then he won’t
miss you.”

Billy was much surprised at the invitation and
hardly knew what to say. i

“I’m much obliged to you, sir, but I don't think
I look swell enough to go to your place. I live in
a tenement house on C——.— Street, and this is
my best suit.”

“You look all right, Billy, but still a new suit
wouldn’t hurt you. I’ll give you an order on a
furnishing goods store for a ready-made one.
You might as well get a stiaw hat at the same
time and a couple of ties. I owe you something,
anyway, as I made a couple of thousand dollars

Monday through the rapid execution of a message"

I sent by you. I always like to testify my appre-
ciation of services extra well done.”

Thus speaking, the broker dashed off an order
to a well-known furnisher on a note heading and
handed it to Billy.

“Get whatever you want at the store and it will
be all right,” said Benson, “and be sure and come
down in the morning,— for I will look for you.”

He pushed Billy outside, went over and got
some money from his cashier and then left the
ofﬁce. ‘ _

“Gee! An invitation to spend the Fourthwith

the boss!” soliloquized Billy, quite paralyzed shy ‘

the compliment’. “I guess I'm pretty"solid with
him. A At any rate, he told me’ I’ was doing ﬁne.-

._versation, and he spoke so loyally about her,

declaring that she was the ﬁnestmother in the
world, that Daisy began to think somewhat better
of him. Billy behaved himself pretty well at the
lunch table, though it was easy to see that he
Wasn't used to police society. In the presence of
the broker, his wife and eldest daughter he was

more carful what he said, and the good common
school education he had helped him out. He could

talk intelligently on all the topics of the day, and
so got credit for knowing more than he actually
did. Frank and Daisy took him out after lunch
to show him the neighborl-iood, but they were care-
ful not to call on any of heir friends.

There was very little in the ﬁrecracker line
going on in the aristocratic section of ‘Nansook,
and Billy thought the place rather slow. Infact,
if it wasn't for the display of hunting on all sides
he would- have wondered if it really was the
glorious Fourth, so quiet were things.

“If I had a few bombs about me I'd wake this
place up,” he thought. “Seems to me these folks
around here are lacking in proper enthusiasm.”

, Then he remembered that Mr. Benson had men-
tion about some ﬁreworks he was going to have
in the evening, and he guessed the swell people
preferred to celebrate after dark. When they got
back to the house they found some guests from
another cottage sitting on,the veranda with the
broker, and his wife and daughter. Billy wasn’t
introduced to them, however, but that fact didn’t
worry him any. Finding himself alone for a few
minutes he Went off and hunted up the gardener,
whom he found smoking in a chair at the door
of the automobile garage. He got into conversa-
tion with him, and was soon hail-felIow—well-met
with the man. He didn’t see Erank Benson or
Daisy again until dinner time. '

It was the finest meal Billy had ever sat down
to, though it was the ordinary, every-day dinner
with the Bens s. Heenjoyed it hugely and ate
everything tha came his way. It was dark when
the family and their guests adjourned tothe
veranda overlooking the front. lawn. In the
course of half an hour Mr. Benson sent his son
to tell the gardener to bring the'ﬁreworks on
the scene. The sky was already alight with
rockets and other lurid displays, but the greater
part of this exhibition was conﬁned to the village
proper. Only cottagers who had young people
indulged in burnt‘ .powder.

The gardener presently made his appearance
with several opened boxes, and the privilege of
setting off the roman candles, rockets, colored

Uﬁres, and such things, was delegated to Frank

Benson and Billy. The young messenger,p'rob-
ably had the most fun out of it. At any rate he

wassorry when the last of the stock was used up.

Shortly» afterward the family retired for the

‘night and Billy was shown to a small, well-fur-

nished room at the back of the house.

houses that were used by the wealthy summer
residents. .He extended his ramble along the
shore, coming at length to the low line of cliffs
that lay to the eastward of Nansook.

The tide was way out, so that he was able to
walkalong the hard beach at the base of them,
which, unknown to him, was covered at high
water. As he knew that dinner would not be
served till about ﬁve, he took his time. The
Sound was comparatively calm and the hot sun
glistened upon its wavelets. At some little dis-

tance from the shore there were a number of

catboats sailing hither and thither with summer
boarders from the village.
out of New York before and he rather enjoyed
the novelty of his short outing.

The cliffs wound in and out in an irregular
line that trended toward the southeast, and he
soon lost sight of the bathing houses and small
anchored yachts of the rich residents of Nansook.
No one lived on the cliffs, their summits being
covered with trees and scrub bushes, giving the
vicinity a lonesome look. Turning a point, Billy
suddenly came upon a small, sequestered cove.
Following the curve of the beach, he entered the
cove, which was almost land.-locked, and was
somewhat surprised to see- a small, dirty-looking
sloop in the basin, moored by‘a rope to a fallen
tree trunk. Smoke was issuing from the chimney

, that pierced the deck forward.

Walking around a large rock that stood in his
path, he unexpectedly found himself in the pres-
ence .of_two men who were seated on another
rock, smoking and talking. They sprang to their
feet with exclamations on seeing him, for they
had not heard his footsteps on the sand. Billy
recognized one of the men as the burglar of the
night before, and he naturally concluded that the
other chap was one of the men who had been
with him. The third fellow probably was not
far off. In -fact, as he started to retrace his
steps, believing it wasn’t healthy for him to in-
trude any further into the cove, he caught sight
of a head and shoulders rising out of the open
hatch in the forward part of the sloop.

“Hold on there, young fellow!” cried the man
whose face he knew. “What’s your hurry?”

_“I’m in no hurry, but I’ve gone as far as I
want to go,” replied Billy. 0

“What brought you in here?”

“I just walked in, that’s all.”

“Come here.”

“What for?”

. “Because I say so.”

“What do you want?”

“Come here and I’ll tell you.”

“I’m not curious, so I don’t think I’ll come
replied Billy, edging away.

He had the idea that the rascal recognized him

and that there might be something doing if he
Went within the fellow’s reach.
' “I guess you’ll come,” said the burglar, yank-
ing out his revolver and covering the boy so
quickly that Billy didn’t have time to dodge
around the rock.

“You wouldn’t dare shoot me for nothing,” said

,“How long are you going to keep me? I’ve

more_than an hour to ﬁnd my way to the house.”

“Keep it for good luck,” grinned his associate.‘ '’

There was a tramping of feet overhead for

around on the other side of the after bulkheadof

began in the cabin. Billy picked his ‘way 1n_the
dark over to the bulkhead, and, leaning against
it, tried to hear what the men were talking about.
Their words came quite plain to his ear, and he
soon found that there was a good-sized knot-hole
in the p::... ....cn and he put his eye to it. _He saw
the three ‘-men seated at a small table which was
covered with dishes of food. The head burglar,

' whose name appeared to be Birch, was seated at

one end of the _table, while the others ﬂanked
him on either side. _ _. ”
, “We've done pretty well along shore this trip,
said Downey. “We’ve got enough swag aboard
to pull up anchor and sail for the city. I d like
to see the stuff turned into cash and handle my
share of it.” _
“I’m in favor uofvmaking one more haul,” said
Hicks. *“We’d have done that last night if it

' " hadn’t been for that boy. He must have just
got back from the village or some house in the ‘

place, for he hadn’t turned in when I got up

th ' d '.”
t0.«:T}$a'?$a(sma tough fall you had, Birch,” said
“It’s a wonder you didn’t break your
neck.”

"It is a wonder. That plant frame broke mY
"fall and saved me, but I thought I was a goner at
the time,” re.plied Birch. ,

“Are you goin’ to get back at the boy for it?"
ask? Hiflks. h_. ‘H

~ “Hbw are you‘goin’ to serve him out?”

“We’ll leave him on one of them islands near
the entrance to the East River. He’s not likeily
to get taken off for two or three days.”

“He might starve to death before any one
saw him,” said Downey. “That -would be the

I, same as killin’ him, and I ain’t in favor of such
’ athing.” ‘

“You’re too tender- hearted,” scoffed Birch.
“What do we care what becomes of him after we
land him? Just remember what he done us out

The conversation then turned on. the various
jobs they had pulled off along the Long Island

" north shore and how cleverly they had outwitted
-the constables by retiring to their sloop, which

was ' anchored in various out-of-the-way spots
within reaching distance of the houses they ‘had

A‘ ' robbed’. Billy listened to all they said.

of money their plunder would bring them from
the “fence” they patronized. Finally Birch went
on deck a" d the other two carried the dishes out
to the galley forward, which was simply a small’
space partitioned off in the bows of the sloop.
Billy had been working off and on at the line
that bound his ‘wrists together, trying to free
himself, and he ﬁnally succeeded in getting one
hand out of limbo. The other followed as a mat-
ter of course. The next thing he did was to
strike a match and take a look at'his prison.

17 ° 

There was nothing very promising about it._

There seemed to be only one means of ingress.

and egress and that was through the liatchway
overhead, which was closed by its cover.

"‘I’m bottled up here and must stay till they
let me out,” he soliloquized. “I wish I knew of
some way to get the best of them.” ,.

An hour passed away and from the silence Billy
judged the men had gone ashore. He got up
from the box he was sitting on, but in turning
he tripped over some of the rubbish and fell
against the forward bulkh‘ead——the one that div-
ided the hold from. the galley. One of the planks

forming the partition gave way and fell upon the r

stove. That left an opening through which Billy
managed to squeeze himself, though it was a
tight ﬁt. The scuttle through which entrance was

had to the galley was open and the young mes— ‘

senger, who had been sweltered in the hold,
breathed the fresh air eagerly. Then he ventured
to poke his head up and take a look. The three

rascals were stretched out on the sand above high- ,

water mark. Billy noticed that the basin seemed
larger than when he was brought aboard. This
was caused by the inﬂow of the tide, which had
been rising for some time, The sloop was close
in to the rocks at the head of the cove, the tide
having pushed her in that direction. Her mooring
line was slack and curved down into the water.
Billy was sure he could jump on to the rocks, but
that would do him no good, as he would be stuck
there by the water which came up all around
them. He saw that. the burglars were not asleep,
Just resting on their backs. There was no way
of evading them while they had their senses about
them. Billy sat on a box in the galley and con-
sidered the situation. Presently he heard the
voices of the burglars, and was soon aware that
they were coming off to the sloop.

“I hope none of them will look in here, for if
they do the jig will be up with me, and I won't
get another chance to make my escape,” he
thought. The rascals came on board and then
went straight to the cabin.

Billy poked up his head and say that they were
not in sight, and that the boat was tied along-
side. His heart gave _a jump, for here was a
grand opportunity to give his captors the slip.

CHAPTER XI.—Billy Turns the Tables
. Crooks. _

He crawled out on deck intent on taking ad-
vantage of his chance. The boat, however, was
well aft, and he would have to cross a considerable
part of the deck. This would bring him close to
the open scuttle leading into tho. cabin,‘ through

\ v

on the‘

-‘,.

 is . . ' BENSON’S NEW BOY‘

which the men's voices came up. If they heard
steps on deck they would be able to rush up and

catch him before he could untie the boat’s paint- ’
er. However, he had to risk it, and to help"
' matters he removed his shoes.

His stocking feet made no sound on the planks
as he stepped aft, and the men got no hint of
their late prisoner's presence on deck. Reaching
the place where the boat was tied, Billy quickly
unhitched the rope and was about to step in
when a daring idea struck him. He saw that
the open scuttle leading into the cabin had a
cover that worked on hinges, which, when let
down, could be secured by shoving an iron peg
through the hasp attached to the end. By quick
action he could make prisoners of the three ras-
cals in the cabin.

The chance to execute such a brilliant coupe
was too tempting for Billy to let it get by him.
It would be quite a feather in his cap to capture
the three burglars and recover the plunder they
had stolen from the different residences along
the north shore. It was not improbable that he
would be recompensed by the owners of the prop-
erty. Retying the boat’s painter with a slip-knot,
Billy crawled over to the cabin scuttle. Giving
the cover a shove it fell into its place with a
bang that startled the rascalsbelow and brought
them to their feet. A

Before Birchimoved up the short ladder to see
what had caused the cover to shut, Billy had it
fast, and Birch pushed against it in vain. Now
that he had captured the crooks the problem faced

' the boy——what was he to do in order to get them

into the hands of the authorities of the village?
He knew nothing about sailing even the smallest

" boat, therefore it was out of the question for

him to unmoor the sloop, get her out of the cove
and s:.il her around to the village water front.

> To go for assistance, leaving the men shut up in

the cabin, would take time, and while he was
away the rascals might be able to break out.

If the forward bulkhead was so wobbly as to
afford him an avenue of escape from the hold,
the after one was likely to yield- to the united
strength of three desperate men. With this idea
in his mind, Billy ran forward and secured the

~ , galley scuttle, which worked on the same princi-

ple as the cabin one. The hatch over the hold

was held down by a‘ barrel, half full ‘of water, -
/which the,men themselves had placed upon it
‘after putting the boy down there.

While the
burglars were banging away at the cover of the
scuttle, Billy was thinking pretty hard. _

At last a. plan came into his mind. He was not
sure whether he could work it or not,’ but it was
worth trying at any rate. The scheme was to

try and tow the sloop out of the cove and along <

close to the shore to’ the village front by the
aid of the rowboat. The sloop seemed light, for
she had no cargo aboard; but still it was bound

"to take time and the expenditure of a lot of

muscular energy. Besides, if the men managed to
get out while he was doing it the project was
likely to be a failure. However, it seemed. to
be the only solution of the difficulty, and Billy
determined to put it into practice.

- First, however, he pushed the boom of the
mainsail, directly over the cabin hatch and loosen-
ed tlre sheets, or ropes, that supported the ‘ends
of it soithat the boom sagged down until its

A - of

weight rested" on the roof of the scuttle. Now,-' -
if the cabin bulkhead resisted the efforts of the . 7
rascals to break it down they could not possibly
get out. He congratulated himself -that thifigs  “
seemed to be running his way, and stepping into —. ‘
the boat rowed to the rock around which was‘ .
secured the sloop’s mooring rope. Casting itoﬂ’ 7 -
he tied the end to the after seat of the boat, and .
taking his seat on‘ the middle one, got out the‘ 
oars and began to pull the vessel’s head around. 
toward the entrance of the cove.

This gave him no great trouble, but when he
started to pull the sloop out of the basin against
the tide he found that he had his handsfull.
The greatest diﬂiculty-he had to contend with
was to get the craft under headway. Once he . ,
succeeded in doing that her momentum would: _
help things along. Billy pulled and pulled with 3‘
greall eDe1‘gY- The perspiration oozed down his" r
face for the afternoon was hot. But he stuck, .'L
to his _work like a good fellow, spurred on by the
pounding and thumping the burglars were mak-.
ing in their futile efforts to get out of the cabin.:

_ At last he got the sloop moving forward, and r
in a short time towed her clear of the cove and‘
out into the Sound. He turned toward the village,‘ ' “
distant about a mile, and then found ‘that the}, -"9
sloop made“ better way across the tide then“ ’
against it,_ but he soon saw that she wasslowly / -
sweeping in toward the rock base of the c1'iﬁ‘s‘ 
where the beach he had tramped nearly three F»:
hours before was entirely covered by water. To . 
neutralize this he changed his course to a diagonal"
one, and thus pulled the vesel. away from‘ the ,

shore, but it made his trip longer. . . --‘,3.
There wasn’t a cat-boat in sight now, so there ‘
was no chance of getting any assistance. Billy
alternately rested and pulled at the oars, draw-" “
ing nearer and nearer to the village ‘water-front ' ‘
by slow degrees. The crooks had quit their racket,‘ '
having either come to the conclusion that they
were hopelessly imprisoned, or were consulting, 7
about some other plan to help themselvesiout-. 
At last Billv got by the cliﬁs, and the bath houses,’  
wharf, and other evidences of the end of T his . '
laborious job, hove into view. : -. ‘Q,
“I’ll bet I’ve lost several pounds of weight over"  . -3
this thing,” he said to himself. “I.never worked 
so hard in my life before; but it’s worth ‘it, for ‘ ~ - »
the capture of those burglars is sure to create”
something of a sensation in the nei hborhoodii 
And to think I've done it all by mysel —'—one boy’ .
against three big men. This is where I get into  -
the limelight. I wouldn’t be surprised if the.ac«. ‘
count was. printed in the New York papers.
Some of the crowd would see it then, and I’d.be‘ _ ..
cock of the walk in my block. I’m almost that 
now since I got my job in Wall Street. ‘I won-
der what time it is? Must be close to ﬁve. I .-
hope I won't miss my dinner. Maybe they'll keep" ‘
some for me, thinking I've got lost.” _ _
He resumed rowing again. for he never rested‘~ 4}
long at a time lest the sloop lose her headway, 
which would make his work all the harder. The _' 
racket in the cabin was resumed. Billy judged .,
that the burglars were trying to batter down ~ *
the bulkhead between them and the hold. ’ Fear-
ful that they might succeed in getting out, Billy

seen on Broker Hooley’s desk.

. “Looks good, doesn’t it?” he saiﬂ.

“First class. I’m on. We’ll ma e a haul out
of this that we can blow in on our vacation next
month,” said Brooks. “I’ll meet you after busi-
ness hours and we’ll go up to the little bank to-
gether.”

“All right,” said Billy, who then told him about
the trick that Jenkins and Carter had played on
him. “It cost me a dime and a lot of time, but
ﬂmygoing‘ to get square with those fellows. This
is the second piece of funny business they’ve
worked oil’ on me.”

At that moment they reached Exchange Place
and Billy spotted Jenkins and Carter walking
slowly up toward New Street. ‘

“There they are now,” said Billy.

‘“Yes. The big fellow is Jenkins and the other
is Cartier. They VV0l'l( for two brokers in the
Vanderpool Building." .

“You grab Carter and hold him while I have
it out with the other.”

They slipped silently up behind the unsuspect-
ing youths, and before either was aware that
there was trouble in the air they were grabbed
and held fast.

illy slapped him on both cheeks twice and then

tripped him into the gutter.

“I’l1 get square with you for this,” roared Jen-
kins. -

He looked around for something to throw at
Billy. A muddy—looking bundle of paper lay in
the gutter within his reach. "I-Ie_snatched_it up
and threw it in Bi_1ly’s face. Billy caught it and
started after him, intending to wipe his face with
it. Jenkins, however, wasfast enough on his feet
to escape into the Vanderpool Building, and Billy
had to let him go. He was about to toss the pa-

" pers into the street when it struck him that some-

thing was wrapped in the paper. He examined
the bundle and soon saw that thei-e_was some-
thing. To his surprise there_ were ten negotiable
Boston City ﬁve per cent, gilt-edged Bonds. He
shoved the bonds in his pocket and walked back
to the spot where Brooks was holding on to Car-
ter, in spite of the lad’s protests. 9”

«NOW ‘what have you got to say for yourself.

asked Billy, looking at him. -
“Nothin’,” answered Carter sourly. . ,

,“You shoved mevagainst that Italians apple

ten cents into the bargain. Shell out the dime
and I’ll call it s uare.” _
“Ain't got 11 dime,” responded Carter in a

MANY CITIES HUNT KIDNAPING GANG
\V'I'I‘H $700,000 STOLEN DIAMONDS

Police of more than a half dozen cities, with re- i

covery of more than $700,000 of stolen diamonds
as their objective, have joined the Chicago au-
ihorities in a Search for twenty-two men and wo-
?l’1f.‘.l'1_. said to be members of the gang that kid-
raped l‘.‘iorris Reismer, St. Paul, Minn., real es:
iate dealer recently. i ' '

Eight. suspsctshave been arrested. ‘They and
‘she twenty-two at large are said by police to con-
stitute tho inost powerful diamond robbery gang
in the United States. Simultaneously, it is
charged, they carried on kidnaping plots on an
extensive scale.

In possession of those still at large, police ‘say,
is the nearly $700,000 of loot, proceeds of rob-
beries in Chicago, New York, Brooklyn, Phila-
delphia, Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland and other
cities

Reismer according to the story told after his
release was lured to Chicago by a message saying
a friend was intrcuble. Reisiner said he was
taken ‘to an apartment where he was kicked,
beaten and threatened with death and ordered to
raise $75,000. He carried only a check for $5,000.
Evidently despairing of getting the money, the
men released Reismer and he was found last night
in a Loop hotel.

VVAR ON CANCER: CLINICS IN NEW YO\RK
ANI) MANY OTHER CITIES AID FIGHT
ON DISEASE

A Nation-wide campaign of education has been
inaugurated by the American Society ,i:'or the
Control of Cancer. With the co—operation of phy-
sicians and hospitals, provision has been made for
examinations that may reveal the presence of the
disease in time to check it and thereby reduce
the death rate, which is now more than one_ in
ten among the grown population of the United
States. ‘ '

Part of the campaign is the publication of a
series of authoritative bulletins, prepared by the
society, of which the following is one:

As a means of extending the beneﬁts of skilful
diagnosis and treatment to the greatest number
of people, cancer clinics are being established in
large centres of population. The public is quick
to avail itself of these facilities.

The clinics are sometimes brought about in gen-
eral hospitals with the resources in equipment
and personnel which already exist. The Com-

" monwealth of Massachusetts, which is the leader

among the States of the Union in carrying on an
aggressive crusade against cancer, is co-operating
with the medical profession to establish cancer
clinics of this kind in all of its principal cities.

Sometimes clinic. form a part of institutes es-
pecially devoted to cancer.

Among the places‘ where clinics have been no-
tably successful are New York, Boston, Pitts-
burgh, Washington, Atlanta, Detroit, Columbus,
Minneapolis, Denver and St. Louis. , . ‘

Many years ago, before the modern ‘scientiﬁc

L~INCOI:N’S KINDNESS TOLD BY FOE'S '
WIDOW « ' ,
A simple episode revealing the tenderness of-' 
Abraham Lincoln and his friendship for the Con-
federate general, George Pickett, whom he knew
as. a boy in Quincy. 111., is retold in The Illinois‘;
State Register by Thomas Rees, its publisher.  - -
Mr. Rees took his story from a letter written ,:
by General Pickett’s widow to Charles U. Gord0n;.‘~.=
of Greenville, Miss., declining with regret an in—. I”
vitation to attend a Southern States Republican?
League celebration at Lincoln’s last birthday an-,
iiiversary. ,, . I 4 
Describing General Pickett as “one of the 
greatest and bravest generals of the Confeder-si
acy,_’ M1-. Rees declared his widow’s letter, “writs-;
ten in her old age, worthy of the wife and widow!"
of a great general and leader of men.” ' .
The letter, in part, follows: _ ‘-
“The name of Abraham ,Lincoln,.~wherever? it
may occur, recalls a scene from my1 window in‘-*
the old Pickett home ‘at the corner of Sixth and‘
Leigh Streets in ; Richmond on a day in early-5.] ‘
April after the surrender of our armies. A car;
riage passing by my homewas surrounded. by 
guards and.'fol1owed by a retinue of soldiers. " 
After it had passed the cavalcade paused andi.
a man alighted from the carriage and came back-
to our house. Hearing his knock I opened‘ the 
door, with my baby in my arms, and s’aw..a tall, 1
gaunt and sad-faced man, who asked: ‘  ('1'.

“It had been long since my baby had seen"'a.-

reached out his hands to Mr. Lincoln, who took
him in his arms, an expression of almost divine‘
love glorifying his face.” ‘ . \

. AUTUMN, GALES. PLAY HAVOC
~ V WITH‘ LOBSTER POTS _\

The gales that recently lashed the New. Eng,
land coast wrought great havoc with th-rﬁshing
gear, of the lobstermen. Because’ of the ex'<_:ep— _
.tionally warmdays-" October and the early part‘ -
of November,‘ the lobsters had not crawl d loft?” ”‘
into. greaterdepths for warmth as they rlo'}’in-
lateVFall-and 'Winte1', so that most of the ﬁsaer,-: 
men, still had their traps set on thekelp-covered J
rocks near shore. , . ' ,  I

It'is estimated that between 8,0000 and 10,000 ‘. I4‘
pots were smashed and ruined as they were rolled 
and raked over thesharp ledges by the csushing
u,ndertow. Such a loss is more serious today than-
‘it would have been _a- fewyears ago when ﬁshef1‘—.
men, made their traps of sgzruce and hemlock‘—~~c’uif_
from .the nearby forests. They fashioned the’
bows, frames and runners or bottom pieces, knit- ' (‘
(ted and tarred the, heads and slatted the pots ’
with laths. An ‘old-fashionedytrap of this sort
with a head or-opening at each end was valued ,,
at about $1. " . M ' . l 

.Today nearly all t e lobster potsya1'e.turned
