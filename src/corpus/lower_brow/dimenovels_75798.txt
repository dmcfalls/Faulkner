CHAPTER I.-—Introduces Johnny and His Two
Girl Friends. »

‘Why, Johnny Jones, aren't you mean to
startle me so!” exclaimed Mazie Green, as the
said Johnny, a bright—looking broker's messenger,
umped out suddenly from behind one of the
, round pillars at the entrance of a Wall
Street office building, and grabbed the girl by the
arm.

“And you startled me, too, you horrid boy!”
cried Kitty Brown, Miss Green's companion, with
I smile which showed that the shock she alleged
she had sustained was not a serious one.

“Sorry I pounced on you so suddenly, but it's
a way I have sometimes. Where are you bound-
to lunch?" said Johnny.

“Yes. It's half-past twelve,” replied Mazie.

“Then I'll go with you and stand treat to pay
up "for giving you both such a nervous shake-

“How can you go with us?" asked Mazie.
“You're always busy till the Exchange closes.”

\.‘‘Well. I ain't busy just now,” responded John-
n.y.h.as he started up the street with the two

gzr
“Why not? I hear things are just humming
in the Street to-day. Eric has gone to 50, and

half of the brokers are just crazy over it; while r

the lambs are falling over one another-in their
eagerness to buy. Under such circumstances ou
ought to be ﬂying around like a winged er-
en ,” said Maxie. _

“ know it, but, you see, I just had a run-in
with the boss.”

‘With Mr. Judson?” cried Maxie.

‘Who else? He told me that he guessed I was
too smart for his office, and so he————-"

‘Well?’ said Maxie, almost breathlessly.

‘Fired me.”

‘You don't mean it!" cried both girls, in aston-

idnnent.-_ _
‘If I didn‘t mean it I wouldn’t say so."

good chance get by me to make a thousand cases.
You know you never can tell how the market is
likely to go at any moment. and $1,000 is a lot
of mom:-_v——to me. When I got back. old Judson
was as_cranky as an old machine out of order.
Something he had for breakfast disagreed with
him, I guess, or the trend of the market wasn't
to his liking. At an rate, he handed me a call-
down, and demand to know what took me so
long. I knew better than to tell, him I had been
using some of his time on my own account, but it
appears that Hen Parker, ourfunior clerk, wlio
is down on me li e a carlo‘a(l«:f pig-iron, had
been sent out on an errand, an he saw me go
into the little bank. and ﬁgu-i 1 1nd no bugi-
ness there, reported the fact to boss when he
came Ill. ' The result was I '8 ealleddnto the
private room again and had‘ to own up. Then

V “Are you?” said Kitty. “How would Mazie
and I suit you?"
~ ‘ “Firs-t—rate. Want to go in?” .
- “Sure!” laughed Kitty. “Mazie and I were
talking about going in partners on _our tips.
‘- We're always getting hold of good things. In-
stead of giving them away to our friends. as We
have been doing, we thought we'd make use of
them ourselves and make money."_

“Now you’i- talking! Come in with me as spe-
cial partners. =I’ll hire’ a room somewhere, and
hang out a shingle—-Johnny Jones &  You
two will be the Go. How does that strike you?_

“Why, the ideal We couldn't leave‘ our_posi—
tions to go inlwith you, Johnny." said Mazie.

, “Nobody asked you to leave your Jobs. Hang
on to them with both hands and _feet, too. As
special partners, I should not require your pres-
ence at the oﬁice except when you caught on to a
tip. Then you couldlnress the button and I'd do
the rest. You both get off at four. You could
come around after that hour and consult with _the
head of the ﬁrm-—that’s me. Maybe after a tune
we wouldn't keep the brokers guessing, eh.
chuckled Johnny, as he started in to eat.

“But ,we haven't any money to put_in, John-
ny,” said Kitty, quite taken with the idea.

“I haven't, asked you for any. _ You re both
smart and pretty, and that's capital enough,

“That's settled ,then. I'll draw up papers of
partnership. I can buy a printed blank with the
legal phraseology. We’ll all sign it in a day or
two and then the thing will be done. Now, girls,
if you're done, we'll drink success in pure water
to Johnny Jones & Co.”

And they did with great enthusiasm. Then
Johnny paid the three checks and he and his
fair special partners-to-be walked back to Wall
Street, feeling as if they owned the town.

CHAPTER II.—Johnnv Gets Busy.

Johnny spent the rest of the afternoon up to
three o'clock in the reception-room of the little
bank on Nassau street, watching the marker-boy
chalk up the quotations on the big blackboard.
During that time Erie dropped to 48 and closed
at that ﬁgure.

‘‘I got out at the right time," he said to him-
self. “I’ve lost my job by it, but I'm in $1,000.
I'd sooner have the thousand than the job, you
can bet your socks! When Judson gets cooled
down and begins to realize what a 22-carat ﬁne
messenger he's lost, he'll want to hedge. I'll
bet a dollar to a doughnut that he will send for
me to come back. And I'll bet another dollar that
I won't go back. Mr. Judson can't sit on my neck
and then make it up with a little soft solder. I
don't say he had no right to call me down, but he
could have done it in a different way. I've given
him good, honest service for his money, now he
can get somebody else to try and fill my shoes.
I've done with him for good.”

Johnny walked out of the little bank feeling as
independent as a hogh on ice. The first person he
ran against was Henry Parker, who had taken
his place temporarily. Parker tried to avoid
him, but Johnny stopped him.

“I hope you're satisﬁed.” he said.‘

“What do you mean?” asked Parker.

“You reported to Judson that vou saw me go-
ing into the little bank, and I got the sack.
You're a sneak of the first water, and if there

were not so many people on this street I'd dust

your jacket for you!” said Johnny.

“No, you wouldn't!” retorted Parker. “You got
what was coming to you, and I'm glad of it!”

“You haven't got what's coming to you, yet,
but it's coming, and here is a sample of what you
can expect!” said Johnny. slapping the junior
clerk in the face.

» “I'll get square with you for that ,you beast!’
whined the sneak.

“Run along now, or I'll give you something on
the other side of your jaw to straighten it. If
I told you half what I thought of you your ears
would tingle for a month," said Johnny, who then
walked on. , ’

“I'll ﬁx you, Johnny Jones!" shouted Henry
after’ him.

Johnny paid no attention to him. but went
serenely on his way. He stop _ _
ofﬁce building he reached an made inquiries
about rooms. There were none to let. He was
not surprised, for the offices were at a premium
in Wall Street. He made agplication at several
buildings, without ﬁnding w at he wanted.

“Hello, Johnny!” said a messenger

into the first’

but it wouldn't do for a firm, I guess, if they
transacted much business,” was the reply. .

' . ‘A .“'l'his ﬁrm hasn't begun to do any business

" “Then it might suit. _I:t”'s on the sixth ﬂoor.”

"@:~i-iigoamiiookat

' "If'you know what the ﬁrm wants you will be
able to tell whether it will suit or not.”

‘I know what the firm wants. and if it looks all
right I'll hire it."

‘Friends of yours, I suppose?"

‘Rather!’ replied Johnny, starting for the Ad-
dison Building. , -

He hunted up the janitor and inquired about
the room.

“It’s just been vacated by a patent agent,” said
the janitor. ‘Who wants it, and what’s his busi-
ness?” .

‘J. Jones & Co., stocks and bonds."

_ “It wouldn't suit a broker. There is only one
room. and it isn't very big.”

“Pd like to see it. I can tell whether it will
suit or not.’

' The janitor took him up the elevator and
showed him the room.

‘That will suit," said Johnny. “What’s the
, rent?”
He was told.
“I suppose I'll have to see the superintendent?”
said Johnny.

‘He's away for the day. If the place will suit,
tell the parties to call and see him in his oﬂice
any time after half-past nine in the morning."

Johnny nodded and left. When he reached the
ﬂat where he lived with his mother and a sister,
who worked in in Harlem department store. John-
ny said nothing about having lost his job in
Judaon’s oﬂice. He knew his mother wouldn't
like to hear that, and what she didn’t know
wouldn't trouble her. He intended to turn in his
regular wages to her everv week. just as if he
continued to hold his position. and felt satisﬁed
that in the long run he would do a whole lot bet-
ter in his new venture than running errands for
any broker. Next morning he called on a bro-
ker for whom he had done a big favor some time
before. This trader ha‘! promised to return the
favor any time Johnny applied to him.

“Good morning, Mr. Taylor!” said the boy on
being admitted to his sanctum.

‘Hello, Johnny, glad to see you!
What can I do for you?”

‘I want to rent a small oﬂice in the Addison
Building, and I want to use you as my refer-

“Don t you worry about that, Mr. Taylor. I'll

T136 J11 E116 Ye8t¢1’d8Y.  I calculate to do bet-

The broker smiled. . ‘

“I see there is no use arguing the‘ma,et,er with
you. Experience is the best teacher for you, but
it is usually expensive.’

"I believe so, but I hope it won't cost me‘ as
much as some people."

The broker called in‘his stenographer and dic-
tated a letter to suit his young visitor. When it ;
was typewritten and signed. Jc-hn departed
with it in his pocket. He called on the superin- .
tendent of the Addison Building, showed him the -
letter and tcld him he wanted to rent the oﬂice
till the coming‘ May. .

“Well, we don’t rent oﬁices to boys, but as Mr.
Taylcr guarantees you I will make an exception
in your case. Are you ready to pay a month’s

rent down?" /
“I am." p
“All right. I will give you a receipt for it.

;I‘hen vou can come back in an hour and sign the
ease.”

An hour later Johnny took possession of the
office, with the air of one who felt that at last
he was a person of some importance in Wall
Street. He lost no time in having it ﬁtted up
for business, and before he went home he had a
desk. three chairs. a _small safe. a ticker and
other necessary things in the room. while a paint-
er had inscribed on the door the following:

JOHNNY Jonas & Co.,
Stocks and Bonds. _

When he locked up he stood for a minute and
looked at.the sign. _ v .

had subscribed for, and spent some time over

t.
By that time it was ten ‘o'clock, so he locked up
and walked up to the little bank to watch the
quotations there. He might have remained in
his office and read them off the ticker tape, but
he felt lonesome there and preferred to gowhere
there was a crowd. Besides, the blackboard
showed the quotations oif to a better advantage.
At half-past twelve he went to the corner of
Nassau and Wall to wait for the girls to come
«long. They came tripping along in a few min-
utes. '
‘“Hello, girls! how are you feeling this sun-
shiny day?" he said. accosting them.
_ “Well, if it isn’t Johnny!" said Mazie. “Where
2;‘ ’ were you vesterday? We looked to see you but
were disappointed.” '

“I had my hands full ﬁtting up our new office,"
he replied. _

“My gracious! Have you got an oﬂice al-
ready?" Mazie said.Vin some surprise.

“Surest thing you know! You don't think I
went to sleep over that proposition I made you,
do you? Not much! I was on the Job. I'v_e
rented room 641 on the sixth ﬂoor of the Addi-
con Building, and have got it all ﬁtted up. As
soon as you two get of to-day I want you to come

“I must say you haven t lost any time. J ohnny;

cried Mazieabeainingly. ’ _ .

“It doesn't seem real,” replied Kitty.

‘§‘You’ll ﬁnd it real enough when the ﬁrm gets

“You’ve got an awful nerve.

“I’ve forgotten more than you’ll ever learn,
pieface!"

“Don’t you call‘ me pieface, you beast!” cried
Parker, angrily.

If Johnny’s arms hadn’t been loaded he would
have made a dash at "his enemy. Parker doubt-
less counted on that advantage when he applied
the word “beast,” a favorite expression of his, to
the ex-messenger. He heartily hated Johnny, but
was afraid of his prowess.

“Wait till I lay my hands on you, Parker, and
I'll make you walk Spanish!” said Johnny, with
a threatening nod.

“If you touch me I’ll have you arrested, you
loafer!”

Johnny turned his back on him and thrust the
key into the lock of the door.

“Johnny Jones & Co. Oh, what a fake!" said
Parker, in a guying tone. “Get on to the kid
broker! It ought to be Johnny Lobster & Co.”

Johnny went in and shut the door. Parker
slipped up and shouted: “Oh, you fake!” through
the keyhole. Then fearing to take any more
chances, he gave the door a kick and started for
the elevator. When he got back to his oiﬁce he
spread the news that Johnny Jones had
hired an oﬂice in the Addison Building and was
advertising himself as a dealer in stocks and
bonds. The other clerks didn't believe him, for it
struck them as ridiculous.

“Well, go up and see for yourselves. Sixth
floor, room 641. The sign on the door is Johnny
Jones & Co., stocks and bonds,” said Parker.

“The sign may be there, but it doesn't refer to
J lohiény Jones who worked here," said the margin
c er .

“Yes, it does, for I saw him going in there. I
asked him if that was his sign and he said it was.
He must have made a raise somewhere to put up
that bluﬂ’. I guess the Co., whoever that chump
is, has put up the dough," said Parker.

The margin clerk said that when he went to
lunch he'd go and see if Parker had told the
truth. Fifteen minutes later he put on his hat
and left the oﬂice. He patronized a quick-lunch
establishment on Pine street. On his way back
he entered the Addison Building and went up to
the sixth floor. Sure enough. there was the sign
on one of the doors that Parker had referred to.
The margin clerk, whose name was Tom An-
drews, and who was friendly with Johnny, open-
ed the door and walked in. Johnny was at his
desk, reading a Western mining newspaper;

“Why, hello. Johnny!” exclaimed Andrews.
“Have you really gone in business?"

“That's what I have. Take a seat. Andrews."

‘Can't spare the time. Parker told everybody
in the office that you had an ofﬁoe here, but we
didn't believe it. When he insisted that it was
so I decided to investigate when I went to lunch.”

“You're taking your lunch late to-day. aren't
you? It's quarter of four,” replied Johnny’;

“Yes.- I've been too busy to go out fore.

“I’m not worrying, so you needn’t,” smiled
Johnny. _ _

, “Parker has been making all kinds of fun of
you. He says you’ll see your ﬁnish so quick it
will make your head swim.”,, _

“He’s liable to see his ﬁnish before I see mine.
You can't expect anything friendly toward me
from Parker. You know he hates me, though
just what the reason is I’ve never been able to
make out.”

“He doesn't amount to anything in the oﬁice.
Nobody likes him. But tell me, did you get the
bounce for playing the market? That’s what
Parker says.

“Yes. I took a ﬂyer on Erie. When it went
up to 50 I sold out. Parker saw me go into
the little bank on Nassau street, and told Mr.
Judson. That’s the whole thing.”_

“Then you got ﬁred through Parker?”

“Yes.”

“He's a little sneak. I'll tell the fellows, and
they’ll give him the cold shoulder. Well, I must

Fifteen minutes later Mazie Green and Kitty
Brown walked in. They took in the oﬂice with
an approving eye as Johnny placed seats for them
close beside his desk. _

“You've got a nice little oﬂice, Johnny,” said
Maxie. .

"‘You mean we have,” corrected the boy.

“Oh, dear! I can’t get it into my head that
I am really one of the Co.,” lau hed the girl.

“Nor I," interjected Kitty. “%ut we must be 

when Johnny says we are.”

“Well. you aren’t the Co. yet, but ﬂyou will be
as soon as you put your names to e partner-
ship agreement. Here it is. Read it and see If
it suits your _ideas. If not, I will try and make
it suit you," said Johnny.

The‘girls read it in turn and declared that it
suited them all right. According to the docu-
ment the capital of the new ﬁrm was to consist
of the sum of $7,500.

The girls were each to pay in $2,500 out of
the proﬁts of the business, but until that sum

was paid in they were not to share in any’ in-.

dividual deal made by Johnny, unless same was
made on_ the strength of a tip from ~them.

"‘All right," said Johnny, “if it is satisfactory
to you we will all sign it, and the partnership
will be an assured fact.”

CHAPTER IV.—Johnny Saves Two Ladies.

When Johnny got home that afternoon he found
a letter from Mr. Judson awaiting him. The
broker told him he could come back next mom-

ing on condition that he promised to do no more ‘

speculating. Johnny grinned and put the letter
in his pocket. After supper he went downtown
to a big vaudeville show.

He was standing on the northeast corner of
Broadway and 42d street when two ladies-—an
elderly one and one about thirty-ﬁve—-came along
and started to cross over to the Times Building.

A taxicab swung around the corner at the mo-
ment and would have run the two ladies down
only that Johnny sprang forward, grabbed them.

They were both terribly frightened, and stood

“Say, Johnny, is this you?” he roared out, fol-

CHATTER V.—Johnny Jones 6: Co.’s First Cus-
tomer.

He returned to the oﬁice about half-past one
and found that somebody had been taking liber-
ties with his sign. A piece of paper with the
word “Lobster” printed on it was pasted over
“Jones.” Johnny was as mad as a hornet.

“That’s Henry Parker's work,” he muttered,
angrily, tearing it off. “I’ll fix that chap.” _

The reverse side of the sheet bore the imprint
of Hiram Judson, and that seemed proof positive
of Parker's. guilt. Johnny marched right down
to Judson’s office and entered. Parker was com-
ing out of the boss’ room with some papers in his
grand. He didn't see Johnny till the lad grabbed

im.

“Do you see that paper with the word lobster
on it?” cried Johnny. “What did you paste that
over my name on my office door for?"

‘I don’t know nothing]. about it,"
Parker, trying to release iniself.

“I suppose you didn’t do it?”

“No, I didn't." _

,“There’s nroof that you did,” and Johnny
turned the paper over and showed him Judson s
imprint on the back of it. “See that? That
paper came from this office, and you’re the only
one who would be guilty of such a contemptible
act. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. I’ve
a great mind to give you a whaling right here.

“Good afternoon, Mr. Judson!" said the ex-

Judson looked at the boy quite hard.‘ _ _

“I've got more than that. You don’t suppose
I could go into the brokerage business on hot air,
do you?’

‘Huh!’ said Judson, picking up Johnny's busi-
nem card and looking at it again. ‘You have
two partners, I see. Who are these people?”

‘Two very nice persons, indeed, I assure you,"
replied the boy.

Huh!’ said the broker again. “I suppose they
are putting up the money. I feel sorry for them."
‘ “I don’t think they require any sympathy, Mr.
Judson. How about my oﬂ'er'."’ '

“l’lI let you have the stock for $2,000 cash.”

“I'll split the difference and give you $1,900."

“Where is your money?”

‘Do you accept my offer?”

‘Ya’!

‘Hake your memorandum and I’ll give you an
order on the Wall Street National Bank for the
money, payable on delivery of the certiﬁcates.”

‘Huh. Your ﬁrm banks there, eh? Why didn’t
you have a certiﬁed check?”

‘How did I know you had so much of the stock?‘

‘Wait a moment," said Judson.

He got into communication with the bank in

establishment was prepared to honor an order

satisﬁed and put the deal through. Incidentally,
he began to entertain a new opinion of Johnny.

‘Well, I'm sorry you're not coming back,” he
aaid. “You were a good messenger."

‘If you hadn't discharged me in such a rough
gay you'd had me back, probably,” answered

spectacular show with lots of pretty girls, and
Marshall was well pleased with it. After it was
out. Johnny put him aboard a Broadway car and
told the conductor to set him down at the Astor
House. Then the young broker went home and
told his mother and sister, who had not gone to
bed, what a bang-uo time he had had with the
man from the West. Next morning he bought
250 shares of A. & C. at 88, on margin, at the
little bank. and then he started out to visit the
other brokers on the list. who had Red Gnome
mining stock. He got some for nine cents. but
the bulk of it cost him ten cents. One broker
held out for fifteen, until Johnny got up to go.
when he came down to twelve, and ﬁnally agreed
to take ten. The last man on the list was his
friend Taylor, and he walked into his oﬂioe at
three o'clock.

“Hello. Johnny, how are you coming on?" asked
the trader.

“Fine as silk. There's my card."

“Johnny Jones & Co.. Stocks and Bonds," read
Taylor. “You're going some, young man.
the Co.‘."'

“That's one of my business secrets. Their
names are on the card." ‘

“ . Green, K. Brown," said Taylor. “Never
heard of them. A couple of boys. like yourself?‘

“No, they're not boys. I'll introduce you to
them some time. Now, I came in to see if you
have any Red Gnome mining shares. I'd like to
get about 5,000 at ten cents.”

“You came to the right shop, for I've got ﬁfty
100-share certiﬁcates. What do you want with
that stock? I'll be glad to let you have the shares
at ten cents, though they cost me twenty-ﬁve a
year ago, but I warn you that they don't amount
to a whole lot.”

“I'm buying them for a customer."

“What! Got a customer already?" laughed
Taylor.
“Why not? Do you think the men brokers of

Wall Street have a mortgage on all the lambs?”

“If they haven't it isn't their fault!" chuckled
the broker. _

“Well, how about those shares? Make out your
memorandum. Here is my order for your money,
which you will get on delivery of the certiﬁcates
at the Wall Street National.”

“All right, Johnny. I'll send them around
there."

Johnny took his leave, having ﬁlled his entire
order, he believed, with satisfaction to his cus-
tomer. When he reached his oﬂioe he found
Marshall cooling his heels in the corridor.

“Sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr. Marshall,
but I was jut ﬁnishing up your order."

“Have you secured all the stock?”

“Every share.”

“You're a lolla lluserl" said the Westerner,
clapping him on e back. “I will pay you your
commission now.” -

Johnny spread out the memorandum of, sale he
had received from the diﬁerent brokers as evi-
dence that he had fulﬁlled his contract.

“You will find the 100,000 shares at the bulk,
with a small balance still in your favor, as.
see I bought 35,000 shares at a lower ﬁgure an
ten cents,” said Johnny.

“There are no dies on you, sonny; said Mary, ,

“No, sir, I haven’t the least idea.”

Pm goin ’to leave with you for you to sell later
on when you get orders from me to do so. You
will be furnished with a stock book in which to
make the transfers of ownership, and enough
blank certiﬁcates to do business with. How does
that suit you, sonny?” -

"First-rate." '

‘Further, I shall recommend Johnny Jones &

; Co. to other mining companies wanting an East-
ern transfer oﬁice. Your ﬁrm is likely to repre-
sent quite a number of Western mining inter-
ests. Not only that, but new propositions out
West will be apt, on my recommendation, to em-
ploy you to act as promoters in Wall Street for
them. You will ﬁnd there is good money in it.
Still further, I will recommend our ﬁrm as East-
ern correspondent to such Goldﬁeld and other
Nevada brokers as are not already provided with
representatives here in Wall Street. That will
keep you right in touch with the Western mining
industry. You will soon need a suite of offices,
sonny, and Johnny Jones & Co. will become 9.
recognized Wall Street institution.”

“Mr. Marshall, I am bound to say that you are
acting very generously toward us."

‘Us! Well, I haven't met your partners yet, so
_I am doing this for you.”

‘You shall meet them, sir, in a short time.
'Iiey'll both be here in about ﬁfteen minutes,
and if they don’t take you by storm I shall be
much surprised." _

. ‘Waal, I'll be glad to meet your pards, sonny.
If they’re anythin' like you I won't have no fault
to ﬁnd with them,” said Marshall.

“Oh, they're a whole lot diﬂerent from me,”
chuckled Johnny.

The man from the West began talking about

. the Red Gnome mine, which he said would short-
ly develop into a winner.

“We don't expect to sell much of the stock
under a dollar,” he said. “When we begin turn-
in’ out ore that assays over $300 to the ton, the
people who sold out their stock to us are goin’ to
feel kind of sore. I reckon the price will go to
two dollars inside of six months, and we’ll be
payin’ dividends." ;

v Just then the door opened and in walked Mazie
and Kitty. They stopped on seeing the Wester-
ner, and seemed about to withdraw, when Johnny
jumped up and said:

‘Come in, girls. Let me make you acquainted
with Mr. Hen Marshall, of Paradise, Nevada.
Hr. Marshall, this is Kiss Green, and this is
lies Brawn. They are my partners. You know
behold the entire ﬁrm of Johnny Jones & Co."

‘Gosh! You don’t mean it!" gasped the wild
and woolly gent, who was somewhat dazzled by
the good looks of the Co.

He pulled of his big soft hat, got on his feet
and bowed in an embarrassed way that showed he
was not over-accustomed to the society of young

“If it goes that high, and I sell at the right

 go a long ‘way toward paying up your capital."
7* ‘The conference lasted till ﬁve o'clock, and then

Johnny saw his partners to the Hanover Square
V elevated station. Next morning, just as Johnny
was preparing to go up to the little bank, after
noticmg, by the ticker, that A. & C. had opened
at 89, Hen Marshall walked in.
“Here is the Red Gnome minin' shares, sonny.
Give me an ‘itemized receipt for the certiﬁcates
and then lock them up in vour safe till you hear
..  from me. I’m goin’ VVest at two o'clock this af-

‘~"~ “So soon? I’m sorry to part with you, Mr.

“I’m sorry that I won't be able to see ore of

around yesterday. Give my best regards to the
young ladies-——your pards——and tell them I shall
look forward to»the pleasure of meetin’ them the
next time I come to New York."

* “I'll do so. I might as well tell you that you
made a big hit with them. and they think you're

awfully good to take so much interest in our-
ﬁrm."

The Westerner laughed. and said that it would
be a great pleasure for him to give Johnny Jones
k Co. a boost. .

“You'people deserve it, and it won't cost me
nothin' more than a little breath," he said. “Be-
sides, our mine needs just such a ﬁrm to repre-
sent it in Wall Street." '

After some further talk, Marshall took his
leave, ‘saying that he wouldn't see Johnny again
till his next visit to the city, whenever that would
happen. Instead of going to the little bank, as he
had intended,’Johnny stopped in at Broker Tay-

. , lor’s, got a card of admission to the Stock Ex-
t.» .» , ch . gallery, and spent the morning there. He
. pkep his eye on,the A. & C. standard and noticed

12  V JOHNNY JONES & co.

“That’s right,” nodded Johnny. “Anything new
in our line?”

The girls had nothing of importance to com-
municate, and so the conversation drifted oil’ into
mere personal, talk. A week passed. during which
A. & C. went slowly up to 92, and then the bro-
kers began to take notice of the stock. and con-
siderable business was done in it. This led to
sharp ﬂuctuation in the price. the traders buying
and selling again on small advances. Two weeks
from the time Johnnv got the tip from Mazie the
stock began to boom and then there was some-
thing doing in the Exchange. He was in the
Exchange gallery, watching the excitement on
the ﬂoor till the price went above par. then he
went to the little bank and noted the quotations
as they were put upon the blackboard. At half-
past two A. & C. was going at 110, and Johnny
decided he would take no more chances with it.
Accordingly, he sold out, and ﬁgured up his proﬁt
at $5,500.

A third of this or $1,833, would go to his pri-
vate account, while the balance, or $3,667, would
go toward the ﬁr-m’s capital, as part of the $5,-
000 which the girls had to contribute to match
his investment of $2,500. When they came in
that afternoon, Johnny reported that he had
closed out the A. & C. deal at a proﬁt that cov-
ered two-thirds of the capital they had to put in.

“You girls only need $1,333 more to make good.
You _have now each a little over $1,800 in the
business, which, with my investment. gives us a
woaking capital of $6,000, with $167 over," he
sai .

“Are we really worth $1,800?" said Mazie.

“Every cent of it, each of you,” replied John-
ny. “How does it feel to be worth a little
money?"

“My goodness!" cried Kitty. “And Mazie’s tip
did that?"

Johnny nodded. He explained that he had de-
ducted his share of the proﬁts. which made him
individually worth $2,200 outside of the ﬁrm.

“When I have drawn the amount of my cash
investment of $2,500 we will then all three be on
the same footing—the proﬁts of the business will
have furnished our whole capital, and you girls
will be under no further obligations to me ex-
cept for the fact that we couldn’t have started
out but for the backing my little capital gave
us,” he said.

‘I think you ought to get more than the $2-
500 you put in to compensate you for the risk
you ran." said Kitty.

“No, I went in with the understanding that I
was to take all the risk in order to give u girls
the chance to make good your part of
capital. One more successful deal and then
Johnny Jones & Co. will be on its feet. Although
our articles of. co artnership state that our capi-
tal shall be 37,60 , it will be better for the ﬁnan-
cial stability of the ﬁrm if we let our capital ac-
cumulate. We will need it as soon as we begin
to do regular business outside our-_ speculations.
Understands, girls?”

They understood, and told him that whatever
he suggested went with them.

“You arerunning the buiness, Johnny.’ said
Maxie.

“All right, girls; I'm glad you have perfect
conﬁdence in me.”
_ “Why shouldn't we? We wouldn't be worth a
cent of this money you have made for us if you
hadn’t taken us in with you,” said Kitty. “You
are the finest boy in the world."
. “Thanks. You have said that once or twice be-
fore,” laughed Johnny. “And you both know 1'

think you are the finest girls in or out of Wall _

Street.”
“We seem to be throwing bouquets at each
other this afternoon," laughed Mazie.
“Then we’d better quit,” said Johnny. “Al-

— though I have not collected our money yet, I’ve

made memorandum entries to be written into our
books as soon as I have compared them with the
little bank’s statement of“ account. There will
probably be a small difference between the bank's
ﬁgures and my own, but in the main you know
just about how we stand at this moment."
The meeting of the ﬁrm then adjourned.

CHAPTER IX.—Johnny and Broker Fink.

Dick Smith, after his interview with Johnny at
his oﬂice, spread the news among the messengers
that Johnny Jones was really in business in the
Addison Building, and that he dealt in stocks and
bonds, like any broker. The boys were aston-
ished, and a score of them in turn visited the
sixth ﬂoor of the Addison Building, saw the sign,
‘Johnny Jones & Co.” on the door, and tried to
get in, but it happened Johnny was always away
when one of them called. As Johnny wasn’t on
the street much during the two weeks the ﬁrm
had been in existence, he didn’t run across any
of his old friends. Now that he'had closed up
the A. & C. deal, and had nothing on his hands
of importance, he was in his oﬂice oftener than
previously.

Henry Parker had ‘taken the hint and let him
alone, for he knew that he might expect it if he
went too far. Besides, Parker didn’t go out on
errands any more, as Broker Judson had hired a
regular messenger to fill Johnny’s shoes. A num-
ber of the tenants of the sixth ﬂoor had noticed
the sign of the new occupants of room 641 and
wondered who the ﬁrm was. Johnny Jones was
not a familiar name to any of them, and they
ﬁgured that he, at least, must be a stranger from
some other city. A Curb trader, named Fink, had

seen Johnny in and out of the allies a couple
of times, loc ' or unlockin the door, as the
case might be. e had seen no dy else connected

with the omce, and several times when he tried
the door, on curiosity, he to rid it locked. At

on the afternoon follo ing the close of
Johnny's deal, Broker Fink tried his door for

CHAPTER X.—-Johnny Jones & Co. Begin to Get
Real Busy.

Johnny was sitting in his olﬁce after his re-
turn fr-an lunch, a few days later, when a dis-
trict telegraph messenger brought him a note
from Kitty. The young lady had learned that
two rival railroads, which had been trying to do
one another on the freioht and passenger busi-
ness, and thereby had been carrying on business
at a loss for a year past, had patched up their
differences and practically consolidated their in-
terests. This mutual agreement was to be an-
nounced as soon as the companies had ﬁxed up a
new freight rate, and were ready to resume their
ﬁrzgﬁlar passenger schedule in effect before the

The stock of both roads, which had fallen with
the stoppage of dividends, and the possibility
that they might get into the hands of receivers,
was sure to jump up as soon as the news got out,
which would happen in a few days. Kitty ad-
vised Johnny to buy all the shares he could on
margin of the D. & J., one of the two roads, as
she believed there would be a proﬁt of $10 a
share in the deal. Johnny knew that Kitty was
in a position to get the information she had sent
him, and he also knew that she would not advise
him to buy unless she had good reason to believe
that the deal would be a winner. He ,therefore,
felt no hesitation in following her pointer. He
went to the little bank and bought 600 shares of
D. & J., at the market price, which was 72. It
took $6,000, nearly every cent of the ﬁrm’s capi-
hl at present, to cover the marginal deposit, 
Johnny put it up like a little major. The girls
tamed up at their usual time, and Johnny re-
w at he had done.

“We'll win!” said Kitty, conﬁdently. _

_ ‘A lady who lives up-State. She saw our ad-
vertisement in the Wall Street News and sent
as 81,000 to buy her 100 shares of B. & 0. on
margin. I've placed the order with Broker
Simms, and he’s going to divide the commission
with us. He wanted to put the deal-through for
nothing, as he feels under obligation to me for
saving his wife and mother-in-law from bein
run over—you remember the incident, but

‘wouldn't have it. I've arranged with him to al-

low us some of the commission on all the orders
we send him."

“Two customers already isn't so bad for us,”
said Maxie.

“Especially when we made $500 out of the
first one, with more to follow,” said J chnny.

The girls didn't remain long, as they had some
"shopping to do, and there “was nothing to detain
them. That evening Johnny called at Broker
Simms and her mother. He spent a pleasant
evening and was invited to call again. Next
morning he received a telegram from Ilen Mar-
shall telling him to look out for developments in
the Red Gnome mine. The Westerner said that a
letter was on the way to him. The letter ar-
rived on the following day. It contained the offi-
cial appointment of Johnny Jones & Co., as East-
ern representatives of the Red Gnome Mining
and Milling Co., signed by Marshall as president.
There was a friendly enclosure from Hen, who
told Johnn to have the name cf the mine paint-
ed on his oor. Johnny got a sign painter to do
it. Three days later the news came out about
the settlement between the railroad companies,
and D. & J. advanced 5 points right awa . Two
days more it advanced another 6 and a raction.
Johnny sold out at once. When he settled with
the little bank be deducted $667 from the profits
and added it to his private resources, making
him worth $2,700. Th rest of the money went
into the firm, making its capital $11,500.

“You are now full-ﬂedged partners, girls," he
told Kane and Kitty that afternoon. “We have
also added a third customer to our establishment
—a man from Cadiz, over in Jersey. He saw our
advertisement in a ﬁnancial paper, too. He sent
us 8500 to buy him 50 shares of D. & L.”

“If the customers keep on coming we’ll need a
bookkeeper,” said Maxie ~

“We'll get one when we have work enough to

kee him fairly busy.”
o dials later the news was ﬂashed into the

Johnny. .

were out, and the other 50,000 would shortly fol-
low, and the stock was being dealt in, it was nec-
essary that the oﬂice should be kept open all

"I’l have to get a smart oﬁice boy to help out.”
said John to himself. '“I can't stay in the
oﬂce my all the time.” _

So he advertised in one of the morning dailies,
and directed applicants to apply'by mail in their
own handwriting, giving reference and particu-
lars as to ability, for he did not want a small
army of turbulent boys besieging his oﬂice and
obstructing the corridor. He got a hundred_or

, - more replies to his advertisement, and picking

»  out the most promising of the bunch asked the

lads to call at different hours.

After interviewing all of them he ﬁnally se-
lected one, whose name was Tom Johnson, and
this lad he started in at $5 a week. His office
hours were from nine to four, except on Satur-
day, when his time’w'as u at half—past twelve.
He was given charge of e transfer book, and
it was his duty to make out the new certiﬁcate
and deliver them when called for. He proved to
be smart and capable, and Johnny was weli
pleased with him. When the price of Red Gnome
advanced to a dollar, Johnny received instruc-
tions from Marshall to let the rest _of the stock

He did so, and Marshall and his associates

realized a proﬁt of $68,000 on the transaction

Johnny remitted the money in sections, with_ his

‘ statements‘, and when the Western men received
the ﬁnal settlement, Marshall sent the young ﬁrm

himself and his partners.

“I see,” said the lady.

“The company's secretarv also sends us a rec-
ord of all transfers made in the West. so that
ou_r.stock book is a practical duplicate of the
original at the home oﬂice."

“I didn't know the method of stock transfers be-

, fore, never having had occasion to ask my hus-

band about it. I have learned something new by
calling on you," she smiled.

“I guess we all learn something new every day
of our lives."

“You have to be wide-awake to keep up with

Wall Street, I guess."

“Yes, ma’am. You can't go to sleep down here
and expect to succeed."

“Do you deal altogether in mining shares?"

“No, ma’am. We got our start through deals
that were put through the New York Stock Ex-
change fcr us."

_ “My husband has done a little business for you
in that line, I believe?”

“Not much, and only transactions for the few
customers we have on our books at present. You
see, we are not rich enough to be represented on
the board of the Exchange, except by proxy. \\'e
have to employ a member to operate for us. Nat-
urally that makes a big hole in our commissions.
in fact, according to the rules. we are not en-
titled to participate in the commission at all, but
brokers do make an allowance. notwithstanding,
otherwise, we outsiders couldn't make anything
at all on our business. Mr. Simms is very gener-
ous in that respect, and we hope in time to give
him considerable business, when we get it. At
present we rely on private deals of our own when
we see a chance to make something in that line.
We have received two or three good tips that have
helped us, but such things are like angels’ visits.’

The lady looked at him reﬂectively.

“I might give you a tip myself, if you would
proimise not to tell anybody else about it,’ she
sai

“You can reply on my honor, Mrs. Simms.’

“Very well. I am under a great obligation to
youandwouldliketorepayitiflcould. My
husband has Just been employed by a big syn-
dicate to buy L. & M. stock, with a view of

himself, as he left the ban “Nothing like av-
’ a good tip to back your money with.’

en he went to the Stock Exchange to see
how things were coming on in the board room,
by taking a bird's eye view of the ﬂoor from the

ery.

Mazie and Kitty made their appearance shortly
after four. Johnny told them the tip he had got
from the lady to whom he had rendered the serv-
ive on 42d street.

“She assured me that it would prove a winner,
so I bought 1,000 shares of L. & M. We ought
to malie $10,000 at least out of this deal, and
that would raise our capital to something over
$20,000.‘ . _

The girls were delighted at the idea of making
more money, and Maxie’!-emarked that before
long they would be coming to their offices in an
automobile. Next morning Johnny bought 200
shares more for his private account, and then he
devoted the major part of his attention to watch-
ing the market. During the next ten days L. &
M. began to attract a certain amount of atten-
tion, as he speculators saw that it was gradually
rising. A large amount of business was done in
it, and it ﬁnally reached 97. Then it suddenly

booming like a house aﬁre. Johnny held
on till it struck 105, when, from the volume of
sales, he began to think that the insiders were
raﬁidly unloading.

e gave his order to sell both lots. They
went at 105%. At that ﬁgure the ﬁrm reaped
a proﬁt of $15,500, raising their capital to $27,000,
and Johnny himself made about $3,000, which
made him worth $6,000 outside of his business
interests. Before this he had told his mother
and sister that he was out of Broker Judson’s
employ and in business for himself under the
name of Johnny Jones & Co.

As he appeared to be making money, they had

, no fault to ﬁnd with the change. Soon after the
successful closing out of the L. & M. deal Johnny
received a letter from the president of a new
Paradise minin company, asking him if his ﬁrm
would act as! all Street representative of the
Yellow Jacket Mining Company. He was re-

ter, and Johnny carried it to the office of Brew-
ster & Co. and delivered it to Mr. Brewster. ‘

“What do you ‘want to know, young man?’
asked Brewster.

Johnny told him. _ »

“Are you thinking of buying Phoenix Copper to
make a little money?" asked the broker, who sup-
posed the boy to be some young friend of Sirnms’,
and did not dream that he was in business in
Wall Street. ‘

“Yes, sir."

“Well, I don't want you to go around telling
all your friends that I advised you to buy
Phoenix. Keep my advice to yourself, under-
stand? Phoenix is ruling at about $7 now. Put
your money into it right away and hold on till
it gets up to around $12, and then sell quick.
You’ll make a little stake. Then‘ put your money
in the bank and let it stay there. Speculating in
the market is a bad thing for boys. G0od- y.’

Johnny left Brewster’s office with a chuckle.

. “He thinks I'm a little tender lamb. I reckon
he'd be mightily surprised to learn that I'm head
of an enterprising ﬁrm right here in the Street,
with a capital cf $27,000 behind us. I guess

wouldn't have given me that tip, for that's what
it really amounts to. Buy Phoenix Copper at
$7 and sell it at $12. Evidently he has a pretty
clear idea that it's going to 812. Well, I guess
Johnny Jones & Co. will make another raise in
capital right here. I'm going to buy 3,000 shares
outright, if I can get them, and if the price
goes to $12 we'll clear $15,000. At any rate, the
firm can’t lose much, for Phoenix Copper is not
likely to dro anything to speak of, i! a screw
should work oose in Mr. Brewster's pointer."

So Johnny called on a Curb broker he had had
dealings with and left his order for 3,000 shares
or any part of that number, at the market price.
When his partners came in that afternoon he told
them about the new deal.

“Mr. Brewster as as told me I’d make $5
a share on my deal if I bought Phoenix Copper
at $7,” said ohnny. “I suppose he thought I
had a few hundred dollars that I wanted to add
to. This looks as if it’s going to be another lucky
deal for us, girls."

“The tips seem to be coming your way now,
Johnny," said Mazie. “This is the second you've
had in succession."

“What's the difference as long as we get them?"

“Why, you're doing all the work and we're
doing nothing. It isn't fair."

“What do you care as long as I'm not kicking?’ ,

“Well, you should have a full half interest in‘
the ﬁrm, instead of a third, and Kitty and I a
quarter each.”

“That's the way we want it, Johnny,’ said
Kitty. ‘Marie and I, have been talking it over,
and we want you to ﬁx the partnership papers
that way.» You’r really the whole ' , any- ‘ '
way. ou’re building up the business, w 'le we ~ .

“Nonsense! All the verbal bouquets in the

At that moment there was a noise outside the
window. The form of a rough-looking man, with

' 3 hard face,‘ came crawling along the coping out-

side. Both girls so as the window crashed
open and Johnny [sprang to his feet in time to see
a villainous-looking man climbing into the oiﬁce.

in baleful look on the boy broker.

“Shut up, or you'll regret it!" hissed the in-

er.

“What did you come in here for?" _

“That's my business. Just you keep quiet.”

The man walked to the door and listened. Ap-
parently satisﬁed that the coast was clear, he
turned the handle and started to make his exit,
when Johnny seized a heavy book from his desk
and dun it at the fellow's head. It hit the
mark an the man staggered half out into the

the strength of Johnny’s story, and what he saw,
he handcuﬁed the rascal and telephoned to the
station-house for the patrol wagon. He also
communicated with the nearest hospital and asked
that an ambulance be sent. . By this time the
news had spread through the building, and a big
crowd had assembled in the corridor. Johnny
returned to his omce ‘and told the girls about the

. giscovery that he and the janitor had made next

oor. ,

. “It’s a wonder that we didn’t hear some sounds
showing there was trouble in there," he said.
“The rascal must have surprised the old man
somehow and struck him down before he could
cry out-” ~

“I didn’t hear anything,” said Mazie.

“Neither did I,” said Kitty.

“We were too interested in our own business
to pay attention to matters on the outside,” said
Johnny. “Well, I'm goin back to see what the
ambulance surgeon says a. t Benson. You wait
here and I'll take you to the station when the
excitement is over.” . .

Thus speaking, Johnny left the oﬁice. The sur-
geon had just arrived. He examined the uncon-
scious money-lender and soon brought him to
his senses. Benson explained to the policeman
that the prisoner had entered his office without
knocking, handed him a tale of hard luck and
asked for a quarter to pay’ for a meal and bed.

He refused to give up, as he didn’t like the
man's appearance nor his manner, jvhereupon the
caller ulled something from his pocket and
struck  down. That was all he remembered
till revived by the surgeon. The oﬂicer called his
attention to the open safe and the empty tin box
on the ﬂoor. He declared that the man had rob-
bed him of the-contents of the box, amounting to
a considerable sum.  prisoner was searched
and the sum of $70 in bills and a couple of do}-
lars in change was found in one of his pockets.

Benson asserted that was the amount that had
been in the box at the time the man entered his

bail. Johnny then returned to Wall Street. He
did not go directly to his oﬂice, but sought the
Curb market, where he found that Phoenix Cop-
per had gone up 50 cents.

_“Hello, Johnny Jones!” cried a trader, slapping
him on the back. “I see that you distinguished
yourself yesterday afternoon by aiding in the
capture of a crook in your building.”

I guess that was my duty under the circum-
stances,” replied the boy broker.

“It would appear so,_ but it isn’t everybody who
would tackle a man with a loaded revolver. You
are a plucky lad. By the way, I see you are
advertising a new mmin company—-the Yellow
Jacket. Your firm is acting as promoters of it,

“Yes, sir. Want to buy a few thousand shares?”

“No, thanks. I've been bitten by prospects be-
fore,".laughed the broker.

“This one might be a winner.”

“I know. That’s what they all say.”

“You can't expect to get something good for
nextsgo nothing unless you take a risk.”

“There are chances enough in Wall Street with-
out going West for them.”

“Some people let their chances slip out of their
hands. Nearly a dozen brokers let go of their
Red Gnome holdings at 10 cents and under, and
now,look at it-—it’s quoted at $1.25 this morn-
ing.’

_ “And you are the boy who bought it up. Who
did [you buy it for?”

“ customer.”

“Too bad you didn’t buy it yourself.
have made a wad."

“That wasn't my luck. However, our ﬁrm has
made a good thing out our connection with it.”

‘“Yes, I suppose so. on are agents for the
mine now.”

“What do you think of Phoenix Copper?"

‘'1 think it'll go to 38 before noon. It appears
to be in considerable demnd.”

“I’ll give you $8 for 1,000 shares on a ten-
day option," said Johnny.

The broker shook his head.

“Make it nine dollars and I'll go you,” he said.

Johnny appeared to hesitate.

“I’1l give you $8 for a ﬁve-day option," he said.

“No” replied the trader. “I wouldn't take the
chances under $9."

“Then we can't do business on that line. I'll
tell you what you can do for me.” said Johnny,
after a moment's thought. “You can buy me
1,000 shares at the market, and I'll pay you on
delivery of the certiﬁcates. This deal isn't for
the firm, but for me, individually."

“All right. I'll do it," said the broker, and
the exchanged memoranduins.

ohnny was $1,500 shy of the purchase price,
but he decided to borrow the diﬁerence from the
firm’s balance of $6,000. He waited around till
the broker got the stock at $7.50 and notiﬁed
him, then went to his ofﬁce. The certiﬁcates were
delivered to him the next day, with the broker’:

~ ‘Then Kitty and I are each worth $10,000?”

in the business and $10,000 outside of it. I guess
v-I did_n’t make any mistake in starting up this
‘business of ours,” he said.
“ 4. “I should say not,” replied Kitty.
“Judson did me a big favor when he bounced

hadn't done it I would still be running errands
‘T: for him at a measly $8 a week." _
5. “Funny how things turn out. isn't it?" said
" Mazie.
f‘Bet your life it is! Well, girls, if we kee on

said that we would keep the brokers g-uessin .

}. ‘ “How much of the Yellow Jacket stock have
 you sold so far?" asked Kitty.

“About half of it. Here are a dozen letters
that came in this afternoon» All inquiries which
the boy mailed literature to before he went
home.”

“I su pose you'll sell the whole lot?”

“If I don't I shall be much surprised."
‘ At that moment a district messenger boy walk-

in. -
. “Mr. Johnny Jones?" he asked.

. “That's my name," said Johnny.
H The lad handed him a letter and the slip to
sign. Johnny opened the letter and read it.

“An order for 10,000 shares of Yellow.Jacket,"

~ he said, after the messenger had gone.

“Fine!” said Kitty. ‘

“Wants me to bring the certiﬁcates to his oﬁlce
on Canal street this afternoon and he'll give me
a certiﬁed check on the Bowery National.”

‘ ‘!It’s going on ﬁve, you'd better_ start. Johnny,’
laid Mazie. “Come, Kitty, we will go home.”

window and looked down into a narrow yard
ﬁlled with bits of lumber used by the picture
frame manufacturer. He shut down the window
and proceeded to kick a panel out of the other
door. He didn't succeed as well as he had with
the_ﬁrst door, as it was a stouter one. However
he intended to get out, so he upset the desk and
pulled one of the legs of it, after some trouble.
With this he again attacked the door and suc-
ceedad in smashing one of the upper panels. He
reached through, turned the key and got into the
outer room. He still had the corridor door to
overcome, and he judged the man had carried
the key of that away with him. He used the
desk leg on the panels and smashed them. That
didn’t do him any good, and he attacked the lock.
He couldn't do anything with it. He sat down
to rest himself and consider the situation. He
noticed a door in the corner of the room. He
walked over and opened it. It disclosed a closet.
011 the ﬂoor lay a large rusty chisel. -
‘Maybe I can force the lock with this,” he said.
He tried the ex riment without much result.
Then he sta to dig the wood away from
the side of the lock. It was now growin dark
and he would soon be unable to see what e was
doing. He redoubled his exertions and ﬁnally
broke his way through and got the door open.
With the chisel in his hand he rushed downstairs.
When he reached the front door onthe ground

ﬂoor he found it locked. He broke it open in a

few minutes and stepped out on Canal street.

“Free at last!” he muttered, with a feeling of
satisfaction. “Now to ﬁnd the nearest station-
house.” <

He made inquiries at several stores and ﬁnally
was directed to the Eleventh Precinct, on Mul-
berry street.

He hastened there and told his story. He fur-
nished a description of Tully and the boy, and the
officer at the desk promised to attend to the mat-
ter. There was nothing left for Johnny but to go
home. He was on his way to the Bleecker street
station when passing a corner he was surprised
to see Thlly come out of a saloon, accompanied
by the boy with the carotty hair and a big man

' whom he did not recognize, but suspected it was

the fellow who had handled him so roughly. He
noticed that Tully carried his package of Yellow
Jacket certiﬁcates under his arm. He fell in
behind them and kept his eyes on the alert. for a
policeman. The trio were headed forthe Bowery,
just as Johnny was. When they reached tlyat
thoroughfare they crossed over and the young
broker followed. They walked up to Houston
street and turned down that thoroughfare. Half
a block from the Bowery they entered a shabby-
looking building.

Johnny noted the house and, walking up to it,-
obtained the number. A short distance away was
a drug store. , After watching the house for a
few minutes the boy started for the druggist's.

He called up the Mulberry street police station
and told the man at the desk that he had spotted
the parties who had robbed him on Canal street.

They had gone into No.— Houston street. He
resuested that a couple of oﬁlcers be sent to the
‘address at once, and he would meet them out-
side.— He was told that a couple of detectivu
would go up there at once. Fifteen minutes
later the men appeared, and recognized Johnny

The former had learned of the projected operav
tions of a  syndicate formed to corner and
boom 0. & ., and Johnny immediately bought
4,000 shares of the stock. The ﬁrm cleared
$52,000 on the deal, while ‘Johnny made $12,500
out of it on the side. Kitty"s»ti was an equally
good one, and as the ﬁrm ha ‘$94,000 to use.

2,000 for himself, of S. & T. 

He dumped these shares suddenly on the mar.
ket when he found that the price began to look
top-heavy, and a

stock to come to the surface. Johnny Jones was
now worth $50,000 himself, and the ﬁrm had
$200.000 in its business. Already the little oﬁlce
on the sixth ﬂoor was too contracted for their
line of operations, though Johnny managed to do
all his bookkeeping himself with the assistance
of Tom Johnson.

The ﬁrm had secured the agency for two other
Western mines of good standi the Little
Jumbo Extension and the Round op-through
the friendly inﬂuence of Hen Marshall. On the
day following the trial of. the Fletcher crowd,
Johnny Jones & Co. receiveda proposition to
market the shares of a leasin syndicate which
had taken over the Yellow Jac et for a— term of
months. Johnny. of course, accepted it and got
busy in the Street with it. Not a trader dreamed
that it was Johnny Jones & Co. that had greatly
embarrassed the S. & T. syndicate. and made a big
hole in its proﬁts.

Johnny learned that a firm of lawyers, having
a three—room suit—-two small and one large room
—on the ﬂoor below were going to move to Broad-
way, and were looking for a tenant to take the
lease of their hands.‘ It had ayear and a month

' Johnrlfmy wondered if it wouldn't be a good idea
to try and buy some of the shares, if the ﬁrm
could get them, and hold them in expectation that
either side might want them, and pay a premium
to get them. The ﬁrm_had_ $200,000 lyllllf idle,
and he believed in getting it at work. e had
a talk with the girls before he made any move,
though he knew they were in favor of an hing
he suggested, because he believed the ad a
right to pass on any deal he took hol of. Of
course, they told him to go ahead.

“I can’t go.ahead till I learn where I can get
some of the shares," he said. “I've already made
Inquiries and ﬁnd there are none on the open
market now.” ' _

“Maybe I an ﬁnd out from Mr. Sanders," said
 “He knows most everything that 18 going
on.

She did try, and learned that a friend of her
cmployer’s, a widow lady, owned 1,000 shares of
the Suburban Trolley Road. The stock, however,
was not for sale, and she so reported to Johnny.

Suburban Trolley stock generally ruled around
105. It was now going at 112. Johnny got the
lady’s address and called on her. He didn't be-
lieve that his visit would be roductive of results,
but he wasn't letting the sm lest chance t away
from him. Luck, however, played into his hands.

The lady had just learned. that she could buy
a certain property near her own on which‘ she
hadlai hadaneye. Shehadmadeu hermind
to sell her trolley shares to the presi ent of the
road, whose propositions she had turned down a
week previous. When Johnny introduced himself
.and.tho object of his visit, she supposed he came

from the resident, and ,:she said she’d sell her
stock for 12,000 cash. a
“All right, ma'am,” said Johnny. “We'll draw
up a paper to that eifect and I’ll pay you $1,000
to bind it. To-marrow I'll bring a certiﬁed check
for $111,000.’

“Show him in,’ said Johnny.

Mr. Simms walked into Johnny's private room.

“Mr. Simms, allow me to present my partners,’
said Johnny.

“Say, this is one of your jokes, isn't it?”

“No, sir. It's the real Simon-pure fact. These
girls have been my partners from the day we
started in on a capital of $2,500, in the little ~
room on the ﬂoor above. This is the ﬁrm that is
now keeping the brokers guessing who the Co. is.
Keep it quiet, and let them keep on guessing.
You’re the only trader in the Street who knows
who M. Green and K. Brown really are.”

The broker nodded and he promised to keep
mum.

Before he left he handed the certiﬁed check to ‘
Johnny, and next day Johnny paid it to the
widow and got the stock. He didn’t have it
transferred, but notiﬁed the majority and minori-
ty committees of the trolley road, anonymously,
that the widow had sold her stock to the writer.

Immediately, both parties, after verifying the
sale, started to guess who had it, for as matters
stood the 1,000 shares would give the minority
the control. The boy broker published an adver-
tisement in the Wall Street News, saying that
the stock was for sale to the highest bidder, and
bids must be made through Johnny Jones & Co.,
of the Addison Building.

Representatives from both committees called
on Johnny and made oﬂ’ers. He played one
against the other till the minority people oﬁered
150 for the stock. Johnny's sympathy was with
them and he accepted. Then he sent the stock
to the secretary’s oﬁice to be transferred to the
name of Johnny Jones & Co. When the new cer-
tiﬁcates were returned to the ﬁrm, with another
offer from the majority, Johnn sent them back
with the word that they wereso d, and asked that
they be transferred to the new owner.

‘That gave the minority control and Johnny
Jones & Co., a roﬁt of $38,000. The young ﬁrm
was now wo over a quarter of a million.
Shortly afterward the secret of the do. got out,
and there was great astonishment in Wall Street.
and scores of brokers called on Johnny for Ca
introduction He requested them all to call in a.
bunch one afternoon after four. With the rece
tion-room full of curious traders, he led Maxi:
and Kitty’into the room, and taking his place
between them said: ‘ '

“Gentlemen, this is Johnny Jones J: Co., the '
ﬁrm that kept the brokers guessing, and Miss
Marie and I are engaged to be married.”

CHAPTER XV. ‘ 
The Finish of the Game and What Happened. °

Sam had laced the orange in his coat pocket,
with the be 'ef that there was surely something 1
wrong with it. He meant to ﬁnd out after the .

game.
He said nothing to any of the players, for he
realized that it was lay ball, and that nothing-
must get into their eads other than the game

The  Detective

. Speculation as to who had murdered George
Judson had long since died out. The murder had
been the usual nine days’ wonder when Judson
had been found dead in a small private room of
a hotel of questionable character.

3 To this room were two entrances, one opening
into a hall leading to the barroom, the other into
another hall and _down a private stairway to the

reet.
, The street door was seldom fastened.
Judson must have entered by this door and the
murderer likewise, although no living soul had
- observed the latter enter or depart.

At ﬁrst suspicion’s ﬁnger was directed toward
the proprietor of the place, but as nothing could
he proved against him he was released; justly,
too, ‘I at the time decided, for I knew in my
heart that, although a bad man, the proprietor
had never committed this murder.

But who had?

,- There was the rub.

. The coroner's jury decided that “he came to

his deathnat the hands of a person or persons
own

And this was absolutely all that was known,
two years later, by which time the circumstances
were well-nigh fo tten. But then one day,.in
looking over the ‘ ersonals,” I saw one which
it struck me concealed something, and which I
 again and pondered over.

‘ “Tom—Where are you? I am in distress, and
need money. If you §on’t answer this, I'll tell
all I know about that %n aﬁair. KATE."
.“'I‘hat ‘J—-—n aﬂair?’ What aﬁair was that?

murder ﬂashed suddenly across my brain. “Thun-

FAME AND FORTUNE WEEKLY

The next day I inserted in the “Personals" the

. following:

_ 11 ii‘ bu ' frequ, tl oi English-,«‘~4
ed away %.‘I?irng ipeoplesxiiinedshad givedln  -at

“Kate-—Meet me at the corner of Broadway
and Fourth street to-night at ten. Ton.”

_ Full of hope,  that night hung about the de-
signated spot until long after the hour mentioned.
B_ut Kate did not appear, nor did she the next
night nor the one following; nor could I get her
to answer numerous “Personals” inserted from
time to time. In the very teeth of a most auspi-
cious beginning I was sadly balked.

. «But I did not yet despair of success, although
it was several months later before I again picked
up the clew.

While examining the passenger list of a steam-
er, and asking questions about the passengers of
her last trip, for an entirely different purpose,

I had described to me the very woman I was
after, this very Kate.

She was traveling with an elderly gentleman
who bought tickets for “Nicholas Turner and
wife.”

Slight as was my grounds for supposing that
this was the woman who had advertised in the
“Personals,” and not knowing for a certainty
whether J n meant Judson, I determined to
follow her up. Many of my professional brethren
would have laughed at me for putting so much
faith in the case; but I did not give them the
chance to laugh, for I kept the whole thing to
myself. . '
Judson had been very wealthy, and all his
relations were rich also.

‘They had offered a handsome reward for-the
miirderer’s being brought to justice.

“No, I'll keep it to myself,” I said. “If I sue-
ceed I’ll make a nice stake; if I fail none shall
know it.”

I took the next steamer for England and thence
followed “Nichola Turner and wife” to Paris._ —
Here for a time I was at fault, for had
changed the name they sailed under to . '1‘.
I-Iowelland wife." But I caught the clew at last,
and ﬁnally tracked them to Italy—to Rome.

For many days I paced the streets hopin to
get ‘a glimpse of my birds, but as time p on

‘without meeting them I began to feel discouraged.

Finally, I determined to do what I should have
done in the first place, and went to the oﬂice of
the police.

I stated the case, and asked their advice toward
discovering if they still remained in Rome.

“Better consult Zanfretta,” I was ﬁnally told.

“Who is he?”

“A beggar, but just the man you want.”

“Where does he live?”

I received minute directions, and about three
o'clock that afternoon I found myself in one of
the 'dirtiest and ﬁlthiest holes I have ever seen. -
It was a large, massive building, but the rooms
were very small and very dirty.

In one of them I found Zanfretta.

I told him who had sent me. i "

I described Kate.

“She is in Rome," he said quietly, and yet posi-
tively. .

“Can you tell me anything more of her? Where
she lives, and how?" ’
- A shrewd look crossed the beggar’s face.

“It is usual at this stage of the business to say
lgglvv much my services are worth," he said point-

y.
“How much do you want?”

“Say twenty dollars.”

‘_‘I’ll make it twenty-ﬁve if you work up the

“Done,” he said. “Ritta and myself will do it

The remark drew myattention to two guests
of the hotel. The gentleman was tall, wel -built
and handsome; his face was ﬁnely molded, and a
heavy mustache drooped over h s mouth. The
lad was fairer complexioned than he was, and
wel‘ merited the adjective—“beautiful."

my eyes from him when I saw his head raised,
saw the little girl bend her eyes_ keenly on some
one approaching gram the opposite direction. It
was a woman, an one.

Was it Kate? _ _ .

I shrank back out of sight, but in such a posi-

_ tion as to witness what transpired. Zanfretta

was supposed to be blind, but he had eyes keener
than mine, in truth, and I saw that he was
watching the woman, now almost beside him. _
Tom Corsa and Lucy were now also near him;
he was bending wvard Luci, speaking tender
words of love, when I saw im suddenly raise
his head. The dark-complexioned woman had
uttered an exclamation of surprise.
' ' Corsa started, his ﬁat clenched, his face paled:

The mosquito oﬁcnsivc may be conducted with

from Texas that the ancient and much maligned
bat is ﬁghting the pest.

Even the Bible brands the but as unclean and
from3Ke8Dastthis,oneoftheoldestofmain-
inals, has been regarded as a thing of evil. Man
has left it to its desolate caverns and deserted

towers, shunning it as a symbol of wickedness -

and ruin, and women have run from it in terror,
believing that its one purpose in life is to en-
tangle itself in the human hair.

This little creature has never known anything
from mankind but unpopularity. There is, how-

ever. another creature of the night which men '

loathe even more, the mosquito. and here the but
has found a chance to redeem itself. Where bats
have been used to ﬁght mosquitoes there have been
people who at first declared they would rather
have the insects than the animals, but later, it is
said, they changed their minds when aware of
the results of the work.

GERMANS PAY $1 A YEAR RENT; NEVER
RAISED IN 409 YEARS
' In the face of an acute housing shortage
throughout Germany, residents of F erei have
continued to pay $1 a year as rent. T e rate has
not changed for 409 years.

Fuggerei is the oldest urban settlement in Ger‘
many still used for residence ‘purposes. It is a
city within a city, a part of ugsburg. ~

Jacob Fugger, a German merchant prince of
the sixteenth century, laid out a site for housing
people of small ‘means, and today 106 families
have cause to bless his memory.

Their rent has not been raised for exactly 409
years, and the only conditions attached to the
tenancy is that they shall be Catholics, that they
shall follow a trade and not be in receipt of
public charity. »

A TZZRIVING VILLAGE DWINDLES AS FISH
DESERT BLACK RIVER. .

The little settlement of Black River, on the
shores of the Bay of Fundy, wasestimated twen-
ty-ﬁve years a to have 4,000 inhabitants. For
more than ha] a century it was a resort for the
ﬁshermen. Particularly favored by nature, the
adjacent waters were teeming with lobsters, her-
ring and line-and-seine fish of many varieties.
Hundreds of small ﬁshing vessels were built and
launched. Black River was a typical, prosperous
Nova Scotian ﬁshing village.

Today it has a population of less than a hun-
dred and its former ﬁsher folk have scattered to?
other coastal sections of the United States’ or
Canada. For some reason the bottom has dropped

from the Black River ﬁsheries. Fish that 
prodigal in numbers a few years ago seem liters:

ally to have_ left the waters. 1

Two score years ago Black River ﬁshermen:
