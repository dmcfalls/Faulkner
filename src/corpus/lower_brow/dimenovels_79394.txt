PATSY’S REMARKABLE COMPACT.

Edited by CHICKERING CARTER.

CHAPTER‘ I. -

TAKING A DESPERATE CHANCE. ,

Chick and Patsy, with Danny: the chauffeur, had just

9 passed through one of the most" thrilling and exciting
experiences of their lives. Theyyhad been in what Patsy
,facetiously called an “automobile duel,” and the sur-

 « 4 prising part of it was that they had come out of it with:

their lives.* t . A V .
V They had captured Jasper Ryan, for whom“ Patsy,
'\ y ’ under the name of Alan Gwynn, was acting as chauffeur;
 ‘V ’\they had‘ nearly wrecked two automobiles, and Chick
V incidentally had received a bullet in his left shoulder
from one oi Ryan's pistols. Fortunately it was not a
seridiis wound, although he'realized that he wouldhave
;  to lay by for ‘repairs for a few weeks.
,' P V They had taken their rprisoner, whom Patsy had
7,,‘ ‘knocked on the head with one of his own pistols, to the
residence of Richard Baxter, in Eightygtliird Street, near

.,.

the Drive, where Nick Carter and Conroy Conne'r,,of the V

secret service, were awaiting news of them, Mrs. Bax-
, ter being Conner’s sister. Danny had been senton‘ to the

Ryan had been knocked senseless by the blow that;
Patsy dealt him, and ’had been bundled inside the bod
of thelgbig Packard———a liinousine——and Patsy hadid
rected Danny to tie him securely with one of the tug‘.
ropes‘. ’ Z ' e _ i

’ But the time had. been short, and Patsy had
unable to give the prisoner his personal attention. Dana
had reported, however, that theman was so knocked of
that he didn’t needtying, but that he had tiedhi-m up=al
theesame, according to orders. Chick, being wound?
was unable to lend a hand. The time was midnight.

vWheﬁ the Packard drew up in front of Mrs. Baitter
home, ‘Chick descended pah_1ful1y,~ and, pausing rﬁo ,
moment, said to Patsy’: A. . ' "’ it

“I’ll_go. inside and report, Patsy. You stay oluthh
and guard the prisoneruwill you ?’’t , _ i M

“Sure, Chick,” was the quick reply; ‘_‘You’re as Wlii
as a sheet. Have them dress your wound for'you;lie;wii
you try to come out again. I’ll be all right.” 1 A’

And so Chick had gone inside the house with *theC
news helhad. to carry. M ' V ‘ M *

“opened it and peerecl inside. '

‘ ‘Ryan, apparently still unconscious and ‘wrapped in
fmany coils of the tug—rope as ‘Danny had adjusted it,
_'was_ propiped up in one corner of the interior, breathing
"heavily, and for :1 moment‘, the young’ detective wondered

V permitted, but taking care not to exceed,‘ it, untilt_~.he
~: turned into Central Park West. A

As he was passing the Hotel Majestic, he noticed an-

, other Packard limousine car standing unattended at the

curb. It was a car of exactly the same type as the one

I he was driving, and‘ instantly it occurred to Ryan how

, to make a really brilliant move. _,

He-drew up behind the other machine and got down.

Then he looked carefully around ,him, to discover, as

he hoped would be the case, that no one was near enough

to ‘observe his movements; and he moved quickly, but

isilently.

He opened the tool—box of his ownmachine and se— I

I cured a pair of ,pliers, and then he deftly removed the
 three license numbers from the rear of his own car.’ He
had noticed that the other Packard also carried three

.. numbers; , Vi . .
Again taking stock of his surroundings, he glided for-

 ward, and with deft and rapidly moving hands and ﬁn- ,

gers he presently succeeded in removing the numbers
‘from the other car and replacing them with those he had
carried. , I 3
 After that it was the ,work of aicouple of moments
' only to adjust the stolen numbers to what he was pleased

/

now to call his own car; and then he returned to ‘the.

 driver’s seat arid started on again. 1 ” 7- « »i P A

PATSY HAS A HEADACHE.

   
    
 

When Patsy opened his eyes to consciousness after  .
morphin sleep that Ryan had compelled him to take, 

 

erablei as a man can be, and keep alive

For a moment he thought‘ he was alone, and 
aloud, while at the same time he wondered‘ where, jh

 

 was.

He" saw the surroundings of a comfortable $3

sloping roo_i on either side, in which were dormer-win

Presently, when his eyes‘ became a‘c,customed_to_'

a man seated in an. armchair over by one of _thei,v’v

words in the language to express my contempt for a man

Before, you dreaded lest she discovered you to b'e a
bigamist; later, you would have dreaded_lest she discover
you to be a thief. Tell me this: Of the two, which would
you now prefer she should have known ?”.

“The ﬁrst, Patsy, the first, ‘because she would know
that that crime was committed for love of her.” ‘

“Well, Ryan, don’t forget that she knows both, now”,

“I had not. thought of that,” said Ryan in a harsh
whisper. “I had not thought of that ;” arid for a ('1/iiarter
of an hour he sat staring straight ahead of him with un-
\vinking eyes, seeing nothing. ' ' 4 A

At the end of that time he rose abruptly and left the
room, nor did Patsy see him again for another hour.

But the young detective improved the time, ﬁrst, by '
searching vainly for his clothing, and then’ in thinking
deeply upon the circumstance in which he was placed. , A A

He wondered if he could not somehowvturn it to -ac-‘ 

A count; he wondered if it were not possible to prevail upon ’

Ryan to give up the stolen money. . n A

He had discovered during the interview that Ryan
had a heart that could be touched, if one knew how to
reach it, and Patsy‘ wondered if he ‘could not somehow
reach it in a way that would be lasting and telling.

“I wonder how? I wonder how?” he kept saying to’ .
himself; and he was still thinking it when Ryan returned; '

Every evidence of his interview with Patsy had disap- A
peared, and, outwardly at least, he was the same carelessf .,
daredevil. Ryan, as ever, as well prepared for akettle‘-I

And so Patsy, whose headache had by now almost
gone, dressed himself quickly, after which he wrote:

“DEAR CHIEF: With theiexéieption of the fact that I

morphin administered by Ryan, I am perfectly well,

 NEW NICK CARTER WEEKLY".

At seven they reached another village, where they ran
the machine under a shed and went into the little hotel
for their breakfast. '

“I think, Ryan,” said Patsy, while they were ﬁlling up
with the good things to be found in the'5'country, “that

our car is rather too big for us. Don’t you think———-”
“Hush, Patsy. We’re going to have trouble here.”
,. “Eh? Why so.”

“There is one of those smart-Aleek country constables
out there. You didn’t happen to‘notice him, but I did.
He was piping us off through the window as we drove
into the yard, but he stepped back out of sight when we

‘entered the hotel oﬂice. He is outside now, inspecting
the car.” ' '

_ “By Jove! He’ll get the number of the car itself, won’t I

:- he?”
I “Much good it will do him’. It is_like the license num-
bers; it has been changed.”

I _“What? Do you mean to tell me that you have suc—p,a.

ceeded in changing even that number?” ‘
«‘‘Certainly. I spent two hourslat it this morning. I
succeeded, too.” I
“Tell me what you did.” .
_. “There are two ‘eights’ in the number. I did a very
,’ simple thing. I_ altered them to r_epr'esent, ‘threes.’ It

was quite a job to do it nicely, and leave no traceof the I

fact that a change had been made; but I think'I ,suc-
ceeded.” , l . " .
“And the license numbers are all right. You have
made four changes in that respect,‘ haven’t you ?” M l I
I “Yes. I’ think they will be some time in getting to the
"numbers we are wearing now; but all the same, those
. numbers leave a trail behind them which must be fol-

lowed sooner or later. But I have got a scheme ahead ,
You shall hear it.

“Well, Patsy, you'll_never get it.”

“I think I will; we’ll see.”

For a moment Ryan stared at liim in admiration, and
at lasthe blurted out: _

“Look here, Patsy, bad as I am, I like you clear down
to the ground. You’re all right, and I wish-I was good
enough to command your respect and your affection. But
I want to say this to you: We’re together, and if you" “
can beat me at the game we are playing, I’ll pat you on I
the back and say: ‘Well done, old chap !’ ”

The door of the room in which they were breakfasting
opened at that moment, and a tall, angular man of ﬁfty;

or so‘ entered the room. ’ ‘ _
He came straight to the table where they were seated, 

and unceremoniously pulled a. chair from under it at the

‘opposite side and seated himself; but all the while he kept; 

his eyes riveted on the face of Ryan. .
“Good morning, Mister Ryan?” he said, after a mo-W1’
merit, and in as ‘cool. and matter—of—f,act way asyif he

and Ryanwere old acquaintances. ,, ‘ . V

But Ryan only stared at him for a moment, and then
burst out laughing. ‘ " I
‘,‘Where did you get it, old chap?” he asked pleasantly.
“I had an idea that this was a, prohibition neighbor-*

hood.”

~_“Isn’t'yourcname Ryan?” the constable demanded, I 
tentatiously thrusting a thumb in the armhole of 

vest and showing his badge of oﬂice, while he tilted  "ti

chair back and threw one leg over the other.
“No, my dear sir, it isn’t,” replied Ryan’ laughing}

“Neither. is it ]ones, or ‘Brown, or Plunkety-pltinlt

You’ve climbed the wrong tree.” ‘I - r E

‘ They had decided to keep on their way throughout that
clay, for nowthey were in a part of the country where
there was less danger of being stopped.
Their route lay along mountain roads, and frequently
’ . they were so steep as to tax the capacity of the Packard
“ ‘to the utmost. I ‘ ‘
By common consent they avoided larger towns, some-
‘ ' times making considerable détours to get around them.
, At two ill the afternoon they stopped in a bit of wood

CHAPTER VIII]
NICK CARTER TACKLES A PUZZLE.

 rather necessary now that we should return to
 Carter,'to view the case from the standpoint he was
obliged to assume.

 will be remembered that he was with Conroy Con-
er, the United States Secret Service agent, at the home
of his i'sister,iMrs. Baxter, in Eighty-third Street, and
that Chick, who had been wounded, required imrnediate

tterition as soon as he made his report of the capture of
yarn, .and(.sta‘ted‘ the fact that the latter was imprisoned
side ‘theiautomobile with Patsyon guard over him.

_ fut did not oecur to any of-them that Patsy would re-

.V.A1,1d so the two men, with"the assistance of Conner’s

 slight——fwas dressed; and then «Nick Carter and

he asked of his ‘chief assistant; and being‘ assured that. he . C;
was, the.three left the house together and lostno time ,

“Conner,” said Nick, when they arrived there and were.
seated in his study——for neither of them felt like sleeps ,

“I sure did, Nick; and only for that one ,mistake,-' in‘ -e “

Asrthe reader knows, it was nearly four o’clock the
following afternoon before Patsy posted his letter, which
‘had to go to Boston before it could be returned to Nick
‘ Carter, and consequently it was not until the second

 
  

 morning after the escape that the letter wasreceived in
 .New York. A _ , R
R During that time nothing was done in the way of ta-
ij king up the chase, save to warn policemen‘ and constables
 throughout the surrounding country to be on the lookout
 for the big Packard. ’ .
 It was a coincidence that almost simultaneously with
r the receipt of the letter came_ the information from the
; police that such an automobile had been found and taken.
A. It bore the license number, all right, but thereyseemed to
  a hitch about the affair somewhere, and would Nick
 Carter and the manager of the garage please look into
R’ the.‘ matter at once? ' a .3‘
It was, of course, the Packard of the same model as
i, that driven by Ryan, with which/he had, changed numbers
at in front of the Majestic. l c
The matter was iquickly adjusted, foryother manager of
f the garage knew the instant ‘he saw it that it. was not his
 machine that had been captured. '
;r ya a For reasons of his own, Nick saidcnothing about "the
letter he had 1."°—<3€i'Y<’-lti from Patsy, savetog Conn/er and

to tell them about Lydia, Patsy had to turn.his head to
control his own emotions, at the sorrow they felt in that
household. . ‘

To do Ryan justice, he maideia very simple tale of it
all; alstory of heart failure, resulting from inﬂuenza;
his own despair because of it all; his resolution to leave

3o,« NEW NICK CA

The same voyage the captain was caught with an aching

, ‘tooth, the pain‘, from gwhich soon became unbearable. The

remedy of the sailor had proved so much worse than the
disease that the captain was unwilling to try the chisel.

His contrivance for extracting the tooth was ingenious
though intricate. He fastenedfa ﬁne long wire to a ‘bullet,
which he placed in his pistol with the wire hanging out.
Securing the wire to the aching tooth, he opened his mouth
as wide as possible and ﬁred.

His ingenuity was rewarded, for the tooth followed the
bullet into the air. His experience, however, made him
buy.a set ofdentists’ instruments. But,, strange to relate,
he never had any use for them, though he ‘followed the sea
for _V many years. ‘ 4 S

Revengelis a desire that occupies a place in the hearts of

_ a great many convicts—revenge upon individuals who were
5'-7‘-instrumental in bringing about their present predicament,
revengeagainst society in general. In but few cases, how-
 ever, has revenge against individuals been executed in deed;
 inf most cases, it is but a sullen rumbling of. their feelings,
thatdies away and becomes extinct ‘after time and reﬂec—
 ‘tioin have weakened their memory——pictures of wrongs, real
or imaginary, perpetrated in connection with their convic-
Wtion for crime. A
that, while serving a sentence of seven years, he frequently
ruminated over the so-thought injustice of his conviction,
andgradually worked himselfinto a determination to take
revenge upon him who he maintained had accused him

f‘f'_ wrongly. His time expired, he left prison‘, sought his vic-«i

_ ’ tim, and wreaked hisiregvenge. For ‘this he was returned
_.  to prison‘ under sentence‘ of ten years. “I’ll "take the ten-

. spot,” he declared. “I’m not kicking; I’ve had my reveilge
“and” am satisﬁed.” Luckily men of such ferocious deter-
. mination arenot in great numbers; the most of them forget

M . their desire for revenge in time.

 

 The most common form employed in the carrying out of
,'the -death-sentence is, in all probability, the guillotine. It
 has been, until ‘recently, bniployed publiclyin France, Bel-
“giuin, Denmark, and two cantons in Switzerland. The gal-
lows cbmes next, and is favored ipubliclyvin Austria, Por-
tugal, and Russia, and partly in Great_Britain and America.
Death, by the sword obtains in ﬁfteen cantonsiin Switzerland,
China,;an.d Russia publicly, and in Prussia privately. Ecua-
dor,-‘Oldenburg, and Russia have adopted the musket, all
‘publicly. In Turkey, they have strangulation by the cord,
and in Spain the garrote, both public, and ‘in Brunswick
death by the ax. In some States of our ,,own country crim-
'inals: under the death-sentence are executedby electricity.

I would like to ask "a few questions.
them in your weekly?

1. _Which do you think the better, a Colt or Smith &
Wesson revolver, and is a Colt automatic pistol as accurate
as a revolver of same make? ‘ V

2. I always understood that V\7ii1chester riﬂes had more .
velocity and penetration than any other, but that Remington
riﬂes were more accurate. Is this true, and, if not, which is
the better..of the two?, ' . ‘-

3. Dogs, firearms, and dogs, are my long suit._ Can you“
tell me if the mastiff is the largest breed of dogs known?)
I would like to get one of the largest and most intelligent .,
breeds known.’ Do you know of ‘a kennel that breed such
dogs? T " *

Please do me the favor to answer these questions.

Very truly, AN ADMIRER on THE “LITTLE GIANT.” ‘

Would you answer

All the guns you mention are ﬁne, and you can include the T
Marlin with the lot. We would not like toanswer your _
question about revolvers, since each make has"'its ‘advocates, 
and our opinion might be biased from an acquaintance with‘
