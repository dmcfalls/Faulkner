silently into the ﬁrelight, and stood there with folded
arms, regarding him; and then it was that 'iorié'”of the
greatest surprises of Nick Carter’s life came to- him.

"It is Sindahr!” he heard one of them exclaim to the

‘other. in Hindustani. _ _

» . Once before that night, although in utter darkness, he
had been mistaken for the man who was called Sindahr.
That time it had been his voice wl‘ch had given rise to
the mistake; but now he had ‘not poken a word, and
therefore it followed that, in the faint light of the em-

bers, he somehow looked like Sindahr.

i It was an accident, of course,,‘for he had never seen
the man for whom he was mistaken; the man of whom
he now knew, since Jahx-a’s speeclnto have been the
one who aided‘in the abduction of Rena from the palace.

I c He recalled instantly the fact that his voice had already

l/dec_e_ived one man into the belief that he was Sindahr, and
that, "therefore, it might be expected to serve the same
purpose again.’ He resolved, to risk it «when, the moment
should come for him to speak. V

There was silence for several moments; evidently they
were waiting for him to say‘ something, to them, but he

 did not:accept the invitation. He also remained silent; H i

h At’ last one‘of them—-—the eldest and tallest man ofvthe

three--addressed him, but with such anevidence of »pro-
fffound respectithat Nick at once concluded that Sindahr
i must be a man of considerable authority, among them.
