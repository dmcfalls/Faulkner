THE LITTLE WIZARD

on, THE success or‘ A YOUNG INVENTOR

CHAPTER I.é—The Little Wizard.

(‘Upon my word, Fred, you're a wonderlf e1ac-
ulated Bob I_.arkins_ in a tone of admiration. “I
don't wonder the people of this village call_ you
-the Little Wizard. By George! You are ayizard

. ,  fqrrgetting up schemes that pan out results. ”

. . ‘~,‘ hank you for your commendation, Bob, re-
plied Fred with a gratiﬁed look on his handsome,
sunburned countenance. “A fellow . cant help

feeling pleased when he sees that his ideas are
appreciated‘ by others.” ‘ _ . '4'
“How the dickens do you manage to think of all
these things ’ you have invented? Your head
doesn’t seem to be shaped a whole lot different

from mine, and, yetyou are able to dig out of ,

it ’most anything you want.” ‘ . ,
“Oh, the ideas come to me one way or another
V Wvithout any effort on my part, and in any old
 place,” replied Fred. “Sometimes one strikes me
 at night after I've turned in and settled down to
go to sleep. It comes just like a ﬂash—-a kind of
; -ins iration-—and I‘.jump up, go_ to my writing-
,;¥ tab e and jot the thing down as It‘ unfolds before
, . my mental vision. Then in the morning all I have
-if to do is to read my notesover and it ‘all comes
back to me. If I didn’t catch it on the ﬂy, as it
were, and make those notes, I’d never be able to
_ remember enough about it when I Woke up to
 ‘ vainount to shucks.” I 
' c 9 “’Most everything you’ve turned out has been
so blamed simple that I’ve wondered why they
haven”: all been thought of a hundred times be-
: fore and turned to practical use. Look at that
burglar-proof window device o-.f*your‘s, a half in-
terest in which you had to give to Squire Parker to

 

 , get the money to patent it. The*Gale Manufactur-

knock the spots out of the more expensive. devices. - .

for a similar purpose on the market. The Gale. 

Company is putting them out at a nickel for a set

of four, and I'll bet*is coining money out of them.” ,

" Fred laughed.

“It was so simple that when I showed the sam-
ples to Squire Parker he gave me the laugh. He
didn’t laugh, though, when I had given him a.
practical demonstration of their utility. He
thought it over a‘- little while and then agreed to
patent it in my name for :1 half interest. Of
course I consented, for I couldn’t raise $75 to save
my life. As soon as the patent was applied for

somebody connected with a certain publication in I

New York that is widely circulated among people
interested in patents and mechanical problems
printed a description of the device with an illus-
tration of the wedge, and in a short time I hadvthe
offer from the»Gale Company for the exclusive
rights.‘ The squire advised me to close with the
company, and I did."  Z
“That was certainly the simplest of all your

schemes, but none of them is the least bit compii-\ ,

cated. Aren't you going to have the rest of them

patented ‘.7 Of course you’ll do that with this new-

fangled combination knife of yours." ,

“I may have one or'two' of them patented later
on," replied Fred. “It doesn't follow because they
look like good schemes that they'll take on the

market. ‘That is something that must be consid-  ’

ered. No use of wastin
it is offered to the pub ‘c falls as ﬂat as a- pan-
cake, I’ve been told that only ahout one patent
in a hundred is worth putting out. 'I’m going to
apply for a patent on this combination knife right

- away, and I don't imagine it will be necessary. for’ ._ 

me to sell a half interest in it either, to raise the ., ‘ t

,p'rice..” _ l "g  
“I should say not,” answered Bob. “You ought to

$75 on\a device that after

make a good thing out of it. Perhaps the Gale »

Company will take it off your hands at a good  '

)1

chance-...; Thegmanager told .me n the fpapeis

“Then I consider this device as good as sold, for
in. my opinion it is bound to take. Sixteen useful
tools combined in one is a corker, all right, and it’s

. so simple that it’ll cost hardly anything to manu-
facture.”

“That is the important consideration, Bob. These
things have got to be sold cheap, andgat a profit

,to manufacturer, middle man and dealer, or what’s
the use of‘ getting them,.out? The ﬁve ‘and ten
cent stores of the big cities are the rage now.
Everybody goes to them for something, of this
kind. That means that ten cents is the limit if you
want to secure large sales and introduce the goods
widely. Under such circumstances the proﬁt can

- be small to the manufacturer and still make'money
for him. See the point?” I T
- llSuI.e'!5 . ' _ ‘ V

“Now, the framework of this combination knife
can be cut out of a piece of metal and shaped at
thesame time. The adjustable slide will have to be

unched out separately and ﬁited in place by hand;
ut" that can be done by a kid in no» time The
knife—blade will also have to be sharpened by hand.
‘- A skilled hand can do that very quiclﬂy, as the
metal is thin. When in use a fine ﬂat ﬁle will keep
the blades always sharp. The pointed scoop at the
end of the handle is intended to remove the cores
from apples, pears, and such. It will also take the
eyes out of potatoes, pineapples, and so on. The-
top, or broad. end of the knife, is intended for a
chopperand scra per. It will scale ‘ﬁsh very hand-
ily. The ‘blade with the adjustable slide may be
used foiﬁcuttiing ‘cabbage, or kraut, or slaw; for
slicing ‘potatoes in di erent shapes or paring
pineapples, sweet potatoes, carrots;Vparsni s or

_ turnips, and so forth. The implement wil ac-
complish at least twodozen‘ uses that I know of,

r and I have no doubt

1 time I have got it patented.” ’

' “I’ve heard of" several kinds of vegetable and
fruit parers and corers, but nothing that will do

. - so»,many things as yours. Are. you sure there isn't

V anything like it on the market_?’.’ , ' » . T

 “I’ve secured a list of every practical device on
this line from the patent ﬁrmin Washington that‘

. .put through my burglar-proof invention, and I

‘ﬁnd that this idea will not infringe on any other

patent,” replied Fred. V

«~ “Then,you’re all right.‘ .Say, how came you to

' think up such a_‘('.0IYlblI18.tl0Tl tool?” V V
'. _ ' “This evolved itself by degrees. It didnot come

' ’ all ‘T at once like some‘ of the other schemes. I
thought of the knife with the adjustable slide first

, andnthen I added the other improvements after-

wards.” -, T - 3' r. ‘

“Well, you’re,a colikér, Fred. Some day you’ll

make your fortune out of some ridiculously simple .
" devicethat people whemthey see it will wonder "

'~ they never thought of such it thing themselves.”

He lived in one of the small cottages the con-,
tractors had built to‘ house their workmen, and the
domestic arrangenients were looked after byan old
woman’ of sinister, aspect, assisted by a very
pretty but poorly dressed girl of seventeen years. ‘

’ who was known as Sculiy’s niece. —

The girl, whose name was known to be Jessie,
was seldom seen outside the whitewashed fence
surrounding the cottage, and then always in. the
elderly woman’s company. . , , V

She made no friends, for any advances on the
part of. the _other workmen"s wives,-ma daughters
were discouraged by the old harridan. who ruled J ‘;.
the roost while Scully was away, and he was away 
the greater p of his time, for after supper he . '
invariably sought the society of-_a few kindred
spirits in a roadside tavern that bore an= unsavory
reputation in the village. ' . . 1

He usually returned home around midnight more
or less; loaded, and as ,a consequence often turned
uplate at his job. . H ' . ,,

v_ As part of Fred Knowles’ duty was to act as
time-keeper, and keep tabs on the men, he was
frequently obligtsl to dock Scully for lost time. .

Scully resented this, and by degrees" nursed a . ~
strong resentment against the boy.

having little money to squander on liquor, found; "

it to his interest to keep in with the bricklayer, .‘

“They, say his window clutch does the trick all
right,” replied Yarnold. “He couldn’t have sold the
patent if it wasn’t some good.”

“What is the thing, and how does it operate?"

Yarnold explained the simplicity and effective- ‘

ness of the device. — - _
“Ho!” sniffed Scully. “I don't think nothin’ of

that. S’pose Iwanted to get mat a window where
them things were used, do you know how I'd get

‘‘That’s just what I thought of,” replied Yarnold.
“Well, what’s this scheme you were goin’ to tell
;me ‘.7’,

. ” , “I saw somethin’ in the ‘Standard’ about a new

invention of his which the editor said was goin’
to be one of the greatest labor-savin’ devices ever
used by women in the kitchen.” ‘ ‘
“What of it?” asked Scully impatiently.
. “Well-,,you see he ain’t made no application for a
patent on it yet. I was thinkin’ if you and me
’ could manage to get into his room when he was
out or asleep and steal the model, we could sell ’it
to somebody and make good, money out of it. _ We
could both get square with him that way’ and
make a bunch of coin at the same time.”
‘ The prospect of securing a wad of money ap-
pealed more to Scully than even the thought of
revenge. ~ . .
“Do you think we could, do it?”.He said eagerly.
“I'm sure we could,” replied his companion. “His
room is on the second ﬂoor in the rear of the house
overlookin’ the kitchen addition, which is one
 story; There wouldn’t be no‘ trouble climbin’ on to
the roof of the kitchen, and that would brin us
right under his window. As I figger. he’s got tliem
attached to his sashes, why, we must go provided

 with a glazier’s diamond -to cut out one of. the

panes; When we get into’ the’ room we’ll do e him
with a rag soaked with chloroform. That’l make

~ ’ him sleep sound enough, _I’ll warrant. Then we

can hunt for that model without fear of interrup-
tion.” “When do you think. of workin’ the job?”
 “Some night next week. The sooner we-do it
the better, I reckon.” ~

‘ ‘.‘I’m with you, Yarnold. I’m willin’ to take some
chances to get revenge on, that chap, and doin’

, [him out of his invention, which you think we can

sell for a good price, strikes me as-justabout the
cri-ghtway of i’eachin’ him to our own advantage.”
_“There ain’t nobetter way that I know of. I

CHAPTER III.—Saved by a‘ Girl ,

“Fred,” said Mr. Baldwin, who was head man in he .
charge at the. unﬁnished factory building at Green- .

lawn, under the junior partner of the firm, “Mr;

Jellicot has just arrived and wants to see you -in ‘T

hisroom.” .

It was nine o’clock Monday morning and work 

on the. building had been in full blast for anhour.
“All right, sir,” said the boy, and h_e started

for theinner office, where he found the junior’

partner and one of his assistants standing by a

long table covered with blue prints and, speciﬁca- ‘T '

tions. '- . ,

Fred saw that.Mr. Jellicot was busy explain-
ing something to the young man alongside of him,
so he waited by one of the windows until his

boss was at liberty to talk with him. .;From the-' V

window the boy had a good View of the big
chimney in process of erection at‘ the river end
of the factory. _ It was surrounded by a maze of
scaffold-in-g, and on the‘ top platform two men
were busily en aged in laying bi-icks,_while two
more men coul '
a platform below each with a hod of mortar over

uated on the Toledo river-front. He took me from
the school, brought me down to his lodging-house,
-placed me under the eye of the horrible old woman
who lives with us now at the cottage, and forced
me to go to work in a factory. That was five’
years ago, when I was only twelve years old.’,’ ,
“My gracious!” ejaculated Fred, clenching, his‘
ﬁsts as if he would liked to have had it out with
Scully in the girl’s behalf. I
“Things became worse and worse with Mr;
Scully,\and so they became worsewith me,” con-
tinued Jessie. “The lodging-house Went to ruin
by degrees ‘as such custom as Mr.‘ Scully had fell
away. On account, of free ﬁghts/there and-for
other reasons the place was raided by'the police
several times, but the old woinangwhose name
is Meiggs, managed to carry me off into an ad-
joining house, and I was saved the added disgrace ,
of being taken into a police court, a prisoner.‘
‘Although arrested a number of times, and more .
than once on a serious charge, Mr. Scully always
managed to get discharged through the inter-  —-
vention of a. lawyer named Noah‘ Parsons, who-
is even a greater villain in my opinion than he is.

“Yes, I know what a political pull is,” nodded
Fred. “Go on.” V "
‘‘'That’s how I have spent the last ﬁve years of ,
my life," went on the girl in tearful tones. ‘Three J .'
. months ago a man was stabbed in the lodging- ‘
house. Mr. Scully maintains that Noah Parsons -
did the job, for he was frequently at our place,
and I believe was ha,nd-in-glovewith, my uncle,

self from suspicion the lawyer induced ‘Mr.-Scully,
to leave Toledo that night. His object no doubt ,
was to_ make it appear that my. uncle, whose?
reputation with the police is had,’ was the guilty

go contrary to the lawyer’s wishes, so he left.',

His appeal was not without its effect. She had

her was irresistible. i She rose mechanically, held

That was a problem that nonplussed the plucky

sport. As the boat in which Fred sat in discon-

several boys perched upon the remains of a ‘small
wharf close to the river with their «lines in the
water. ,

He was close enough to the bank to recognize
one of them as his friend Larkins. Spginging to
his feet he shouted: “Hi! hi! hi! Bob! Oh, Bob!”
Bob ‘and the other boys looked in the direction .of
the hail and they saw the Little Wizard in the
boat, ﬂoating down the stream.

“Hello, Fred! ‘That you?”
“Where, are you going?” : ,

“Nowhere. ,I’m adrift without oars. Can't you

Mr. Baldwin at once left the room. An hour

hesitation ‘he admitted that he had seen Scully
push Fred off.

CHAPTER VII.——The Stolen Invention.

, ‘When Constable Tibbetts »reached the Sc_ully
cottage with his warrant he found the place lock:
' ed up. There‘were no signs of the three persons

he wanted anywhere around: He made inquiries '

‘of the neighbors and learned, that Scully, his
. niece, and Mrs. Meiggs had gone away in a bunch
’ aboutrhalf an hour before in a_ lightzwagon.
,, driven by Moses Yarnold, ~with;,two,,~t:1fun1<.s and
two grips, as if bound on some trip. '« '
There was a railroad station at Cloverdale on
the M. & Q, trunk line, ten miles away'to the
' north. Thisroad went direct to Toledo in ‘the
"east and,F'ort Wayne and other points to the
west. Instead of going to Cloverdale, the Scully
I’ crowd could have driven tovA‘rdshy, four miles
 south on the river and there taken -the A. & ‘P.
’ short; line to Piedmont, on the Maumee River,
where they could’ connect ‘with a boat of the
Maumee Navigation Company either for Toledo
oneway or ~- Fort Wayne the other,’ or inter-
m.ediate,townfs'on the river.‘ - , .» , c
It was also’ possible for them to take the M.

THE LITTLE WIZARD '

Constable Tibbetts next «tried to.

Squire Parkerls office, where‘;

.5pa,i‘(§;l_'li’.l'y for. good, [abandoning _‘their furniture, AV

1 which had been bought‘ _on_cred1t at one of the

vill" ‘ e ‘stores.‘gI1‘i7ed was not only diS5PpQ1‘1'1ted‘v0n V
' oirt, ~but‘- giveatlyv

consulted Squire Parker as to ‘what could be ‘ i
done in the ,_matter. ‘ _ , _ .

The squire said nothing could be done at pres-,
ent. He hoped the police at Piedmont would
catch the fugitives at that point. If they failed

then it was impossible to say whither Scully and ’ “'1

the two «females had gone. ,Fred would.have-
suggested Toledo. only that Jessie had given him
to understand 'that~Scully waswanted by the
authorities of that city for the stabbing affair,

so it washardly likely that. he would return to ‘

his old stamping grounds asthirlgs stood. V ~

The boy would have understood diﬁferently if he
could have known that Scully had found a letter‘
from Lawyer Parsons, of Toledo, at the cottage
when he got there after leaving the works, in;
forming him that he (Parsons) had squared things
for him and he could returnin perfect safety.

Scully, therefore, having no further use for
Greehlawn, and looking for ‘trouble in connection’ V
with_his attempt'on ‘the Little-Wizard’s life, -had ~
hurriedly arranged for immediate departure from ,.
the village, Yarnold agreeing to borrow a wagon.  1
and take his party, bag and baggage, to Ardsley. V
. _He was thus obliged to give up his connection
witli'the sche e proposed by Yar'nold~to steal-
Fred’s latest inv ntion., ’ ~ V ,. '

‘Yarnold under these circumstances decided to
work the job alone, if he could manage it, and;
pocket all the proﬁt that might resultfif he was
successful. ’ ,' ’ p. g _ ‘ 7 , ' “ .

Next morning Fred learned that the police‘ of = 
Piedmont had failed to capture Scully and his com- '
panions, and he felt quite broken up over it.’ . ~,

“It<_makes me wild to think that Jessie Drum-w .
mend is still at the mercyiof that rascal and the 
old, hag,” he said to himself as he made his way to ~ ‘
the works. “The poor girl must feel dreadfully dis- » ~ '
V couraged to think she was so close to a, new hap y - 

life, and then to have the chance snatched away by 1
her tyrants. If I only had the’ mone
detective I- might be able to get a
whereabouts, and set the.1aw
rescue.” , i V L , -. _

Fred ‘was so exercised about Jessie’s fate that , ,
he neglected -his combination knifeinvention he , «
was 9. out to, havepatented. I  * ' . ‘ ’ ;_
’ He had written about it to the patent,l.awy_e‘rs‘in' ‘ ".

In the meantime Fred Knowles was following‘

Mother -Meiggs along -the _river;fron_t, and the old
hag never dreamed that she was beingshadowedl

‘ She kept straight on at a shuffling gait that spoke

off the wharf. ~ ~

_“I’m ‘afraid my sudden appearance is going to?

give him a shock,” chuckled Fred, picturing the
rascals surprise and consternation on ﬁnding
himself outwitted. He started after Yarnold,
but at that moment a transfer wagon drove be-
tween him and the object of his pursuit, and he
‘had to walk around it, only to find another team’
in'his road. By the time he had extricated him;
self Yarnold had got out of ‘his sight. _
Fred was mad’ enough to chew a tenpenny nail.
Looking up and down the thoroughfare he ﬁnally
saw_Yarnold half a block ahead on the other side
of the way, walking ‘north. I That was the direc-
tion in which the “l\_dariiiers" Sung Harbor” lay.
Fred chased after him at gay rapid pace, ,e:<pcct-
ing to see him turn up one of the streets that
ended at the brivelr tlioroughiare. Y _ Id Ik
He didn’t, ut opt straig t on. arno» wa -
.ed fast, and Fred closed slowly with him, as he
didn't want to run. Fred was so interested in
the pursuit that he didn’t notice he ‘had got back

, to the vicinity of Scull/y’s lodging-house until
i Yarnold suddenly cut across the street and: en-

tered the main doorway ofithe “ll/Iari;ners’ Snug

Harbor.” Fred pulled up and looked blankly at

the swing door.

"Blessed if he hasn’t gone in there!” he
“That means he probably intends to
take counsel with Scully. He did the rascal
several turns in Greenlawn, and now maybe he
want.-;.'Scully to reciprocate. This rather com-

Ilcates matters. I wonder what.._.tinr_ie it is?”

e clock of a near-by beer saloon indicated that
the hour was ﬁve. Fred was at a loss what

i ’- move to make next.

He’ was afraid he would attract attention if he
openly hung around the neighborhood, so he
entcgrsd a dirty, ill-smelling entry nearly opposite
Scii1ly’s establishment, and from the shadow of
thedoor he watched for Yarnold to come out. The

V4 jday,-which was a cloudy one, seemed to grow.

gloomier as evening drew near. - ,

Pale-looking gas jets began to ﬂicker in the
saloons and tenement houses within range of
Fred’s vision, and it was ’tting quite dark _by

knowing how long Yarnold and Scully were going‘
to remain below he got a hustle on.
the room they had left he found a lamp» dimly
burning on a table. This was the room‘ in which
Scully and Parsons hadiheld their interview that
afternoon.’ Fred looked hastily around for Yarn-
o1d’s grip and s_aw'it standing in a corner.

“I’1l have to cut‘it open,” he said,’ feeling for l

his knife. Pulling the grip toward him his heart
gave a jump when he saw the key in the lock. To
open it was the work of a moment. His small
ﬂat model ‘and the roll which he believed con-
tained his drawings and ‘description were right on’
top of a lot of wearing apparel. , _ i

Opening the roll to make sure he found he was
right in his conjecture. Making a ﬂat package of
the two papers he shoved them with the model

into his pocket, with a chuckle‘ of triumph, re- 

locked the rip and returned it to the corner.
“Now to eave the building, get my supper and
then see the, police about Jessie,” said Fred to‘
himself. “It isn’t»safe for me to imonkey around
this crib any longer.” He opened the door to
go when he heard the footsteps and the voices

of Scully and Yarnold c‘om'g1g up the stairs.‘ He "

was about, to dartinto the dark landing when he
saw a light coming down» the staircase from
above, and a second looked showed -him,the out-

and he realized he was avprisoner. ' .

THE LITTLE WIZARD

Fred"-could hear him and_ Mother Meiggs talking
together and moving things about. The Little

“ .‘ Wizard found on investigation that _he couldn’t
get out of the closet v_vithout.breaking a panel

out of the door. .

Nearly an hour passed before ‘he heard Seully
go downstairs. Mother Meiggs, however, re-
inainéd, and Fred waited impatiently for her to

' ’ go back upstairs. She appeared to be in no hurry,

and seemed ‘to be busy over something. As a

rmattei‘ of factgshe was packing Scully’s trunk

for the morning_ departure. ‘Scully had, gone,
downstairs to relieve his assistant, ‘Dick Fitch,

from duty. _ _ .
As there was no one in the public room at the

I time he took his seat‘ at the table in the rear

corner of the room under the gla:/led Window and
proceeded to.read the evening aper. As the
clock pointed to the hour of eig t, a well-built;
heavily-bearded stranger‘ of middle_age entelfed
the room. He had a bluff, breery air about him;
and a certain rolling gait that indicated a close
connection with the sea, though he was dressed
in a new suit of shore togs. The stranger walk-

Ved down the room‘, and Scully hearing his foot-

steps, looked up.

“Sure,” replied Scully, hardly knowing what
he said. ,,

“You must have laid out a lot on her, Dan,“
said the captain, ‘his heart warming tbward the
rascal. “I didn't leave you more’n half ‘enough
to meet the expense you’ve been put to. ‘But then

“You can’t see her to-night, Nat,i’ said Scully,
hastily. “The school is out of town some distance.

on being-_aboard the steamboat with Jessie, bound

individual was Noah Parsons, the rascally lawyer.
While approacliing the “Mariners? Snug Harbor” ;
a little while beforehe had obsei-ved,a man ahead-..
of himiwho seemed to be astranger to the neigh- . ~
borhood. When he saw this man stop in front of ‘
Dan Scu1ly’s establishment, andafter gazing at
it in a puzzled kind of way enter the public room,
he‘ jumped. to the ‘correct conclusion that the ,,;i,. ‘
stranger was the expectedcaptain Drummond.‘ ‘  ‘
Glancing in at the front door he saw the eetu _ :2.
ing between, Dan and’ the father of Jessie, and 5
observed that they presently got iiito conversation?
at the table. Noah Parsons immediately felt A

 

about, and beingva sneaky individual, by nature,
he lost no time ‘in entering the house unobserved,

from the closet. Without wasting a moment he

,of. the staircase his escape was cut off by the
entry of Noah Parsons through the.side door, as

.'we have seen.

V g ﬂeeting that the intruder would go upstairs; but
. e_ didi-i’t.' He followed Fred, unconscious of his
presence, and the boy, squeezing himself into a

' corner nearthe back door, hardly hoped to avbid
discovery. The rascally lawyer, however, was in-

'.,tent on overhearing what was passing between
Scully and Captain -Drummond, and did not sus-
pect the presence of any one in the entry.

Fred, with bated breath, watched him open
the little window and stand in a. listening atti-
tude,-all the while wondering what his game was.
After muttering his thoughts aloud Parsons went
to the door opening on. the public room, stuck

him. Excusing himself to the captain, Dan walk-

' ‘ CHAPTER XiV.—what Jessie sawin‘

the
Public Room. ' V

* Now that Fred found himself alone and face
to face’ with his fate he did, not waste any of his
precious moments‘ of his allotted span of lifein
worrying over his desperate and apparently hope-

‘ Lless situation, butresorted to instant action in

the endeavor to outwit his enemies and, save_his
‘own life. There is an ancient saying, the ground-
work qf one of Aesop’s ,fables, that ~“I-Ieaven helps
.those who help themselves,” and Fred, though he
had never heard -of it, proceeded to put it into
‘practice.-* ‘ - " ' '

He had no i
-the murderous designs of -the two Scoundrels in
the building above his head. So he began a strug-

gle with theirbonds that lieldfhim. a prisoner to '

the cross—beani. In his first. efforts to free his

handsfrom the line he. cut his ﬁngers on the sharp;

shells of a’ ‘bunch of mussels he was lying on.

1 While resting for a few minutes the smarting of

the cut i ut an idea into his head. He determined
.to seeﬂi he could fray the-~rop across the shells.
While he was thus engaged Dan Scully was mix-
‘wing a,.hp‘t'drink..at the bar for Captain Drummond,
who hadannounced his intention of returning<'to

his hotel, there to Await Dan’s appearance in_the-

ifmorning with a buggy to»take , him to the im-

aginary boar_ding—school where he supposed» his

daughter Jessie wasﬁriishing her education.

31 Into the hot drink Scullytiput a sufficient quan-‘

tity of chloral, or “knock-out drops,” to paralyze
-the honest skipper’s faculties. Noah Parsons
stood by the little windowlopening intothe entry

like a stone from a catapult. His temple came ; .

he fell 'to.the ﬂoor like a log, rolled over and lay

~_ At that tense moment the side door was thrown -
open and Fred, wet, with bleeding hands and dis- i

cry he sprang uponthe lawyer, seized the wrist -

Parsons turned upon‘ him he struck the rascal with f H
his left a ;blow in the face that caused.h-im ‘to
loosen his grasp’ on Jessie and fall',to the ﬂoor.
“Fred Knowles!” screamed the half-fainting .-
girl as he caught her in his arms and placed his ’

lawyer's ﬁngers. Parsons sprang up ‘like a mad-

of baffled fury the lawyer dashed from the room

, through the side door, made for the back entrance

' of the entry, ran down the steps to the boat, cast
off the rope and, seizing the oars pushed off into
the river. As the policemen advanced into the
room Fred faced them while Jessie threw her
arms‘ around the unconsciousmvcaptain she now
‘knew'to be her father, and begged him to look
up‘ and speak. to her. '

“W_hat’s the trouble here?” demanded the fore-‘

most oﬁicer. “Looks as if there has been murder
done,” as his eyes rested a momcnton the sense-
" less’ Captain Drummond and then took in the mo-
tionless‘ form of Scully, bleeding from the cut over
his Jzemple made by the sharp corner of the pool

table. “See if that man is dead, Barney," he said
to‘his companion. “Stand back there!” he added
to the ‘crowd.

Dead as a coffin-nail,_” replied Barney, after
an examination of Jessie’s uncle. “It’s Scully,

are you?” asked the captain. “What you've be’n
through ain't turned your Head, has it? Folks
generally has two names, ‘less they're Injuns.”

“I thought I had a name till tonight,” said Clif,
bitterly, realizing that the truth must be told, “but
I have not. I am nameless, a nobody, and have
been turned away from the only home I have ever —
known._ You may call me Clif if you like, but I V
shall’ never take any other name till I have made
one.

“That's pretty tough, old feller," said the cap-
tain, kindly.‘ “But don't you worry. If you're as
good a sailor as you say you are, and I guess you
are, by the way you sailed that ,-little boat a night

make yourself to home. When you want to turn
in, young lady, Jack’1l show you your room. You
are all pretty well, used up, I guess, and you bet-

what particular'line the vessel was in that her
captain could promise him plenty of , money; but‘

.r he was worn out now, and gave up thinking , ’

about it until a more convenient o’ccasivon..
An hour later, when he and Tom were alone in

and sleet from his sou—wester and said: - ;
“So,you’ve been turned outof the house. eh?” . '
“Yes, and told ‘that I was a foundling, a nobody
and hadn't even a name.”

“No; but you’d better get some coffee ready for

Then the men’ll want some, I reckon.” .

The man went on deck and Clif said: _ ,

ishness afore long, and like the life" fust-rate,

At that gnoment there ..yvas a whistle on deck,

The scientists succeeded in transmitting from
one end of thelaboratory to the other images of
a. moving ﬁnger as well as of several small ob:

Professor Belin and his partner are conﬁdent
that within a few monthsthey will have solved
satisfactorily the problems of televsion, so that
atone end of a telephone the subscriber will be
able to see the person to whom he is talking.

The method used is a combination of mechan-
ics and electricity based on the use of electrons. ‘
which permit the transmission of images or parts
of images in a time "shorter than the duration of
a retinal impression, which is the sixteenth art
of a second. In sending‘ a photoelectric cel in-

An Unlucky Raid

In the good old days of the Bow street runners,
when highway assaults were rife, and solitary
postchaise travelers ‘never journeyed without.pis-

tols in their pockets, and tremor at their hearts;’

when strange feats in the ‘shape of starlight rob-

beries were boasted of, /and a “Knight of the

Road” aspired to be called a gentleman, the fol-

lowing incident occurred:

One afternoon in early autumn, close upon sun-
set, a couple of well-dressed men, driving a light

‘gig, in which was a poor jaded-lookin horse,
~ stopped at a wayside posting—inn, not a undred
miles from Bath, and requested accommodation
for the night. They were fashionably attired, and
spoke in condescending tones to. the landlord and
servants, using afew words now and again of
town slang, as young-’bucks of the first water
were proud to do ingthat way. V .

Giving the horse-“and gig over to the care of
the hostler, they adjoined to» the public room, and
called for some light refreshments in the shape
of idrink,_ordering a supper to be servedrvlater.
The landlord» hunself brought in the~brandy.-a.nd-
water. ' ‘

“What’s this story about a great highway rob-
bery near here last night, landlord'.”’- questioned
one. “We heard of it on the road, coming along.
Is it true?’’.' ‘

“Quite tr e, sir. Ah’, gentlemen, it is a dread-
ful thing—t ou

home across the heath an, hour or two after mid-
night, having been to a ball, when the carriage
was stopped by four mounted. horsemen with
cocked pistols. The lady screamed and fainted,
_the young ones screamed and kicked, and the
gentlemen, those audacious robbers, proceeded
politely to riﬂe the ladies of every ornament they
. ‘ wore.” . ' '

“Scoundrels!” interjected one of the uests.
“More than that, your worships. W at should

"tread a measure with them! It was a ﬁne night,
, as you may perhaps remember, sirs—the moon-

beams shining bright on the bare heath. Out of
the coach they handed them, and footed it in a
minuet; dancing, it’s said, to perfection, as though
they were used to lead out the king’s own daugh-

undid was the one that had the valuable horse

‘lock it, was. Then, while the other man ke t
i-watch, he hastily and noiselessly attached t e
_horse»to their own gig, using the harness he had
‘ ired so greatly. The rain was dashing down
smartly, which tended to deaden other sounds.

“What the deuce is the. matter with him?” de-
manded Wade. ‘ -

“Be shot if I know. He seemsdead beat. It’s
so dark one can see nothing. Wish that they

“Well, this is a pretty go!” exclaimed the other, I

fused to move. “Brought up, before’ one’s half,
beyond danger, with a stolen horse! You must
have been mistaken in the worth of the animal, '
Jim; never knew you to mistake one before.” ~'

“It beats me hallow,” returned Jim, his crest-

‘fallen tone ‘betraying “me alarm. “As to bc-in _

Something extraordinary must ail the horse.”

He jumped out of the gig and began feeling the
animal with his hands. At the same moment the
coy moon burst out from behind the clouds and
shone in all her splendor. Jim felt the horse,»
stared at it, and stared again. The other in the‘,
gig was also gazing curiously. Simultaneously‘ 8

from both of them. 1 ‘

They had stolen their own horse! , 3

Some mutual recrimination ensued—'—Wade ac-

the wrong stable; Jim vowing by all that's blue
that he had opened the right one. “ .

light. A closer glance, and then another angry
shout burst from him. - :

“Look here, you fool! Here’s a ‘cres];_.”’

“Hey—what?” cried Jim, turnin around.

Sure enough. The silver—mount harness bore
a family crest with its Latin. motto, and could,
no doubt, be identiﬁed anywhere. Certainly this-

Next morning th landlord of the inn was in- .

about here last night under cover 0’ the ‘dusk,

MONEY; .Ul.TRA-VIOLET RAY_s V EX-
’ . POSE OTHER FRAUDS '- » V v
A new development inthe quartz lamp, which’
makes _it possible to distinguish immediately be-
tween animal and mineral matter, was demon-

strated recently by its manufacturers.

The new lamp will give merchants. a quick and

,. sure means ofidistinguishing real pearls from

‘ those. of synthetic manufacture, and will enable

them to detect cotton threads in supposedly all-
wool cloths.

Counterfeit stocks, bonds and paper moneys can

be distinguished from genuine ones by the aid of
this light, for the slightestﬂiﬁerence in, the com-

_ position of the paper shows in a difference of color - ‘
‘under the ultra-violet light. Erasures or changes;

are.'also»clearly detectable.
The lamp ‘test isialso-applicable to oils, since

those manufactured from ‘animal fats or vegeta-2

bles give off a ﬂuorescence, while‘ oils of mineral
extraction retain a lifeless color. , ’
From a cultural standpoint the lamp also'holds
out hope that a multitude of manuscripts written
on parchment may now be deciphered. Since
parchménts are of animal origin and the stylus

is and ﬂuids with which the;writing wasdone were 2;
made from minerals, the chemical actjon resulting

is still discernible. under the] light, even. though

the ﬁrst writings were erased with ‘pumice-stone"

_‘;to allow the parchment to be used a second time.
