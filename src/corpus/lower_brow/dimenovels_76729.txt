L They left the treasure-chamber, and Patsy carLLe- L
fully locked the close—ﬁtting door Lbehind him.

He was not surprised in ﬁnding the‘ trap-door at l‘
the head of the stone steps not only unlocl-ted Lbut
wide open. L L L LL 1

He first carefully and Lnoiselessly ascended alone.
After peering around above, he motioned to Miss Al—
len to come up also. ‘They found themselves in a,
cellar such as is under mostcountry houses. L L

There were numerous bins for vegetables and fruit 

, built around the sides, and the trap through which

they_ enierged was part of the floor of one of these
bins. A quaiitityof straw lay on one side, which was L
evidently ‘scattered over thewell-ﬁtted trap‘ when it
was closed, and was brushed aside whenever it was in
use. ‘ A V l A
From this cellarthey hadno trouble in ascending L L
to the living part of the house, but Patsy used great‘ ’: l_

gaiiition as he proceeded.‘

L L A very little investigation convginced him that his '

liastily-fortmed theory expressedin the suhcellar to .

LMiss Allen had been correct. The house‘ wasL'dLe-

serted. , ﬁt . V k V p L. _,
. Undoubtedly the negress had been left in charge, ti I".L;.

and had been unfaithful-to her trust.

The coast was apparently clear, and the quicker, lie‘ L, 
could get Miss Allen to a place of safety the better he  
would feel satisﬁed, Then. he would turn his atte"n.-«L L
tioii to this houseof mys-teryLaLnd its rascally iiirnates; , L

‘ Amateur Detective 

Boys, in reading one of the Nick Carter stories

did you ever try to think ahead and guess whowas

_Each of the readers has a chanceto find out how good a detective he

7‘ He has the facts of the case laid before him just as Nick Carter himself has.
, Of course, he has not got Nick’s experience or wonderful detective instinct. ‘ ‘
or not he is a good detective by trying to decide in his own mind what the solution of the mystery is before; hej

has read to the end of the story. The earlier in the story he is able to make hisguess and the more A accurate it is

the better detective he is. .

We want to see what sort of detectives the readers or the NICK CARTER \VEEKLY;are. V V M 
We want one and all of youyto write to us, telling us whether you were ableto‘ solve the mystery

Nick Carter had to solve betorereading to the end of any

-the‘

of the stories. ' '

_ Tell us how far’ you read before you arrived atyour decision, and just w/mt paim‘,s g’uz'a’ea’ you in 
your dea'sz'm¢. Your letters will be printed in this column. » ' l 

The first letter we prlut this week is a corkcr; It was

. so long that we could not print the whole of it.‘ We are
/‘giving you the best part of it. In the opinion of the edi-'

tor it is a model piece of detective work. i

to give the chain of deduction followed by me in getting

at the core of the mystery. The novel, “Nick Carter and.
A the Professor,” opens in the first chapter with the de-
. T_scrAiption of a grave, or, rather, a vanltrobbcry. In this,
/"it is easilyseen that the men are no strangers to the

work from their absoluteutilization of every second_,Aand
business manner. Secondly, they are not merely getting

_ _a stiff for dissection——’-that is, an ordinary stiff, for no
 ‘crook would risk his precious neck by murderingﬁthe

watchman for the few dollarshe would get from the

V inedivcal students. And if it was an extraordinary one,

-‘what made it so valuable as to «cause a murder, to have

‘ “four men needed for lifting “a single corpscgandi to make

"such ‘elaborate preparations for its safe transznission.

,AEiAthet. some one wanted t:heAbody'to dissect on account

of a rare disease‘ or wished it for some unknown pur-

pose, ’Anyhow, the ghouls either were in the employ of‘

such a person orknewvthat he would; pay them highly
‘tor the subject. In choosing betweenthese two alterna-
;tives,_I was inclined to the former by the fact that ‘a

l .1. criminal, if not a condemned murderer already, or. a

V i{rui"I,'1an of the Bill Sikes style, would hesitate before kill-

§Af;;infgf a man, on the mere-possibility of gcttingh large

I V reward for the corpse.’  the contrary, if he had,been

f lprolmised Iaccrtain amount of money,’ and it was large

 ,.e‘n_dugh, he would when he hacltnearly earned lzismoney, ‘

_  not hesitate to ‘strike down the man who stepped in and
-- ; ’}‘virtua'.lly snatched the money from his hand. 

  The interview between Nick and Mr. Fielding furn-

’,.i{ishcs'us with a large qtrantﬁiy of data". which, properly

fused, Ought to ‘help us along a good distance. This in-

 

has known Hawley a long" time, and it is probabletha
he has treasured up some unintentional,» slight ‘at.-A
broodedover it inhis liermit life, until hehas develo
it into an insult. Now, the question arises, if he ha
Hawley, may he not have drugged the boy, .a11d,=Al)Ty.gct
ting him alive into his power, intended to wféakhi,
vengeance on the father thus. But thefaet that  it
was embalmed knocks this theory out. Even if the 
had been drugged’ with this motive, the corps.) wouldwbe
of no use to the man. More data islnecessary to.ﬁndi':ﬂ§
motive. Then comes the interview with Drungmorni
,’1‘l1ere, the queer talk,‘espe’cially aboutlthe elixer o£.lffe;,
not only settles the motive permanently under insauit 7‘
but show the reason‘ for the ielaboratelplans;]etc.,:.:n
also give the ﬁnishing stroke to the drug” theory. A
