A MYSTERY AMONG THE INEALLIBLES.

“You see, Mr. Carter, the thing has really gotten be-1
yyolndy endurance; We can’-t stand it any longer. Some-
.1jThin‘g must be done. We have kept these matters en-
7'iir_e1y away from the -police, not so mueh that we wished
-"~tl_1e_ police to have nothing to do with it, as because we

all desire to keep it out of_fthe papers. Last night--—0r.‘

riatherl this morning. immediately after the reception at

“Last night’s affair was another ‘getting together’ of
the Infallibles,” began Mr. Payson. s‘ “There were a few
absentees, of course; there usually is; but:” I
_ "One moment, if you please. There is a point upon
whichll wish you would dwell for a" moment. It’ is safe
to, assume, is it not, that suspicion could not possibly
point to any one of those who were absent last night?”

“Certainly.” . . ~ . ‘p

“Very well. I willask you, when you have ﬁnished
your story, to give me a list of the names of those‘ who
have been absent at the times when -other thefts were
committed.” a _ ’ V ' ‘

L“‘My dear Carter, 1 will do that, of course, as far as
I amable to comply with your request, but youniust
not misunderstand me in regard to one thing.” a l " 1 

“What is that?” ‘ , . . , T

“You seem to ‘have got the idea. that none of these
robberies have been committed only at times when‘ the 5;
Infallibles were together.” ’ ‘ K H

 

» “You certainly tried hard to give me that 1n1press1on.’7

    
 
  
   

“VVell, then, I have unintentionally misled you. ,The 
thefts have occurred at all sorts of functions a1nong_wh‘a§t,
«the public are, pleased to term the “four hundred.”L’It is
