That is a statement of their business in a nutshell;

of harbor police is a necessary thing to maintain.
The police call, such men river pirates; theytcall
themselves junkmen. L V
Among that class, Sandy Bragg was a leader; Cap-

tain Bill Gunn a very efﬁcient worker. But Buttons

had nothing to do with all that.

Buttons was a homeless, friendless waif of the.

streets. He sold papers in the morning and evening;

he ran errands; he carried baggage when he could; he i

did anything which would earn him a few pennies.
But .Buttons,lovjed the water; he lowed the river-
front, anzlduring his leisure moments, was fond of
being where he could see the shipping, wherethe oould
smell the brine. ' , ' I .

been left without anybody. _ . 1

It was Peanut Polly who had given him the strange
name, and the reason for it wasthat when she found
him underneath her peanut-stand one morning when
he was about three months old, he had, in addition to
his very elegant baby clothing, a string of bright but- \
tons around his neck, and he was cooing and playing ‘
with them when she foundhim. " , l o =

She used _often to tell that stbry about the baby
she had found, and then and there she named him‘VBut- ,
tons. , i  _
Such had been the lad"s first experiences in life§._

He was a sturdy little chap, and when Polly died,
the neighbors cared for him as well as they could in‘ B.
the midst of the multitude of their own responsibili-
ties. , o .

But theysaw to it that he did not starve; they gave , '
hinrfood, enough to keep him alive, and a place to ,

“My dear sir, simply because he recogpized him;
and, having recognized him, he knows that Buttons is
the only heir who can inherit the millions of their
father, since-he himself is under the bane of the law.
But if Buttons is out of the way, and if ‘later La-
Efarge can get you -into his power again, he may try

‘‘ once more to get outside thelaw, through you, and

then if the estate has not been administered, he could

’ claim it. Don’t you seeithat P”

“Yes; I think I do, now.”

“You see, if my theory holds good, it begins at
the time when Buttons was stolen.” 

“Well?” ’ p ,1 W '

“It was, of course, Paul Lafarge who stole the baby,
aided, or, at least, abetted, I have no doubt, by his
two sisters who are now dead. The father was prob-

ably hoodwinked into the belief that the child was
a born dead, but, in the meantime, the elder son by an-
other wife had carried it away to_ dispose of it.” , i

The chief nodded. ,

I “Paul Lafarge either brought the baby to this coun-
try himself, or, what is more likely, he induced some
emigrants who were bound f'or’Am,erica to take charge
of it for a consideration.” ‘ W i

V “Yes; that is more likely.”

B  “They might have tired of the child and ultimately
._ have left it under the peanut-stand where it‘ was later

Polly.”

have known either of these tgentlemen-~-certainly would
have passed them by unrecognized that night because
~ of the great changes that each of them had made in

He announced to Nick Carter thatglalthough he in-

dye from his hair he inﬁnitely preferred‘ it to a_ wig,

Moulin waved his hands and shrugged his shoulders,
smiling as he blew a cloud of smoke toward the ceil-

mg.
“By the best fellows in the world, Bras de Fer,” he

said contently. “Most of them, like ourselves, left

Paris because of the climate-”
“I saw a name in the paper ‘not long ago,” said
Gereaux, as if he were trying to remember the exact

_ date, “which reminded me of a combat that happened

in your place in Paris some years ago. The name was
Francois Laborde.” I it '

“Ah, yes,” said Moulin} and sighed, “but Francois’

will not be‘ here to-night. He is in prison.”

“To whom do you refer?” asked the proprietor. (

A’ “Lafarge was the name, and I never knew but one
Lafarge, and he was not in our line. .He was and iron-
master.”

“This man, l§ra‘s ‘de Fer, is his son.” '
“Well,” the chief shrugged his shoulders and held
his hands foran instant with their palms outward.

 “He must be rather poor quality of a man if’. that news-
, paper account was correct. It made hirnout a coward.

“Hush! I I beg of you, Bras de Fer.”

“But why?” ‘ M . {_ V. A/Z:

“Because we are not in Paris now, monsieur. , We
are in New York.” I ’

The loud and prolonged laugh which Gereaux ut-
tered filled the room and caused every eye in the place
to be turned in their direction. - f a ,

During it Moulin was visiblyagitated, and, while
leaning forward as if to arrange the things upon the
table, he whispered hurriedly into Gereauxis car;

“He is at the next table even now, Bras de Fer. I
beg of’ you to be discreet and quiet, and not to offend .
him since at present he is one of my best customers.”

“Oh, yery well, very well,” the chief replied, in a
loud tone, andthen, lowering his voice, he added;

“But poiht him out to me, Emile.” , 

“He is directly behind you, [but is seated’ with his 
back toward you.” A V ' p_ _ A I V V

éAt this statement Gereaux frankly turned squarely t,
around in hisvchair and stared at the back of the guest
who had been mentioned; and after, amomentfof-this

uscrutjiny on his part he resumed his former position,
and, with a shrug of his shoulders, said, still speaking f

' ﬂ

in an undertone: ,

“Upon my word, Emile,_ithe,appearanee of  back

‘but since he is one of your good customers and‘. he

“Yes,” Moulinnodded, ,“he, is in? disguise.”~
“Has he, then, been cracking, a safe or squirming‘ 
his body through; a second-story wwinidow'?” I A

him at the doorway with a pistol that wasn’t loaded.”
“It’s a lie,’A’ said Lafarge savagely.
“Oh, I supposed it was a lie, but it was none_the
less comical, monsieur.” T
“It was a lie,” repeated Lafarge.
I “Undoubtedly; but there was a_boy,‘wasn’t there?”
“Yes, there was a boy, but why do you insist upon
talking about this, Bras de Fer?” '
 “For myamusement, my friend. Do I offend you?”

“No, no, no, but why discuss it?" /»
‘ “For my entertainment, naught else.’ Tell me about
the boy.” ' ‘

~ “There is nothing to tell about the boy.”
“Oh,ryes, pardon me, there must be. The account

was so comical. It spoke about a boy who was cov—.

rere_d- with buttons; a little fellow it said, eight or nine

A years old.  think they even called him Buttons.”
_ Nick Carter had been watching this by-play with a

great deal of interest.  TA
He understood in the beginning exactly what Ge-
reauxr was getting at; he realized that the chief was

gradually bringing the conversation around to the point

‘ whereA he could introduce the name of Buttons.

And when at last the boy was mentioned and par-'
ticularly when it arrived at the point where, he re:

ing lwasidecorated, Nick could see that Moulinlstif-

, ’ fened in his chair;Athat the bAlood‘left his rather ﬂorid

face, and that the man appearedas if he weregreatly

worried over the turn that the conversation had taken. a

Gereaux changed the subject quite abruptlythen and
asked for the latest news fro-m Paris. He ‘felt that he
had badgered Lafarge and Moulin quite all that was
necessary. _

It was a condition which it would not bewise‘ to

A overdo.

Men of the character of this proprietor and his _
guest can be driven just so far and no further without
creating suspicion, and no one was better aware of this
fact than Henri Gereaux, chief of the secret police‘
of Paris. , V A y ’ A

Therefore, he asked for the latest news from ‘.‘theAI , 
only city, on earth.” A , A A ‘ -, . ' 

Instantly _A Moulin was all volubility, and Lafarge
himself, as if greatly relieved by the turn the conver-_
sation had taken, became eager to‘ impart all the in'-,

» formation he had at ‘hand and much more that he ‘i:.

rnanufaiftured for the occasion as Gereaux quickly sur-

Lafarge walkedaway then, and for a moment the
two detectives were quite alone, and they,leaned' for-
ward across‘ the table in order that they might con»
verse together in low tones without the chance that
their conversation would be overheard. j

“Well, Nick, what do you think of it P” asked Ge-
reaux. V p _ J i I
“Why, it begins to look to me as if we had the game

“Are you quite satisﬁed with the way I play it?” »
._ “Quite. It couldn’t be done any better.”

y “We have accomplished considerable already,” Ge-

reaux went on. “We have found Lafarge and where .

‘ Lafarge is it is pretty safe to say the boy willinot

‘ be far away.” ,, .
“I think,” said Nick, “judging from the action of

the two men while you were talking about Buttons

that he is somewhere in this house at this moment.”
“I have no doubt‘ of it,” said Gereauic.‘
“But where ?’’i I

“More than likely in the room occupied by

with a grunt of approval followed Moulini from the
room. M .

They ascended three ﬂights of stairs, which went up
directly’ through the hallway from the basement, and
there he‘ ‘was ushered into the-front room. .

he did‘ not hesitate. I

One of the instruments with which he had provided
himself for the work of that night was a sectional»
“jimmy” small but powerful, and this he quickly pro-
duced from one of his pockets, and, having ‘screwed

‘ ittogether, was readyito beginwork.

First he tapped upon the door gently and then louder
than before, but to neither ‘of these summons did he
receive ‘any response.  '

‘Satisﬁed that if Buttons were indeed conﬁned in
that room, he was so situated that it was impossible for
 him to reply, Nick applied himself to the task in ‘hand,
attacking that edge of the door where the hinges

: were located rather than the one where the Yale lock »

: held it so tightly in place.

The wonderful power exerted by a burglar’s “jim- ’

2, -my” when properly handled was never betteriexemp1i-
ﬁed than in this particular case, and it was only a mo-
 ment before the door began to give under the enor-
3 mous pressure, and "from the time, Nick Carter ap-
plied the “jimmy” to its task until he wasenabled to
insert the ﬁngers of his hand between the door and
 the casing, no more than two or three minutes could

‘fPaul Lafarge has not the courage to kill, but he can ‘

torture.”

Poor .little Buttons still resplendent  his strange

decorations was tied in a standing position against the _
V back wall of the closet, and he looked as if he had been

there indeﬁnitely. The 1ad’s face was drawn and bag-
gard, but his courage had not defaulted, and, although
he did not recognize Nick Carter in the disguise he
wore,—he knew that it was a rescuer who had come to
him.  _ ,
“Hold me when you cut me loose,” he said. “I am
so cramped that I’m afraid 1’11- fall.” ‘
.. “Poor little chap,” exclaimed Nick, in his natural
tone. ' T
And Buttons uttered a cry of delighted surprise. T
,“’Mr.i Carter!” he exclaimed. “I am so glad you
have come.” '

You  be sure that Nick Carter did not occupy

much‘ time in liberating the boy from the /bonds that 3

‘held him, and then he liftiedhim in his arms and l id
him for a moment upon the bed. ‘ i

He brought ivater for the lad to drink andirubbed i

spatted him until he got up the circulation, so that

after a _few moments of t,his,treatment, Buttons.star_ted ._

 “I’m all right, now, Mr. Carter» I’n_1ijust’as good i

as ever, but I‘don’t think I’d had held out very: much

him here. ,There should be one about now on the
corner directly above here.”

Without waiting for ananswer, he sprang down
the stairs, hearing the shouts and curses from the
basement as he proceeded, and having put Buttons out-
side the door as he had said he would do, he turned
to descend to the basement himself, just as the strug-
gle that was going on below came into the hallway
and followed ulpithe stairs. .

In another instant Gereaux almost rushed into the
arms of Nick Carter, and immediately behind him, in
close pursuit came Moulin, followed by several others
of his kind. ,

“All right, Gereaux,” Nick Carter shouted, andhe

Them you runitoward the square on

fleaped past his friend just in time to grapple with

Moulin himself.

Nick Carter's arms shot forward quickly, and Mou-
lin felt himself raised from his feet: and turned com-’
pletely over; and then Nick Carter, having secured a
good hold upon the «man, whirled him with all the
force he had, and shot him like the projectile from
a catapult down those baseineiit stairs straight at the
heads of the other men who were ascending them.

Have you“ever set up dominoes in a line to make
what is called a ]acob’s ladder? 7

If you have, you will know the effect of a human
projectile hurled by an animated catapult, which ‘in
this instance was Nick Carter. _

The attacking party went down as if they were so
many straws before a sudden gust of wind, and while
they were still falling and "shouting Nick Carter turned
again, and, with a sudden grasp upon Gereaux’s arm,
rushed him to the front door, openediit, and dragged
him through it to the steps outside the house.

Just as they emerged Buttons appeared at the bot-
tom of the steps accompanied by a policeman, and
Nick called out to him: I

“Rap for assistance, officer, and placeievery man
in this house under arrest for disorderly conduct; In
the morning I will appear against them, and there are
two here whom I especially want.” ’

NEW NICK ,CiARTER VVEEKLY.

“Who are you?” demanded the ofﬁcer.
“I am Nick Carter,” said thefdetective, showing his
shield.

‘We could use up almost another story in describing
the scenes that took place following upon these inci-
dents, in recovering for Buttons, now known as Henri
Lafarge, the property and wealth that had been
amassed by his father.

But all that is not necessary. It is sufﬁcient to state
that in Gereaux, Buttons found an invaluable friend
who saw him bravely and safely‘ throughall his darn-

culties, and who thoroughly established him in his.

rights in France.
We might also use up much space in describing the

delight o,f Sandy Bragg and Captain Bil Gunn when .

on the following day after the incidents just described
they were summoned to ‘Nick Carter’s house to meet
Buttons again, now dressed in a new suit of clothes,

and for the ﬁrst time in his life content to be withput

his remarkable ornamentation. _

Nick permitted them to hold a long conversation to-
gether, but when at last he did enter the room where
they were, he turned with pa quizzical smile to the two
former river pirates, and he said: I

“Sandy, and you, Bill, when I took this case to ﬁnd
Buttons, you each agreed to pay me a certain fee.
I am here now to demand that payment. My fee was
your promise that if I succeeded in ﬁnding Buttons
you would botli forsake the lives you had been lead-
ing and would become good citizens and good men. I
ask you both now to fulﬁl that promise.”

,“Mr. Carter,” said Sandy, extending his hand which
Nick grasped without hesitation, “I can speak for
both. Bill and I have talked it over. There’s my
hand on the word I gave you, and I’ll keep my promise
as long as I live. And there's Bill Gunn’s hand, too.
He’s sticking it out now, and you can bet your sweet
life that his word's as good as mine.”

AN ADVENTURE IN URUGUAY.

By GEORGE H. COOMER. 

When the old worn-out ship,Cano7/a, put into Monte-
video, at the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, she was leaking
so badly.that it was all we could do to keep her afloat.
Her timbers were rotten, and, to make/the case worse, she
had run into ice off Cape Horn, a mishap which came
near being fatal.

~However, she had a full cargo of oil, and, when a survey
had been held on her, and she was condemned at the South

American port, we fellows who had made the round voyage
All hands were paid off ac-

cording to their various “lays,” and then, putting on new
suits of sailor “toggery,” we had only to stroll about, see-
ing the sights of a country where none of us had ever been
before;

I had a chum named Jack Laythan, an intelligent young

man from the State of (New York, and while our shiprnates

interested themselves in their own manner, we two deter-
mined that before going home we would see something of
the interior of Uruguay. ' ‘

Our first meeting with each other had been as green hands
on board the Comma three years before, but our tastes being
much alike, we at once became fast friends. V

Before going to sea, both had been somewhat accus-
tomed to the use of guns, and we delighted to talk of
them. Jack, however, had the advantage of me, as he had
killed a deer, while my chief exploit in boyhood had been

- the bringing down of a wild goose from a flock which ﬂew

over our house one April morning when I was about ﬁfteen.

VVe were now nineteen years of age, and it. was a long
time since eit er of us had handled a ﬁrearm of any kind;
but the old-ti e enthusiasm was not forgotten, and we had
a keen desir to try our fortune upon the wide South
American pampas, to which we were now so near. There
was a bewitching charm in the thought,of camping out all

X

by ourselves upon those vast plains traversed by thousands
of wild horses and equally wild cattle.

Ttue, we did not leave out of the picture the prowling
jaguar, with which, in the wilds of Uruguay, one is always
in danger of meeting; but against this ferocious brute we
hoped that our camp-ﬁres by night and our guns by day
would prove a suﬂicicnt protection. The danger might be
considerable, but even this had its attractions, for we were
young and full of conﬁdence.

From a Boston man who kept a store in Montevideo we
bought two guns and a supply of ammunition, some mos-
quito-netting, and a quantity of light cotton cloth sufﬁcient
for a small tent. Two hunting-knives, a coffee-pot, and
a couple of tin cups completed our equipment; and with such
furnishings we probably made a somewhat picturesque ap~
pearauce upon starting out for our ﬁeld of operations.

First of all we went by rail from Montevideo to Colonial,
a distance of nearly a hundred miles‘, and thence, taking
passage in a native bungo, which is the Spanish name for
small,craft, proceeded up the Uruguay River.

It was plain that the boatmen had not a very high
opinion of us as hunters, and we could see also that they
made themselves merry over our ambitious attempts at
mastering Spanish santenccs; yet, nevertheless, they were
such good—natured fellows that we got on swimmingly with
them. -

The bungo, which was going up after hides and horns,
made slow progress against the current, yet everything was
so new to us that the voyage was not in the least tedious.
The river abounded with water-fowl, and the shots we made
at the birds were so successful as evidently to raise us much
in the estimation of our companions.

VVe saw vast masses of wild cattle at a distance, but the
most thrilling spectacle was that of a jaguar lying upon
a log which extended out into the river. He had one paw
resting in the water, and was apparently engaged in fish-
ing. Indeed, we soon had ample demonstration that such
was the case. As we watched him, the big paw, serving
at once for bait and hook, suddenly whipped out a shining
prize, with which the captor quickly retreated toithe shore.
VVe ﬁred at him, but with no perceptible effect, and he
disappeared among the tall grass of the bank. ‘

The Uruguayans had only two old ﬂint—lock guns’, and
both of these missed ﬁre; so that when we proposed by
signs and words that the bungo should go nearer the shore,
our boatmen friends shook their heads. They would take
no more risks than they could help. They knew the jaguar
to be a great swimmer, and the river was none too wide at
best, they seemed to think._

The picture of that lithe, powerful beast, which ‘we
knew to be one of the ﬁercest creatures in the world, lying
with his_hroad paw in: the water, or bounding up the bank
with the big ﬁsh between his jaws, impressed us~with a
sense of our surroundings more than anything that we had
previously seen. ‘ '

At night the bungo anchored iri themiddle of the stream,
and the next morning proceeded as before. A second night
was passed, and on the following day we arrived at a
trading-station, consisting of a small village inhabited by
Gauchos, or half—ln-eeds, who lived by catching wild horses

for sale, and hunting the cattle of the pampas for their _

higcs, horns, and tallow, which were sent down to Monte-
vi eo. » ‘ . ,

Our appearance among them excited some curiosity, but
although they seemed to be little better than savages, we
found nothing to complain ‘bf in their treatment of us»-the
greatest drawback which we experienced being in our lack
of Spanish, of which we could master so few sentences.“

Here we saw horses in all stages of training, from wild
to tame; and the feats of the Gauchos in maintaining thcir
positions upon the backs of some of these vicious creatures
were wonderful. Jack and I might have procured horses

 30

at a very low price, but the value we set upon our necks,

decided us to do our hunting on foot.

We could take our own time for it, camping where and
when we pleased, and should any large game fall before our
bullets or buckshot, we would makea present of it to our

‘ half-savage friends, who would gladly accept it as coming

within the line of their business.

there was so much to excite our interest.

Although the pampas stretched out on every side, it must
not be supposed that ‘the entire country was an unbroken
plain. On the contrary, there was a considerable diversity
of surface,‘ with occasional thickets and clumps of trees.
Upon the whole, however, one was impressed with the idea
pf an immense meadow, where the treeless spaces so pre-

V ponderated as to make all else seem insigniﬁcant.
i That day we traveled a number of miles, setting up our

diminutive tent as it ‘grew near sunset, and’cooking our
supper in the most approved style of wild hunters. We
had killed a few birds and some other small game, but

felt a little disappointed at not having been able to obtain .

‘ a shot at either wild cattle or deer, thoughweihad ‘seen

multitudes of both.

Great as was our dread of jaguars, we 1iad,‘at the same
time, a strong desire to meet with one; yet neitherthese nor
any other animals of the cat family had crossed our path
during the day. , i l
‘ Our camp waspitched in a hollow about a hundred
yards from the river. There were no trees at the spot, but

we’ gathered some drift branches which the Uruguay had.‘

deposited in previous freshets, and with these kept a fire

the greater part of the night, though it went out before .
imorning. . . / ‘

' .
Awaking soon after daybreak, we were conscious of hear~
ing a succession of indistinct ‘sounds, as from some crea-

~‘ ,.ture in motion at a little-distance; and, taking up our guns,

we peered cautiously over the ridge which enclosed our

hollow. Parting some tufts of thick fgrass, which prevented

us from being seen, we gazed out upon the pamper.-

iWhat an exciting spectacle met our eyes’! In plain’/view,
and scarcelylmoreithan half a furlong from us, was an im-
niense' herd of wild horses. The splendid animals were

"g_ra_zing upon the rich green grass, without the least sus-
_ picion ‘of our proximity. The ridge prevented them from

seeing our tent, and they were gradually getting nearer. At
times, with a uick toss of the head and a,half—gallop, some
of them woul change their positioniwhile ‘from the great
herd of so many thousand hoofs th’eiie came a continuous-

They were of various colors, precisely like domestic
horses--solme bay,‘ others roan, and many of a deep creamy
hue} Some were perfectly black, some milk-white; while
not a few ‘were beautifully mottled" with white and black
or white and red.’ ‘ " ' i A

, ,Their enormous column’ was extended at great, length

parallel with the river, so that we were shutin between,the

. Uruguay and this living mass,~of which, from our position, ~

we could see neither end.. The vast army, however, did

a not seem to reach far back,‘ having app/arentlyistretched out

N‘EW NICK (CARTER WEEKLY.

Only one chance remained for us——w_e tz_nust gain the
river or be trodden into the earth. Springing out of the
hollow, we ran for life—-yes, almost .ﬂew——with the uproar

’of those countless hoofs close upon our tracks! The weight

of that rushing’ mass seemed to make the very pampa
tremble. .

Leaping down the river—bank, we waded to the depth
of our armpits, holding our guns above our heads. It would
have been useless to ﬁre, for the frantic horses could not
have swerved aside if they would. Plunging, ﬂoundering,
and ﬁnally swim‘niing,‘they turned the Uruguay into a living
mass of heads and manes and tails! Yet, once in the water,
their progress was, of course, much slower than on land,
and, although every moment in danger of being overwhelmed
by them, we had here some little chance of avoiding a direct
contact. ‘ ‘ v - r ;

W,ith our shoulders just above water,’we stood swinging
our guns about ‘us in a terriﬁed endeavor to protect our-
selves, but more than once we were staggered and nearly
il’lI‘OVVl‘l'V,(lOVVﬂ. We could touch the swimming steeds with
our hands, and it seemed a marvel that we did not get fairly
wedgedamoiig them as they passed. . . i

It ‘was an"unspeakab'le relief to see at last that they had
nearly all gone by, so that we were no longer in ‘danger of
being crushed by their wild, mad ﬂight.

But now, all of a sudden, the cause of the mighty stam-A

-pede was revealed; and the discovery thrilled usifrom head

to foot. In the Jvery rear of, the herd two noble horses were
helplessly ﬂoundering, with a pair of huge jaguars clinging
to their shoulders. The poor, victims were overcome in-a

ifew moments, and the ﬁerce beasts began dragging them

toward the .shore—swimmii1g as they tugged ‘at their bulky
prey' ‘ ' r I ’ . V ,5 I

It was plain that they had observed us, for we could see
their blazing eyes turned in our directioniwith .4 look which
seemed to defy all meddling. Our guns were wet, but for-

tunately the caps were water—proof, and so, with verylittle ‘ii

hesitation, yve decided upon hazarding a. shot. ,

Standing in the water, we took careful aim, each selecting
his mark; but I know_that my heart beat very fast and it
quite sure that ]ack’s*did, also.’ It was an.aim which inig 1;
mean life or death for us. -

As the heavy reports’/of ourguns br’oke.upon the air, there.
was a moment of terrible uiicertainty. Then, as the smoke

was blown away, wesaw both jaguars kicking upon their,‘ ’

backs, their, convulsive struggles throwing the water in all 7 4

directions. ' , . ,   m I y
We took goodicare not to approach them until all, signs

gof ‘life were gone/, and then dragged them on ~shore,,where 
’ we found that each had ‘been, hit

\

Both of the ferocious‘. creatures were big fellows, with ~ '~
. stout legs‘ and fearfully broad claws; but, ‘notwithstanding

their ﬁerce, grim. look and bloodthirsty character, they were

"superbly spotted coats. ' , J _ v.»
