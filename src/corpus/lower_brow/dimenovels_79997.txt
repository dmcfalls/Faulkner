CHAPTER I.
THE VANISHING or GEREAUX.

‘ The acting chief of the Paris secret police hadpbeen.
in the City of New York’ about a fortnight as the guest
of Nick Carter, although, at the particular request of
the chief, the detective had put him up at the Cretorian
Club instead ofentertaining him at his home.

V, Gereaux had come to the United States on the trail
of a pair of rascals named Pierre Laborde and Jules
Creel, who had conspired togethei to defraud two
young women, Adrienne and Yvanne Lafarge, of the
sum of ﬁve million francs left to them by their father,
who had been an ironmaster in one of the departments,

in the south of France.

In carrying out their machinationsvagainst these

young women these two men had, committed other

crimes, notably the murder of the maid who had served

,;;the heiresses; thisparticular crime, Chief iGereaux.;hLa'd,
wtraced to Labordebefore his departure for America.
7 ‘X. The two men had then ﬂed to the Unite‘dLStates,~ hav-'3

‘  ring by means of threats compelled the heiresses to acid

' company them, and, after their arrival in the citywof V’

’l>lefw York they had done them to death by means of

prussic acid administered in such a manner as to make
it appear that thevictims had committed suicide.
In this heinous crime they hadibeen assisted by an

unnatural and inhuman half-brother of the heiressés, ‘

named Paul Lafarge. V - p _ ' A
These crimes had been traced directly to the perpe-
trators by Nicholas Carter, who had, succeeded in ac-
complishing it by one of the most remarkable tests
that he had evier¢app1ied.to his“unquestioned detective
skil1.* _ i M ' _ ' L i
It is not necessary that we should go into particu-

lars concerning these other crimes,‘ ‘since. they have

nothingto do with our present story save only that

they led up to it, and that it was beeauseof ‘them’_and , ,
because of the activity of M. Gereaux in trailing those
men from Paris that the puzzling conditions arose

which are to be recited here; ” : V — _ 3 l
Immediately afterthe arrest of /Laborde and Creel,

and of Natalie, the wife of Laboi-dee, which occurred:
in a high-stoop, brownstone house on a sidestreet not -
far from Lexington -Avenue, Gereaux and  Carter _ i

spent the evening as follows: ’ "

Carter‘ repaired to the Cretorian Club together, where
they dined, and, alew hours later‘, repaired toa near-by

attriactinig considerable attention. They occupied seats
that were well down in the middle aisle‘ in the parquet,

The consequence of this was that he forgotpahout
Gereaui during the ‘entire production Aofthe third act
ofthe piece, and gave nopthought to the continued ab-
sence of the-‘Parisian until thercurtain lhagl dropped '_
again, and this was rnore than half an hour since the

> cleliivery of the note to the acting  the secret‘ i

police of‘ Paris.  A __

Now the detective did not hesitate to_le_ave hi__s”seat.f_
There remained only one more act to_the play, Geryp-J
eaux had said he would be absent only a quarter of
an hour, and he had already been gone Vmoretthan twice t

a small cigar, and strolled up and ‘_down while: hel

rather because the Parisian had sent no word back‘ to
Nick Carter explaining.-his continued absence.

The detective remained where he was, near his seat,
until the greater part of the audience passed out,.when-
he followed slowly into the foyer, lighted a big cigar

this time and stood there waiting, determined to remain

until the lights were put out, still believing, inasmuch
as lie had received no message, that G/ereaux would

_ return to the theater.

‘ While he waited, the usher who had conducted the
messenger down the aisle appeared, and Nick sum-
moned him to his side.

b “You are the young man who brought the messenger’
to me with that note for M. Gereauic, are you not?”

I _ asked Nick.

“Yes, sir.” ‘

“You followed my friend, out of the theater in com-
pianyi with the messenger", after the note was delivered,
I believe?” ' “ A i Y '

“Only so far as the rear of the house, sir. I did not
comeiinto the foyer.” V ‘

“You don’t know, then, who it was who sent him

the message ?”

“No, sir; I don’t know‘ who it «was, although I was

‘ in the foyer when the messenger boy arrived. I heard

hinifask for M. Gereauxiand heard him say that the
gentleman was withiyou. ,,I know you, *MI‘- Carter.
by‘sigh_t,'eand I knew where you were seated, so I took
him into the theater. .

“Was anybody with the messenger boy when he

,n

‘‘I couldn’t sayias to that, sir. I didn’t see anybody.”

The detective took a dollar from his pocket and
handed it to the ‘usher, saying as he did so:

- “I would like you to stand outside.the theaitergfori ,
half an hour after it is ‘closed, so that in case ‘M.
Gereauxireturn/s here you can inform him that I have’

gone to the club. . Yeiu may tell him that Iewill avvtait

Y . him there.” i _ V, ,, , e , it
i i’/Them club was within walking distance from the the-he
atcr, and Nick arrived there a‘ few moments‘ later, a

thinking that perhapsiGereaux,i havingibeein detained

 beyond the limit of ‘time he had ﬁxed‘, had ireturriedéto,
: the club instead of to the theater. pi e  “ ‘ .

arrival, Nick passed into the library and, "selecting a

favorite book, composed himself to reading.

In this ?manner an hour passed, and then another,‘

with no message from Gereaux and no sign of him
whatever.” A g . V " 

Nick, whotwas thoroughly aware of hereauxs
punctilious observance of all forms of courtesy, was

now distinctly troubled by the continued absence of '

the Paris chief; and yet there was nothing that he
could do to hasten the return of his friend.‘ In fact,

there wasnothing whatever for him to do save patiently -

to await his return or to give him up for theinight and‘

‘go home. ..

After a few moments of indecision he decided upon
the latter course, and wrote a note to the chief in

which he stated the length of time he had waited, hoped if

that the business which had called‘ him from the theater
was of a pleasant character, and closed by saying that
he would call at the club in the morning immediately
after breakfast. e ’ _ U i 1
Herode home then, went to bed, and slept"; , h
A little before ‘ ten o’clock the following morning
he strolled around to the club again, his misgivings en-’
tirely vanished and having no thought but thatGereaux

‘ would be waiting to receive him. , _ g ‘
-When he stepped to the desk,’ however, and made‘

his wishes known to the clerk, "you. may imagineiliis
surprise when he was informed: ' '

“M. Gereaux has not returned, ‘ Mr.”Carter.' 

has not entered the club sincerhe left it last night to;
go with you to the theater.” 3

Every question which Nick Carter could ask of the
employees of the playhouse developed no further in-
telligence than this: - '

Gereaux had been seen to lead the way up the mid-
dle aisle followed by .the messenger boy and the usher;
the had been seen by the treasurer of the house to pass
through the foyer toward the door, still followed by
the messenger boy, but from the moment that he passed
the threshold of the main entrance to the sidewalk of
the,» street upon which the theater was located, all
knowledge concerning him was lost. b

When Nick Carter received the information from

_ the clerkat the club that inorning that'Ge‘reaux had
not returned he immediately busied himself about ma-
king inquiries, although his -‘better judgrnent, as he lie’
i lieved, assured him that nothing could have happened

to, the Parisian, who —l1adall his lifedealt with me,

“Why, he knows the hull game; he sure does."

“Tell me about it,” said Nick. , A

“Well, you see it's this way. Cap’n Bill had been
out pretty early this mornin’ taking a row around the
river-front for pleasure. I guessilmebbe he’s been play-
in’ poker with some 0’ the canal‘-boat cap’ns just below
here. _ Anyhow, he says that it was about half-past
three o’clock or mebbe four when he "pulled his boat‘ up
under the pier andpput it away.”

-The detective nodded comprehendingly.

. “He had climbed to the top 0’ the ‘pier and was

about leavin’ it when he saw four men come out 0’

Stanton Street and come onto the pier, an’, seein’. how
late, it was, Capfn Bill didn’t feel jus’ like bein’ any
too friendly with strangers, an’ so he mooched back

1 It has been said that long practisemakes perfect in
anything, andlong and ‘continued practise, assisted by
close application, had developed..Nick,. Carter to a point:
where his powers'of reasoning were so acute that he

readily read a cause from an effect. b
You will recall the fact that at the time of the dis-
I appearance of Gereaux from the theater there was
absolutely no clue whatever _as.‘to what had become of
him. It should be said, however, in iustice to Gereaux
himself, that his own proﬁciency in his chosen profes-
sion was the real cause for Nick Carter’s present suc-
fsess. A ‘ p A L i
i Had Gereaux been less acute and less alert it would ,

not have occurred to him to have ‘written the letter
he had on that scrap of paper when hewas irnprisoned
in that room. V M
To most prisoners, conﬁned as he was, the small hole
‘ in the wall over his head would haven-siiggesigdi noth-1
ing more than a means of ventilation and an imperfect
and inadequate means of getting light inpfhe daytime.
, To Gereaux‘ it had meant liberty.‘ ' it t _ "

day came on. At sunrise I was ridin over a vast mesa;
or plain. The sandy soil was studde with thorny cactus
plants, and the only living creatures in sight were big lizards
that slipped from under my horse's feet. I was so deeply
interested in the sun glow that was lighting up the distant
peaks Oi’ amountain range that Irode to the,Ato of a slight
crest. without observingwhat was before me.» Ahen I low-
cred my eyes to encounter a strilcin scene. '

“Twenty yards distant lay a doe horse, and beside him
on the sand was stretched the body of a man, evidently
dead. Half a dozen: yards beyond was one of those gullies
or washouts that are so common in Arizona, and on the
bank of this was another man, bendin over with his back
toward me. What he was about I can d not see.

“My approach through the soft sand had not made the
slightest noise, but now my horse gave a slight whinny, and ~
the stranger, wheeled instantly, revealing the Swarthy fea-
tures o£—’—Pab1o Mariscal. The rascal's own riﬂed was lying
beside the dead stran er, and his horse wasipisketed-.some

1 yards off. With 3 s. arp cry. partly of surprise. partly of

anger, he snatched a revolver from his‘ belt and leveled it
at me beiore I could unstralp my Winchester, My sudden
appearance bad unnerved him. ‘Bang! ‘Bang! one bullet
wblzzecl b my ear-. the other grazed my horses ‘flank,’ and,‘
£lIun§_lng rantically, the beast dashed for the -gully. The

exlcan ﬁred another shot at close quarters. The horse

- A_ saved me. With alaullet through hisbrain. the poor brute

wheeled forward and went. into the gully hood foremost.
I sprang irom his back. and landed, feet ﬁrst. just as the
horse crashed down beside me. I kept in wits about me}

“Suddenly I fancied I saw a slight movement on the right
side of the rock, and as I ﬁxed my gaze on the spot Maris-
cal’s head appeared for one brief ‘second on just the oppo-

_site side and a revolver-ball plowed into the horse not an

inch from my ear. An involuntary jerk of the head was all
that had saved me, Mariscal’s clever ruse had nearly suc-
ceeded. He was back behind shelter before I could get a
shot, and I’ determined to be more watchful in future.

“The sun's rays grew hotter and hotter, and, after endur-
ing them with ‘what patience I could summon for some
minutes longer, I concluded that it was high time for the
farce to end.

“I was on the point of rising boldly and moving forward _

in hopes of getting the first shot, when a plan ﬂashed into
my! mind that offered more security and better chance of
success. ~

'“.Not ten yards to (he rear of my position the gully made
a rather sharp bend to the right, and I felt pretty sure that

V the ‘body of my horse concealed the nearest angle from

MariscaI’s view. If I could crawl stealthily away, keeping

,the horse constantly between the range of ‘the Mexican’s

vision, I might get round the bend unseen, climb out of
the gully and approach my enemy from the rear. It was a
bit of strategy well worth trying, and I at once prepared
to carry it out. I had a revolver in my belt—a big 44-
caliber-——and I placed this on the body of the dead horse in
such a way that the muzzle only could be seen from the
rock. Itﬁwas a poor ‘imitation of the bore of my’ Win-
chester, I knew, but I trusted thatwthe distance wohld pre-
vent Mariscal from discovering theruse. All the while, of
course, I held my eye onthe riﬂe and on the rock.

“Everything was now in readiness, and, dropping onhands

and knees, Ibegan to "crawl slowly backward. As I re-
ceded from: the horse the top of the rock came in sight, "

and I‘ had to get down still; lower until I was fairly squirm-

‘ ing likea serpent. The sus ense of those few moments may
I crept toward the coveted ar'1gle,¢

' peering over, my shoulder occasionally to get my bearings. .

The riﬂe I held, cocked, in one hand, hoping to have still '

be imagined. Inch by inch

a chance for life if thepmiscreant should discover my

stratagem and attempt to get the drop on me. \
“The last couplp of yards I grew so nervous that I was

afraid to look round, and I actually brought up against the

 ‘side of the gully. A glance showed me that the angle. was ’
.. close at hand, and a few more wriggliigig‘ motions brought

me to thelturn.  Rising cautiously_on ands and knees I
-could see, the top of the rock distinctly. So far all was

well. ' .

I , “I turned deliberately afhdt scuttled round the bend. ,
I v 1“When I lookedagain the horse and the rock were both

out of sight. . .

A» .j“Overjoyed at my present success, I rose fearlessly and,
I looked over the edge of the gully. y.The.c'oa‘st was clear, and,

clambering up the side” as ast as I could, I bent low and
scurried over the plain, making a wide détour to avoid the

spot where the Mexican was lurking. , V
‘. “Then with guarded step ‘I’ approached the gully again,
heading as accurately as‘I could jud e for a spot ten yards

1],, in the rear of my foe. The horse picketed on the opposite

side helped me in my estimate.

’ “As. I advanced,foot  foot, and bending. down as,.much

. as ‘possible, Isuddenly spied the crest of the boulder(p'__eep-.

ingover the brink of the gully, and a second glimpse, as.vI

 slowly: raised. my head, brought Mariscal into plain view.
— He,-/was stretched ﬂat behind the rock in the broilinginstin,
 his "revolver clutched in‘one~han“d and his, head ‘pressed

.a ainst the sand at one.-corner of the boulder. Not‘ the
, v'51:gIét'€__5t suspicion of my escape . coulcighave, entered his
» "50 iab,sorb_.edm was ;his attitude. that I advanced 2 to; -the 2

very ‘brink of the gully, my Winchester sighted on his head,
: ;of course. For a second orgtwo I enjoyed the silent

tableau, and then I shouted in a -loud, stern voi'ce:; ‘Drop
your weapon and surrender, Pablo! I have you this time.’

“He jerked himself half upright, the most surprisedxandj
angry Mexican ever seen, but my Winchester was staring.
into his eyes at a— distance of ﬁve yards, and with a bitter
imprecation he ‘lowered the weapon he had half raised.

“ ‘Throw it away,’ I commanded, and he tossed [the re-,
volver across the gully, snapping his blackveyes at me furi-
ously. Then I made him rise to his feet, holding his arms .
above his head in obedience ‘to the command, ‘Arriba lac.
memos!’ At this point I was" sorely puzzled to know what
to do with my oaptive. I dared not lower the weapon for
a single second, and I had about concluded to.march him
ahead of me across the sun-baked plain, when, to my great
relief, a small body of horsemen appeared on the crest of
a slight ridge, less than a quarter of a mile away, and a
shout spee'dily,drew, them to the spot. . ' ' .

“They proved to. be in Search of Mariscal’s, victim,, who’
lay. dead across the gully. The poor fellow was a mer-
chant from a neighboring town who was expected‘home
early that morning, and, becoming alarmed at his absence,
his friends had started out to look for him. ’ ,

“Mariscal narrowly escaped lynching, but my wiser copun-..

sel prevailed, and he was spared to pay the legal penalty ‘

for his crime a few months later._ . . ,
“The sombrero I. afterward claimed‘;.' and, as no..person

had a better right to it, it became my property. ‘ Do you

wonder that I regardit as an interesting memento?” ‘

“No,”_said I, as I placedit ‘back upon its hook, “I” I

assu_*redlyl do not.”

THE ACCIDENTAT TLI-IAEAH FoUNDRir7.;

 

 

Twenty years ago I was employed as“ an inspector.of'
engineering-work of various descriptions, chieﬂy ;connecte_dg
with railways. This occupation brought me constantly. in.‘ _
contact with the production and working of iron, in al-liits?
various branches and in many different parts ofthe country, I

At the time I refer to, a large contract had been"_pla,ced. *

with_a ﬁrm in Illinois for’ the material of an important/iron ~
bridge, for the supervision of which I was responsible,

This work included the casting ofvsome heavy iron gplatfes‘ f

of rather complicated designgfor the caissons of. the founda-
tion. , ‘ - _
The foundry where my plates were-cast was a large open‘ 2
shop, a hundred yards iin.l'eng?th and of greatheight. Across ;
one end of it, atpaboutrﬁfteen ’feet from the /ground‘, was
an iron platform suPP<9T.t_ed' on columns, and the imouth,'o:f‘
the “cupola,” or ‘melting-furnace, which iisupplieél" this.'.fn‘d“‘.
of the foundry,,was on a level with this platform.

In thecenter of the platform was: a deep bay, or recess,"
to receive thevcasting-pot-ea ,huge iron ealdrori holding
some eight or ten tons of molten metal. ° This was” s“us_-_,f~

ings, afterpwhich we left the shop together. l ‘

“I am*going to Chicago bythe moruin‘ express fora
couple of? days,” said Mr. - Conyers. “ ould you mind
wiring tome if you want anything special?”

I assented, and shortly afterward we parted.

The next morning, soon after six o'clock, I was ‘again in
the foundry, where a gang of men were preparing for run-

ning in the next charge for our plate-molds. As the opcra— '

tion required prompt movement and separate attendance at
each mold, they were standing round in a circle, each man
ready to do his own part. ' A ‘ V
TheVblazing stream irom the cupola was alreadylﬁlling
up the great vessel hanging at its mouth, and the men at
thel crane were waiting.to bring the charge out over the
mo ds.’ , i l ' » .
' As soon‘ as the furnace men with their irons had lifted
off one or two _ﬂa.l<es of scum from the glowing surface,
the casting-pot began tofmove majestically outward through

~ the recess, when a mishap occurred, of as kind, nnfortu-b
. natelys. too well known in these risky operations. [
One small trolley, underneath the platform, there hap-,

pened to be standing a long ‘cast-iron rxb belonging to some
girder work, which had been cleared from the mold and
was waiting to be moved aivay; V _ ’ A V
. Up to the monient of ‘bringing out the present charge from
the cupola, nobody had observed thatioue end of this rib,

just far enou h to touch the side of the casting- ot as it
pas~sed,clear o the platform. It-was but a matter 0 an inch
or two; but, as ill fate would have it, just suﬁiciént totip

the-lgreat potlforwardouf its pivot, and cause the weight of

the molten mass inside lo.overba.lance it. .
