Barryls banking. business had run down-8. good  ’
bit within the last six months. on account of ' 
, business depression, and only for the fact that » 

he was known far and wide in the cityas a pur-
chaser of old gold, bullion, out-of-date jewelry
and kindred articles, he would scarcely ‘have made *
his salt. He also bought and sold foreign money,
European bonds, and sold bills of exchange on 2
certain foreign private bankers with whom he .
had done business for years. '

_ Bob had taken to the business fromathe ﬁrst,
and as soon as he was promoted behind -the
counter, he devoted. all his energies to familiariz- ~
ring himself with its varied details.

The result was, he was now able to run things
in the absence of both, the banker and his cashier,
and do about as well as either of them. His
ambition was to go into the business" some day on 
his own hook, when he got capital enough to be f
able to make a start, and to that end he lost no
opportunity to pick up all the points he could.

Barry appreciated his services so much that
he had raised his wages right along, until now he  l
was getting $15, for the banker intended making '
Bob his cashier when the present incumbent, a
white-headed old man, who had been with Barry
from the day he started, dropped out. As Bob
knew how he stood in the oﬂice, he was one jof‘
the most contended lads in Wall Street. .Every-,
thing was lovely with him until, like a‘ bolt out
of a clear sky, Banker Barry unexpectedly an-\
nounoed that owing to a sudden turn of fortune's
wheel in his favor, he was going to give up busi-
ness for good and devote the rest of his life to
having a good time. p ’

This news gave Bob a shock, for it seemed to
take the ‘ground right from under him. at the very
moment when he was building aircastles around.

 _‘ haIppy—go-lucky young lad who didn"t seem to’ care

whether school kept or not. Bob was the only
one whom the news seriously affected.

I v“It’s the unexpected that always happens,” he

muttered gloomily, after his employer had told

aim what he was going to do. ,,“This business

 , suits me from the ground ﬂoor up, and now I sup-

" pose I’ll have to look around for something else,

. and begin all over again. I donft like that, for a

cent. It’s going to give me a big setback, not

only in wages, but in prospects. I should_thmk

‘ Mr. Barry would ﬁnd it more proﬁtable to dispose

of the business as it stands, than to let it go by

the run. I wish I had money enough to buy it, I

wouldn’t waste many minutes thinking; over it. I

:an run it almost as well‘ as Mr. Barry himself-

At any rate, I wouldn’t be‘ afraid to tackle it,

even if I had to put my last cent into it. The

banking department has run down pretty low, but

when times get better I have no doubt that most

of the old customers could be induced to come

back. They all know me, and I stand well~with

them. The new customers are alwavs to be got

if ‘you knowhow to securethem. As for the other

' branches of the business. I’ve got them down as

line as silk. Mr. Barry thinks a whole lot of me,

and Has promised to get me another job, so I

I think if I ‘had a few thousand dollars I could call

, upon, he'd let me have the business.‘ But what’s

the use of thinking about it? I haven't any funds,
and that settlesit.”

' It was half-past twelve when Bob got .«back

’ from the errand which took him down Broad

Street.‘ A smoothvfaced man, clad in 9} new busi-

ness suit, was standing at the counter bargaining '

with the cashier over a lot of broken gold and sil-
‘ ver jewelry, from which the stones had been re-
’ ‘moved. It lay spread out on the counter, and Bob
noticed that the whole lot was in a badly damaged
. condition, as though it had been pounded out of
shape. The man glared at him in an unpleasant
 way when he passed behind the counter, and al-
most immediately he broke off negotiations,
brushed the stuff into a small handbag, and went
away abruptly. . I , :
_ “‘Bob,”. said the‘ cashier, “Mr. Barry has sold
I that square safe yonder, and he told me to tellI
you to remove everything from it, as it is" tobe
taken away this afternoon.” '

knew that it was a most unusual circumstance
for professional thieves to offer swag of this kind
for sale in Wall. Street. Only men whose faces
were not familiar to the detectives who guarded -'- I
the ﬁnancial district day and night, would _under- '
take such a risk. But regular crooks are not the‘

man, with a keemloolc‘. , I - ‘
Banker Barry Wasn't in, but under the circum-

“He’s in, but engaged,” he answered. , _
The two men _looked at each other. and an‘~in- , ~
telligent grin ﬂickered for a moment on the faces ’
of each. As a matter of fact. they knew that the
banker wasn’t in, for they-had just seen.him talk— I "
ing to a gentleman on Broad Street. The smooth- I .
faced man had asked the question in order to see '_i ~
how “ﬂy” Bob was. His answer told them that I .
the boy, aware he was alone, was on his guard. , 
“I was in here a while ago, trying to make a _
deal with the white-haired gentleman for a quan-.  ‘

with the smooth face, watching Bob closely,,while ‘ ,' ‘

 than when he felt the cold point of the révolver
,, ~ against his head and realized that the officegwas
at the mercy of the two crooks. _ I
_ . , He knew the safe-door was open a.few inches,
thus giving the rascals the opportunity to make
a big haul. Even before the threatening words of
the smooth-faced man had ceased to echo on his
' ear, the thought ﬂashed across his mind that by
reaching out his arm he could close the safe and
turn the combination handle. ’

That would queer the crooks game, for they
never could open the safe then. But the rlsk he
must take to do that chilled his blood. _If the man

, snare that placed the situation in the hands of
the thieves. Therefore, he owed it to Mr. _BarrY

 to ‘retrieve’ himself even at the risk of his life.
' Then‘ he acted. His right hand ‘shot toward the

-' safe, gasped the handle, and bang went the heavy ‘

steel door, and rattle went the handle. _ u

A third manentered with a couple of stout,
wooden wagon-spokes, the ends of which were
tipped with iron. While one of the men was busy
removing the window-sashes, the other two, with
the aid of the spokes, moved the safe out from be- ,
hind the ‘counter, and part of the way to the Win- “ ' '
dow. The men left the room and spent some ,
time in the office overhead, arranging the end 
tackle that was to bear the weight of the safe‘ in
its descent to the street. When this was ﬁxed to
their satisfaction, they returned to Bari-y’s oﬂice

from the ﬂoor to the window-ledge to act as skids.
A thick piece of iron was laid‘ on top of each. A, 1
sling, made of very thick rope, was passed around
the safe. and to the ends was attached the iron s
hook connected‘ with the tackle; All being in
readiness, the ‘man who was bossing the job
shouted to the two. men on the wagon below‘ to 3 ”
turn the windlass attached toithat vehicle. The 
tackle, grew taut, and the strain coming on the
safe, it rolled slowly up on the skids. and ﬁnally ,
swung .out of thewindow. T_he foreman of the
job sprang on top of the suspended safe to go
down with it, and fend it clear of the building.
During its descent the safe-door swung open the’
fraction of an inch. and to this circumstance Bob.
probably owed his life.

Mr. Barry came up while the safe

As the safe touched the sidewalk, Banker ‘Ba1'!"y*'
heard muffled sounds coming from its interior. '
The door was not‘ tightly “closed, so he swurigit

“Why, Bob,” he exclaimed, “what, in creation '

raised his young employee from the pavementp
and tore the towel from his face. He saw that ,,
the boy was in a bad way.’ , ' 
“Help the carry him into the building!” he said
to the ‘bystanders, . 
Two .men‘responded, each seizing(~the boy by"
one of his legs. When they laid him down in the
corridor, Bob revived somewhat. One of the men 7
produced a small ﬂask of whisky from his hip 
pocket, and removing the metal stopper poured
some of the liquor down the boy's ‘throat.’ Bob
was not used to spirits, and he coughed and ’
sputtered. The whisky, however, brought him
around in short order. and he got onhis feet; *
with the aid of .f,he banker’s arm. i - 1» '
.“For gracious‘ sake.,B0b. tell. me what is the
meaning of this. ' How come you to be in the. saf

_mation, but as those men were as much In the
 dark on the subject as themselves, they learned
nothing. . _ ’ _ ,
‘‘I’ll talk with you in your private office,” said’
Bob as they entered the outer oﬂice.
, .T_he‘old cashier ‘seemed to be in a state of con-
, siderable perturbation when they appeared. He
had discovered the loss of the money from his
drawers, and he didn’t know how to account for
 i it.- He approached his employer to report the
fact.
“I will see you in a few minutes, Mr..Willo_ugh-
, by,” said Barry, as he led Bob ,to_ his private
.. room. “Sit down, Bob; you look all in.” ~ .
‘ The boy was glad to do so, and after drawing
‘a long breath, he began his story about his visit
of the two crooks while he was alone in the office;
how they caughtchim dead to rights, and how,
‘with’ the muzzle of the revolver pressed against
his temple, he had shut. and locked the big safe
' with ‘onehand. and thus saved -nearlv everything

of value in the little counting-room. The banker

listened with breathless interest to’Bob’s narra-
tion. He did not doubt for a moment that the

,5 . boy told the truth. His admiration“ of Bob’s pluck, «

in the face of what seemed like certain death, was
unbounded. _. . I
,“You are a real hero.” he exclaimed, grasping
the boy bythe hand. “By George! Mighty few
’_ ' boys, or men either, for that matter, would have

‘ -strangled condition insidethe safe.” ’
“You had a- narrow escape from death, my boy,
I " and’I’ am very grateful to youfor saving the big
safe from being looted, for it would have fur-‘
nished a ﬁne haul forthe Scoundrels.”
“ «Banker Barry immediately communicated with
’ ,.the police by ’phone, telling them all the circum-

   

  
  

description of the crooks as Bob gave ‘it to him.
Telling the boy to remain in the private room till
he felt all right again, the banker went outside to
:. see his cashier.‘ The old gentleman then informed
/. him that two, of the drawers of his desk had been

 
  
   
    
  

.‘ American money and French coin abstracted by
-some person unknown to him. This. news did not
‘surprise the banker, after what he had learned
from the -boy. He repeated Bob’s story to his
cashier, and that “gentleman was dumfounded.
U‘Barry then examined the interior‘.of the big safe,
_ which the cashier told him he had found locked on
 his return from lunch. and saw. that nothing was

missing from it. He then returned to his private

saved me probably $50,000. Ten per cent. of that‘, - 0'
is not too much to bestow upon you in recognition

Banker Barry drew his checkbook toward him , -,
and ﬁlled out a -check for $5,000, payable to t_he'=:'__;
order of Robert ‘Honner, which he signed and._ .
handed to the boy. Bob accepted it with,some». 
reluctance,‘ for it seemed to be a large sum of 
money for what he -considered an act of duty»to-- ’ 7

The interview continued a while longer, and
then Bob returned to his duties. It was now
nearly three o’clock, and he had had no lunch. "
But ,he didn't feel hungry; he was too excited to ‘
think .of his stomach. How he ﬁnished his duties.
up_to ﬁve o’clock when business was over for the 0
day, he never knew. Then he took an elevated
tram for home. He hardlymore than glanced
over the pages of his evening paper, so absorbed
was he in delightful visions of his business fu-
ture. He was going to be boss of his own banking ‘
and brokerage business on Wall Street, and he
yvtvas fully assured that he would make a success of

He was so tickled that his face shonewith the
delight he inwardly felt, and it was as much as he
could do to keep from letting out a whoop that _
would certainly have astonished‘ the assengers ,
in the car, and led them to think that e had es- /'
caped from some lunatic asylum. From the sta-
tion to his home, he felt as if he was walkin on '

“Why, whatever is the matter with you, Bob?’’“.
she asked. ~ - . V _ ' I

His answer was to seize his mother about the 
waist and dance around the kitchen with her, in
the most ridiculous fashion. '  }_

“Dear, dear, what is the matter with you, Bob?” » .
she said breathlessly, when he finally paused in 
his wild gyrations, and allowed her to regain. her ‘)7
balance. - ’ ’ ‘_ 

“Matter!” cried Bob, looking at her with shin- F“

Mrs. Homer showed her astonishment in her
face. It was not until Bob sat down, which he
was now able to do, after he had let off his en-

. thusiasm and recovered his rational state of mind ~

once more, and went into details, that the happy
little mother realized that Bob. was telling her
’ nothing but real facts. When his sister came
home from business, for Grace Honner was em-
ployed as cashier in a downtown restaurant, Bob
surprised her with the glorious tidings, too.
“Why, Bob, it isn’t possible that you're going
to be a real banker?” she cried.
“Well, I’m not going to be anything else, sis,
I can assure ’you,” he replied.
“A real banker on Wall Street!”
~“Yes, a real banker on Wall Street.”
“M-y gracious! » What will all our friends say
when they hear that?” x '
“T’l,i'ey can’t say anything against me, at any
rate. , , x
‘ -,“Of course not, dear, how could they? But they
will be astonished.” . V
, ‘ “I have no objection to that. I don't expect
‘that any of them will have an attack of heart
I ’ failure over it.”
I Gr ce laugléd, threw her arms about her
brot r’s neck and kissed him. , . . . I
“Pm so glad you are coming out,-Bob,” she
said. “You’ll make a lot of money, won’t you?”
“I hope to, in time. You can’t expect me to be-
. come a millionaire, all at one time,” laughed Bob.
, “No, how silly! I mean you’ll_ make a good
, deal in than you've been getting from Mr.
f w Barry.’ ' _ ' , "
. y ' ‘fl ought to, if things go right.”
= ,.-“When do you begin?”
, f ‘‘I can’t tell you the exact date, but. it will be
just as soon as Mr. Barry is ready to quit." ‘
“I shall be awfully proud to think that I have
- a brother who is a banker.” _ _ _
f‘You mustn’t tell anybody, until I am making

enough so you can give up your job at the res- ’

$3,. taurant.” ' V

i ;“Why not?” in surprise.
, , “Because it would look funny for you to have to
go out working when you had a brother who is a
'Wall Street banker. See the point?” -

 Bob then told his mother and sister about his
strenuous adventure in the oﬁice that day, and

how that was really the cause of his reaching the

. acme of his hopes. He had held this recital back
, to the last, as he knew it would startle them, and
_ .they certainly were startled and concerned over
the nai;row escape he had’ had.

placed the greater part of his capitalifor the
present, leaving about $1,000 in the big safe.
He also kept nearly $1,000 worth of foreign

money on hand, for there was a constant call for

'it‘from regular customers of the bank. Lately
. there had been scarcely any proﬁt from this
2*. branch of the business, as few‘ foreigners with

,. money to exchange for American equivalent had,

I dropped in.

Bob laid this to the withdrawal of Barry’s
standing advertisement from -the newspapers, so
his first duty. was to order it continued under his
own name. The first visitor the boy banker had
was a man who wanted to sell a $1,000 New York
City bond._ Bob bought it, after calculating the
interest to date and adding it to the price of the

. bond, which was worth a small premium. There

' wasn't much in the transacti_on, because the boy

knew he’d have to sell it to a broker or banker
as soon as he needed the money, as he did not
look’ for a customer to call for it very soon. That
was one of the disadvantages of running such 9.
‘ business on a small capital. Of course, he had
‘ about $15,000 still on deposit by a few old stand-
! bys‘ who had stuck by Barry, but this he dared
.._*not use with the same freedom as the banker
had done, because he could not tell but these

»i“ depositors might all decide to close out their a_c-
« ' counts assoon as they heard about the change in
'. the ownership of the bank. Bob, armed _with a
 special letter prepared by Barry for the purpose,
" to call on these depositors that after-
‘ noon. '-
‘ f‘fHé asked each for a continuance of his busi-
‘ness; but told them that if they wished to with-

 
 

, to honor their check for their balance. Most
'of .‘ the customers were non-committal as to

V ' whether they would continue with Bob or not. but

. by tlieend of -the ﬁrst week none had closed-'out

 . his account, which Bob thought encouraging. On
 Saturday afternoon, after Billy and the cashier
"had gone, Bob looked over the unusuallylarge
7 quantity of old ‘gold and silver, trinkets, chains,
etc., ~wh'ich‘Mr. Willoughby, who was an expert
at-this

stuff, two pieces of old jewelry that had some-

 ‘how got stuck together, and had been weighed

 in that shape, fel apart, and to Bob’s surprise,

" :3‘. ﬁne, two‘-carat diamond rolled out. The boy,

after examiningthe stone, critically estimated its

value at $225. , ' '

- ' Clearly '.as~the. case stood, he was in that
.’amount of proﬁt extra, for it was quite impossible
to,‘ say;from whom the.two_ pieces of jewelry had

, —. come.’ Such awindfall as that did notioften hap-

qpen", and‘ it was all the more appreciated on ac-

.count of its rarity. After that, business went

along! on a pretty satisfactory basis for a month,

without anything unusual transpiring. Business
eemed to be picking up in the money exchange

ke‘i;, who wanted to see him. . ‘ ~ ‘

_Capta1n Bowker, eh? 'Sh0W him in’ l_31lly,’j_ .
said Banker Bob. . ' . V

The oﬂice boy ushered the visitor into the pri- 7
vate room. He was a short, portly-looking man, - p l
clad in a blue suit, the jacket double-breasted 3 ,
and ornamented with thick brass buttons“ A_' 
cloth cap completed.his attire. ‘I-Iisha/nds, and_ 
as much of his face as was not smothered in an Q
overgrowth of black whiskers, were tanned the
color_ of mahogany. Clearly his calling was a «
nautical one, for he looked the bluff sailor, all » '
over. - . ‘ "

“How do you do, sir? Take a seat,” said Bob, ‘ 
pointing to a chair beside his desk. “I believe - ‘
you are Captain Richard Bowker.” .

.1 “That is my name,” replied, the captain, seat-
ingvliimself. “May I ask if you are Robert Hon-
ner. , «

“Yes, sir; I am Robert Honner.” - -

“I judge by the sign on the door that Banker’
Mark Barry is out of business,” said the cap- ,
tain, with a trace of anxiety in his voice. "if;

“-Yes, sir; but the business is going on just‘  ~

-the same.” J

“Iferhaps_ it’s all right, then,” said the captain, _
looking relieved. _“I’ve brought a letter of intro- " ,
duction to Banker Barry from Lazard Fret-es, 
bankers, Marseilles, France, and a draft ‘on him ._ 
for 15,000 francs.” ,- v , 3 4

“You may present your letter to me, captain. ', 
I have been expecting you.” ~ - p 
_ “Then there will [be no~_diﬁ,’-iculty about the
draft?” said Captain Bowker, drawing the letter
and thepdraft from 9’. hugepbcketbook and pre;
sunning them tovthe boy. I .

“I guess not, captain,” smiled Bob, taking th
‘enclosure from the unsealed envelope and glanc- ~
mg over it. . .:_';,
‘\ It was the usual stereotyped letter of i_ntroduc- . 3?
tion, ufritteii in English, commending the bearer, , Q
Captain Richard Bowker, of the bark Windsor 
Castle, to the consideration of Banker Barry, and’ * :‘
stating that the captain was the bearer of a draft’ 
for -5,000 francs ($3,000), the duplicate of which
and funds to meet saine, would have been received 
by,Mr. Barry some time before Captain Bowker, "‘

vreaclied New York. ‘ =

f‘I am happy to know you, Captain Bowker.” 
said Bob, holding out his hand to the skipper, ‘ ’
wl_io.was clearly an Englishman. “Mr. Barry re-~
ceived a letter of advice from Lazard Freres just
before he retired. from a business and turned it‘
over to me. . Excuse me a moment.” ,-

Bob went outside, and asked~the,cashier to get"
hazard _F_reres’ letter out of a certain drawer.
' in the safe. Mr. Willoughby found the letter and
lifcinded it to the young banker,’ who returned’ to
his private rom. . The letter contained a pretty ac-
curate personal description of the captain" his
signature on a slip of paper, and a duplicate copy,
of the_ draft according to custom.. Bob fhalided
Captain *_B‘owker_;_a pen and a sheet of paper, and“?
asked him to sign hisfname. ‘The captain-did;
so,_and the young banker compared it withthef

1 “Do you wish tofcollect the {full amodnt ‘of:

The captain said thathe would prefer to de-
posit‘/it for the present.
,_ “Very well,” replied Bob.
, you like to have now?”
“I ‘should like about one hundred pounds’:
“'You mean $500, captain,” said the boy, with
' a smile. “One hundred pounds English money is
equivalent to about $_485 in A_m_ci'ican currency.’f\
_ ‘ Captain Bowker said that $300 was about what
-2”  he meant, but ‘not being very familiar with the
_American standard, he had unconsciously, men-
tioned pounds. 1 _
“Well, I will accept you as a depositor to the
amount of your draft, which you will please en-
dorse.” _ _ , 3 _

v ‘Captain Bowker dined with Banker Bob, and
seemed to take a great fancy to the boy. “ "

' “You are young to be a. banker,” he said. You
Americans are a most remarkable people. You
start out for yourselves at an early age and reach
, your goal long before the rest of us are more
- than half way on the road.” _ -

“That’s because we believe in _the2“g‘et-there-

for I guess my little girl has sent one ashore
 long ago on the lookout for me.”
B’ ‘1‘)I’ll see you as far as the ferry, captain,” said
0 . .
“Thank you. That’s kind of you.”
They boarded a Broadwaycar and were soon
at the Staten Island ferryhouse, where a boat
was just on the point of starting for the island.
“I’ll drop in and see you, in a day or two, Mr.
Honner,” said the skipper, grasping the hand of
the young banker. “I reckon we’ll be docked some-
I ‘where along South Street by Thursday, and then
I shall want you to pay us a visit. My daugh-
ter will be glad to know you, and she’ll try and

“Good-night, Captain Bowker.”
The skipper hurried aboard the ferry-boat with
' "that peculiar rolling gait characteristic of the
, sea’, while Bob mounted the stairs of the elevated
- terminal at South Ferry, and took a train up-
town. Bob was pleased to think that he had a
. new depositor, though he was onl a temporary

on,” said the person who claimed the name of
Pinkerton. V ‘ , ~ \’

“Let me see them,” said Bob. _ ,

The man pulled a package out of his pocket I
and produced from it ﬁve $1,000 bonds of the
C. & 0. road. The market value of these bonds
was $1,020, consequently, the ﬁve were worth, not
including accrued interest, $5,100. Bob examined
them and saw that they were all right. Still, ‘as
the man was a complete stranger to him, he could
not tell if he had a legal right to hypothecate the
securities. It was necessary that the young bro-
ker should protect himself, for if it should be
subsequently shown that the bonds had been stol-
en, or obtained by trickery, Bob’ would have to
surrender the bond on demand of their rightful
owner, and his ony chance of recovering any
money he loaned on them would be to proceed
against this man Pinkerton, if he could ﬁnd him. ..

“Are these your bonds, Mr. Pinkei-ton?”~he' ~
asked.

The sanctimonious gentleman assured him that
they were. ‘ , V _

“From whom did you buy them?” ’ ‘ .’ ,

“My uncle, the Rev. Ichabod Moss, of Hilltown ' ‘
Indiana, willed them to me some time ,ago,’
drawled the visitor.

“I suppose you can refer to some responsible "
person in this citywho will identifyyou?”

“Ahem! I am a stranger in New York."

“Then I am afraid I cannot loan you anything
on these bonds.” V . _ _

‘_‘They’re all right‘, ain’t they?” said the visitor, _
quickly, in»: different tone. ‘ ‘ ‘

‘Oh, yes‘ they're all right. Each bond has a
giatrket va ue of $1,020, plus the interest to

a e. v . .

“Then what is your objection to loaning, say
half their _face value? I need the money.” ~ !

“I require at least some reasonable assurance
that the bonds_ are rightfully your roperty.”

“Do you think I stole them?” emanded the
sanctimonious“visi_tor, angrily. ’ ‘

“_I am not insinuating any such thing; but in a
business matter of this kind it is not prudent to
take any chances.” , _ ‘ , .

“You. are not taking any chances. The bonds ’
belong to mel’  . " *

“I assume that they do, but I regret that your
bare word, for remember, you are a stranger to.
me, is not sufficient evidence of the fact,” replied ._
Bob, as politely as possible. ' y , 

"Then you won’t advance any money on them?" i

“If I knew you, I should be glad to do so,‘ but
under the circumstances, I regret that I cannot
do so.” I e ' . 1

His visitor wrapped the bonds up again,‘but‘ I .7
not before Bob had made a mental note of their \ 2
numbers,, and the ‘name of the person in ‘whose ' 5
name they stood, which he had seen was not .
Ichabod Moss. He didn’t.1ike Mr. “ Pinnertorfa‘
face", not his general make—up. He, had a strong‘
suspicion that Pinkerton was not his visitoi-’s 
right name, and that the man was masquerading 
in .a disguse. Thevvisitor got up, bowed stiﬂ.='ly, 
and left‘ the office. As ;the door closed behind
him, Bob got up and called Billy. * 1 ~

CHAPTER VI.‘--Bob Meets Bessie,Bowker. I

“'5, . While Billy was away, Bob .’phoned the “Stock
Exchange to learn if any C. & 0. bonds had been

reported ‘as stolen or missing. The reply he re-

ceived was that the Exchange had received no

information about stolen or missing C. & O.

’ K bonds. The young banker made inquiries in other

' directions, but without result. If the bondsin

question had been stolen, the fact had not yet

. leaked ‘out. ‘In a few minutes Billy returned with

word that the sanctimonious gentleman had en-

tered the oﬁice of Willcutt & Slewsby, stock bro-
kers, on the ﬂoor below. _

“Well, go downstairs, keep an eye on him and
follow him. If ‘he meets any one on the street,
make a_ mental note of the man, ‘and then come
back.” ' .

 Billy vanished on his errand. .Two hours
I passed, and the office boy was still out. Bob was
preparing to go to lunch, when his telephone
_ rang out. ‘ .
'  “Hello,” he said, putting the receiver to his
ear. ‘

“That you, Mr.‘ Honner,”
Billy.

I » “Yes; is that you, Billy?” _

’ - “Yes, sir. I followed the sanctimonious gent
~ out of the buildin’ and saw him meet a smooth-
? faced man in a business suit, on Nassau and Pine
Streets. I passed ’em and, heard the gent you

_ put me on to, say that it was no go. The other
. man- said he'd take ’em, and the missionary chap
assed him a package. They walked up Nassau
gtreet together and I followed. I shaddered ’em
up Park Row to the Bowery where. they went into

~ ‘ a saloon, and I did too, They had a couple "of
’ drinksat the bar, and’ then went up to Grand
' Street where“ they met another man, who looked
pretty tough. After standin’ there a while, the
‘three Walked down Grand to Orchard, and up to
Broome, and down Broome to the Plaza, where
they took_ a seat on ‘a bench. I sneaked up close

came the» voice of

X '. behind ’em, and pretended to be lookin’ for some-

< thin’ under the seat. They never twigged me, but
‘ went on talkin’. e I heard em speakin’ about some

_ bonds that one of ’em had swiped from a house
uptown last night, along with a lot of other stuff.
The chap with the missionary face said he"d tried
to borrow money on the bonds in Wall ‘Street,
. 1- but he couldn’t make the riffle. He said the per-
,.,- .sonshe’d called on looked at him with suspicion.
’ .He mentioned your name, and said you were a
‘‘ retty ﬂy boy. The chap in the business suit said

‘ he remembered you. He said you were the nervi-
est kid he ever_came acrossythat threemonths

/

 /ago‘ he and a fellow he. called Twitcher had tried '

, ‘to rob thexoﬁice of Banker Barry, and that you
' “ had queered the game though he held‘ a revolver
», , against 'your‘,head. He said he intended to fix
'  on some‘ time ifphe got the chance. I thought the

‘zest thing I could do was to pint a cop on to ’em,
, ‘and, looked aroundifor one. There wasn’t none
yfiii sight, and before ‘one’-showed up the cha s
‘I ..w,alked‘ofE, and I lost track of ’em, so I thoug t
:.II.?d telephone you '1f1‘01n jhis here durgstore.”

told him to hurry back to the office, and then went 
to lunch. Whenhe got back, Billy‘ had just gone , '
out on an errand for the cashier. Later on, "my" 
repeated his story to Bob with more detail. , The 1 .
young broker communicated with police hea.dquar- I
ters, described the visit 5to his oﬁice of the tall,
thin man, who gave his name as Pinkerton,,and
gave the result of Bil1y’s detective tactics.

Half an. hour later a detective called on Bob,
and had a talk with him. Billy was called into
the room, and,went over his story once more. v
The sleuth said that the allegedyrobbery uptown, : '
in which the bonds ﬁgured, according to Billy’—s' 
‘statement, had not been reported to the police as‘ '
yet. Bob furnished the oﬂicer with the numbers-V, ».
of the ﬁve bonds on which Pinkerton had tried to.‘ ‘
raise a. loan, together with the name of «the —p'ei‘.-~ 
son to whom the‘—bonds were made out, and the‘ J
detective went away. About half~past three on" »
the following day, Captain Bowker walkedinto; 4
the office again, and Billy, showed him into the,’
private room. 3 « * _ ' 

-«.“Glad ‘to see you,’ captain,” saidlBob as they 
shook hands. “Is your bark docked yeti” , - u ‘j ,

“We hauled in at Pier 11, to-day, and I’ve come —
to take you aboard to dinner. We usually dine’, at ;
noon, but as I didn’t suppose that hour would suit _'
you, I had the order of things changed. We.dine',
at sixto-day, and I take it, you won't refuse to.
honor my humble mahogany withyour presence.-
At any rate, I told Bessie she might expect you;
and I suppose she’ll put on a few extra frills for’
the occasion.” - , ,

Thusxspoke the blliﬂ’ skipper, and Bob saw that 2'
he could.n’.t.very well refuse the invitationp At “
any rate, it wouldn't be good policy to run the 
risk of oﬁending his new depositor, so Bob said 
he'd come. The captain’s reddish-brown face, 
shone with satisfaction through» is whiskers, and ' ‘
he said he'd wait outside till t e young bankerf
was readyto leave the office. It was nearly four 3
by the‘ time Bob and Captain Bowker turned ‘I-
down Wall Strett toward the East-"River. As’
Pier 13 was at the foot of Wall Street, they had
not a’ great way to go.  f 5'1

In less than half an hour they were mounting’
the steps that led to the deck of the Windsor
Castle, a. vessel which looked as if she had seen
plenty of service "on the briny ocean. Captain“
Bowker led the way into the cabin, passing‘
through a narrow passage with two doors on‘
either side. ‘ One of these stood partly open, and,
Bob caught a glim se of. the pantry, with the
steward at work. The next moment they weregin:
1:-he cabin, and». the young banker caughta glimpse:
of a vision in pink and. white, seated‘ on a lou I
between the doors of two .staterooms.. . ‘ __

‘,‘Bessie,” said‘ Captain Bowker, “this is ‘_“M

As Bob bowedwpolitelyto the vision he discoir,-‘
er_ed that she was a very pretty, fair-hairedgi-r ‘
with a glowingcolor on her cheeks that Shaina,

Astor, House, I’m afraid I was just as anxious

', ‘ ‘‘I’ll leave you to entertain Mr. I-Ionner,” said
the skip‘ er to his daughter. “I’ve got some busi-
., ness wit Mr. I-lemming.” '
; _‘* ’ Mr. Hemming was the chief mate, and he was
 ondeck, somewhere forward. "
“I'll do the best I can, papa,” she answered.
- Bob soon found that she was able to hold her
\  part in the conversation. She seemed to be very
well educated, and was a bright, vivacious talker.
.Sl'ie'was different from most girls that Bob knew,
*-"and. appeared to be quite unconscious of the im-
pression she was making on the young banker.
Their tete-a-tete had lasted about half an hour
when the steward came into the cabinto set. the
table, whereupon Bessie suggested that they ad-
journito the deck above,""wh_ere they took posses-
* sion of a couple of camp chairs. it was now after
., .§ve, and the stevedores had quit work for the
day. The west side of South Street,‘ lined with
’ , old-fashioned, three and four story ‘buildings, was
' alive with pedestrians and loungers, presenting
' . an animated appearance. The only buildings on
the water side of the whole thoroughfare were

.,the long stunted freight-houses on some of the_

 piers, sandwiched in between a_ forest of shipping,

‘whosetop-hamper glistened with the light of the

'77 and he did not waste much ‘attention on the lat-

nounced that dinner was on the table. They went
down into .-‘the cabin at once,_where they found
Captain Bowker and his chief mate, to‘ whom Bob
“was introduced, already at the table. After the
meal, Bob, Miss ‘Bessie’ and the skipper went in

' CHAPTER VI‘I.——How the Unexpected’ Saves Bob

Bob escorted the skipper of the Windsor"Castie
and his daughter to a Broadway theatre on the
following. evening, and took them to su per after-.
ward. He then called a cab and had em taken ’
back to the bark. Before they arted company,
Bob invited them to dine at his ome on Sunday
afternoon, and make the acquaintance of his
mother and sister. They agreed to come, and Bob
furnished the captain with his address, which
was within easy reach of the Third Avenue ele-
vated road. When Bob opened up his paper next
morning, the ﬁi-st thing he saw was the account A _
of a big robbery in a Madison Avenue residence. I’
The family had been away in the countiryfor a
week, and during their absence the house had
been entered by crooks and retty well cleaned
out. A wall-safe had been lown open, and in 
addition to silver, plate and valuablejewelry,
ﬁve C. & 0. $1,000 first mortgage bonds had been
stolen.. The numbers of these were published,
and the boy identiﬁed them as the ones presented
at his office by the sanctimonious Mr. Pinkerton
as security for a loan. , .

“It's lucky that I refused to take any chances ,
with those bonds, otherwise I would be out and ,
injured to the extent of_ the loan,” thought the
young banker, after ﬁnishing the story of the
robbery. “As no arrests have been made in con- ,
nection with the crime, it does not appear that the -
police have turned the clues I gave them to any '
advantage. I'd like to see that smooth-faced chap.
who held the revolver to my head in the oﬁce »'
three months ago, pulled in. Of course, I couldn’t . , V

‘prove anything against him, but it would give me "

a whole ‘lot of satisfaction to see him sent up the
river for somethingelse. However, he.’s bo V ‘-
to’ see his ﬁnish some time. Those kind of chaps ‘ ‘
always do, sooner or later.” ' ;
Although it was Saturday and a short business
day, it was 'a‘ sort of red letter one in Bob's cal- .
cndar, for he secured three new depositors for his j
banking department‘. They were all Pearl Street”
business men, and their combined initial deposits
amounted to about $12,000. This bit of good for-
tune, which augured so well for his future, was 
so‘ unexpected that Bob held a quiet jubilation _ ,
meeting all by himself in his private room, after , v_
the cashier and the office boy had gone away for =‘~*.‘v
the day. The $12,000, with about $6,000 more, ‘-
was in a small,‘ tin box on his desk‘,~which hein-Q " ,
tended to take to his safe-deposit vault on his way 
to lunch. While he was ﬁguring up his proﬁts ,

1 for the week, which showed a satisfactory balance \

in his favor, two men entered the outer office. One,
was the smooth-faced man in the businesssuit, -
who had held Bob up ‘with his revolver three ‘:_
months. _before, while the voter was the tall, thin ' ‘
man, with the sa’ c’ onious countenance, who

 

had. called a fewv aysbefore to raise moifeyon 5

the five stolen C._&~(_). bonds. He didii’t looklike ‘
a. missionary this time, but had on different
disguise; that of a well-to’-do Englishman, ins
light tweed suit and Dundreary whiskers.‘  1
Both men carfied grips. After»a.sharp glance",
around “the ofﬁce, ‘with its closed safe and 111100‘-
cupied, desks behind the brass railing, they pa 
down their grips‘ and advanced to the closeddb‘

4 to ﬁnd sombody inxthere, and that somebody, of
. course, the young banker.’ That their intentions
»’were dishonest; could not be doubted, and the fact
"that they _were runninga great risk did not seem

‘V ’ ftly turning the handle‘ of.~’the door of the
private room, the manwith the smooth face open-
ed it airinch or two, ‘and looked in. He noted
‘with satisfaction that’ the boy, as he sat at his
desk by the window, was absorbed in his work,
i " and that until he looked up, -the back‘bf the ‘desk
‘ ' wouldcover their entrance. Gripping his com-
" panion’s arm as‘ a signal that all was serene, the
twopcrooks walked quickly into the room. Before
i. Bob‘ realized the situation, the smooth-faced ras-
' cal gripped him by the throat and jerked him out
' . of his seat on to the ﬂoor. Yanking‘{_a' slung—shot
out ofhis pocket, the fellow ﬂashed it before the
‘boy's eyes and hissed: . » .
- “We’ve got you dead to rights, young ‘fellow,
_ this time. Utter a single yaw and this persuad-
 'er will make a dent in yours ull/that will mark
0 . your ﬁnish. It makes no noise, and is just as
' ' effective as a bullet. Now, then, we want the
 « combination to your safe, outside.” '
“ j As a gentle remindérof what was in store for
 him if. he thwarted them, the man with the
smooth face tapped Bob on the temple with the
; 7 hard, round end‘ of the slung-shot, and the con-
- tact was decidedly unpleasant. Bob knew that he
-was at the mercy of the two intru ers. On the
desk, lay the tin box with $18,000, belonging to
’ ‘his de ositors, more than the total amount of his
‘capital’. ; Not" over $1,500 in money and other
articles ‘ofvalue lay in the safe. His life was

his eyes and ﬁngered his weapon impatiently. The

of value out of it. Bessie looked very serious

while he told his story, and sympathized with him  ~

in a charming way that added to the warm opin- _
ion he already had of her. The janitor’s assist-.  .

ant, who had gone downstairs to wait, for the #3,,’

policemen, and__ guide them to the office, had 

notiﬁed the janitor and the supenintendent of the
state of affairs in Banker Honner’s oﬁice, and
thetwo persons speedily put in an appearance. 

While Bob was explaining things to them,’ the 

police arrived and.han_dcuffed the crooks. The

young banker _was told’ that it would be neces-
sary for him to go to the station to make the
charge, and the captain said that he and .his ".
daughter would accompany him. The officers took -
the prisoners away in the wagon, and Bob, Cap: xi 
tain Bowker and Bessie followed on foot: Bob ’ "
was told that the prisoners would be brought be; ' —,
fore the magistrate of the Tombs Police Court on - ,»
the ‘following _morning._for examination, and that

he and his witnesses would. have to be present to
«press the charge. After leaving the station, the_

young banker, expressed his regret to the captain

and his‘ daughter, that it was necessary for them ~
to appear in the police court to give their evi— 
dence at the examination. ' 
_ ,“Don’t worry about that, Mr. Honner,” replied

C Captain Bowker. “We shall be glad to helpalong ,
the good work of -giving those rascalstheir just’. '
deserts. ‘We shall consider it a favor if you will - 
call for us on board the bark, as we might find

some difficulty in reaching the police court by ,our- '  V

selves?’ , , , . .

“I will call for you between half-past nine and » 

ten. And, now instead of: going to your vessel, '7-
I suggest that you let me -take you both up to J ‘

.“I don’t"believe I can go,", said the captain,’ .

V “As papa »1S willing, I shall be glad to,” she ans ', ‘

*‘ lonesome after you have sailed away.” =

  

, Bessie nodded as though that was her opinion,
too. Then they branched off on to other topics.
Bob told her how he had worked for Banker
Barry for ﬁve years, before he succeeded to the

W‘ business about two months since,‘ and how he ex-
’ pected to make a big success of his venture.

"I’ve already done much better than I expect-
ed,” he said. “’And I look to see things improve
right along as times grow better.” ‘

“Paga said you looked very young to be a bank-
er, an at first he had some doubts about leaving
his money on deposit with you. But the longer
hetalked with you, the more he liked you, and
realized how bright and smart you are, so that

all‘his doubts faded away.” V

"He need not fear about his money. He can
draw the whole of it any day he wants to, for

' the cash is in the bank to meet his check. By the
way, I call this one of my lucky days in spite of
the narrow escape I had from those crooks, for

I secured three new depositors this morning. That

shows you I'm getting on.”  ~ _

' “Papa won’t want his money until the bark is

ready to ‘return to England, and that probably

won’t be for a month}: ‘ “ I >
“I wish you were going to remain longer, here.

I’ve taken a great liking to you, and shall feel
. “Why, how absurd!” blushed Bessie. “Just as
if I was of so much importance.”

f‘Youzf father thinks you the most important
person in the world. You don’t know, but the

k l feelings is catching,” laughed Bob.

Bob wound up the afternoon by taking Bessie to
the art gallery, after’which he saw that she got
back to the’ bark all right, and remained to tea
on board the vessel. 0 '

/Bob, Captain.Bowker and his daughter were
present next morning in the Tombs Police Court
when «the two crooks were brought before the bar.

'~ The prisoners, who gave their names as John
Griiﬁn and Len Hood, pleaded not guilty. Bob
then‘ took the »_stand and told his story, after

‘ . which the captain and his daughter testified. The
magistrate remanded the prisoners for the ac-

took them up to his house -where he introduced
them to his mother and sister. The two girls

pleased Bob immensely. After dinner, Bob,,Bes-

' Grace carried ‘Bessie off to her room to show her
’ private treasures, wearing‘ apparel, and other
, things that girls like to exhibit to one another.

“Don’t pay any attention to him, Bessie,” said
Grace. “Boys are an awful nuisance around the
house, don’t you think?” ‘ ‘ ‘ ,

Bessie declined to commit herself on the subject,
favoring,Bob with one of her sidelong glances
that increased his admiration for her. The three
were laughing and chatting gaily when the clock
struck nine, and Captain Bowker remarked that
it was time for Bessie and himself to returnoto
the bark. Bob offered to accompany them, but
the skipper said it wasn’t necessary for him to
go all the way downtown. ‘

“You may see us to the elevated station, their ,

we’ll be all right, for a South Ferry train will ‘ :
land us at Hanover Square, from which .-it is‘ but 

a short walk to Pier 11,” said the captain. , ,
Bob saw that they got the right train, and
promised Bessie that he would take tea with her .
and her father on Tuesday night. Next morning ’

Bob sold his ﬁrst foreign draft.,, It called for p '

1,000 florins, equivalent to a little more than
$370, and he made it out on his Budapest corre-,
spondent in’Austra-Hungary, the ‘city where his 2
customer was bound for. Healso sold the man
a few [English soverigns, and French gold, for
use on his‘ way. That day also marked his first

call loan of $5,000 to a broker on the same floor; / 1' V
After that he had frequent applications for loans,-

but had to turn most of them down, owning to‘
lack of capital. ,In order to try and give hisi
banking department a boost, he got out a-_ neat

four-page booklet and sent it around to all the ‘

small tradesmen in theneighborhood. On Tues- 
day afternoon, when he left his office to take f

tea aboard the Windsor Castle he was ‘followed,

On the following afternoon, th same young man

to take Bessie and his sister to the theatre on the » 

following evening. . _
After the show, the ’captain’s daughter was to
go home with them and stay all night at his

house with Grace, returning to thebark in the 
morning with Bob.‘ About half—past‘four, Bob 
left the office, went -to Pier 11 and escorted Bessie 2

 BANKER l§ARi%Y’S‘ BOY‘

and it was put through after Bob had communi— .

cated with the government storehouse and found
out that everything was all right.

Although the deposits had little more than
doubled since Eob assumed controlof the busi-

ness, most of which he‘had~out on call loans at

’ ‘ a, ﬂuctuating, butxproﬁtable rate of interest, he
didn’t begin to have capital enough to meet all
the demands made upon him. Brokers who had

' , traded with Banker B.'J.l‘1'y were constantly com-

ing in to raise a loan on gilt-edge‘ securities, and-

the boy had to turn them down as a rule, be-
cause he seldom had available funds enough to
accommodate them. ,
'  I “If I had $100,000‘ at my back, I could put out
every cent of‘ it,’’, he told his cashier.
_ * “I guess you could do that,” nodded old Mr.»
.Willouﬁhby. “Once on a time, Mr. Barry had
', more t an that much out on good collateral. But
» since hard times reduced his depositors and their
balances, he scarcely had out over $60,000. You
are doing remarkably well, though, not only to
hang on to the old guard of depositors, but to
2 get several" new ones. I think it is only a matter
of time, when you’ll build up a big business.”
That afternoon as he was returnin 'to his
office after lunch, he noticed a very plainly
dressed little old Woman start to. cross Wall
T_ Street from the corner of Broad. At that mo-
‘. inent a heavy express-wagon dashed around the
"corner of Nassaii Street into Wall, at a pretty
_ ~tidy clip. Av. cab and an automobilewere tom-
ing up Wall, from the direction‘ of Pearl Street.
, The old woman had her eyes on tlggcab and
the auto, but did. not notice the ‘express-wagon
till the horses were almost on top of her. Over-
come by terror, she stood /roo‘te,d.'to ‘the spot,
..and would_have been run ‘down but for Bob's
presence of mind. /He took in the situation at a’
‘glance, and dashed forward. Catching her around

the waist, he swung her out of the path of the‘

wagon, and landedi her in safety on the opposite
sidewalk. It was done so quickly that it attracted
little attention,\ except from the driver; of the
‘ expi-ess—wagon and the chauffeur of the auto.
. ', The little old lady was prett badly demoralized
  the narrow escape she ha had, and she stood
a 1 lof Fa-tremble, gazing at‘ her brave rescuer,
A’ and’ utterly unable to speak a word.
’~  — " ‘‘You’re all right, now, ma’am,” said Bob. “Can

by the sleeve as he started to leave. “What is

“Robert Honner.” . \ y ' V

She took a small memorandum book out of her‘
bag and wrote it down. ,

“You work in this neighborhood, I presume,”
she saidxﬂ , ’ H _—

“Yes, ma’am.”

“For whom?” 

“Myself.” ‘ " -  '

Broadway. Bob looked after her a moment, and
then as he turned toward his omce, a big ‘broker
with whom he was acquainted, slapped him on I
the back. ' —' /' ‘ ' , « 7'

“I know that, but I don’t expect Mrs. Griggs
or anybody else, to furnish it.” . ~
“If she offered to loan you $100,000, without
security, at two percent, which you could put
out at six percent, you «wouldn’t re use the favor,
would you?” , . »

“I’m not ﬁguring on anybody loaning me any

“That is very much like being paid for doing -
one’s duty, and that it something I don’t be-lieveil
in,” replied Bob, turning away and entering his
oﬂice. Next day wassaturday, and Bob had a
date with Bessie Bowker for the afternoonn. He
intended to take her to Bronx Park, andshow
her the sights up there. {I'hen she was to take
dinner with the Honners, and afterward go‘ with

téered the private oﬁioe and announced Mrs.’ ,-

“ how her in, Bill’,” said Bob, quite tickled
that the little old la _y had honored himlwithia

air, as if he was conferring a favor upon her, for  —._

1' plain attire and unpretentious manner did 
not greatly impress him. ’ _ I  y 

I “Pleased to see you, Mrs. Griggs,” said Bob.  ;
rising and advancing to meet her. ' -

give you an early call to express more suitably

 

life, yesterday,” said the old lady, seating her- ‘_’
self beside his desk. ' ‘ «
"“I hope .you won’t think of thanking me any f

“I presume you would accept me as one of the
two hundred?” '

“I should be ‘delighted; It would give my busi-
ness a boost if it was known that I had your

“Well, I will become one of your depositors,

come known, if you think it will beneﬁt you.”

if the little old lady intended becoming a customer
of the oﬂice. Mrs. Griggs laced her well-known
signature, which was goo for a dozen million

‘if attached to a check, in the book. Bob then

‘began ﬁlling in a deposit slip.
“How much shall -I put down?” he said, look-

‘- ‘ing at his visitor inquiringly. Mrs. Griggs open-

fed her bag, and took out a check, made payable

-to the youii «banlter’s order. It was drawn on
‘the lady’s principalbank, the Manhattan National,

' "and called for $100,000., Bob gave a ‘gasp when

“he saw the amount.

“Have you really $100,000 worth of conﬁdence
in me, Mrs. Griggs?” he asked, eagerly.

in rising. vARer breakfast, Bob appeared before
the magistrate of the nearest district court, and
_ ‘swore out warrants against Dr. Rutherford Bown
’ " and-John Griffin. Both_were arrested during the
«day, and Bob and Bessie appeared against them
in court on Monday morning. The letter written
by Griffin to Doctor Brown, which Bob had taken
charge of, was deemed suﬂicient to hold both men,
and: they were remanded. _ 4

gave him ‘an order on his cashier fozxthe money,
less the amount of duty demanded by the ‘gov-
ernment, which he paid tothe proper oﬂicial, and
took the stuff away. The solid silver casket, dam-
aged as it was, took the young banker's eye. It ’
seemed to be unusually heavy, considering ’it size.

Left alone, Bob took it up to return it to the big
safe outside, when in handling it he accidentally
pressed hard upon one of. the four corner pro-
jecting knobs. Instantly a shallow drawer sprang
out of what proved to be a false bottom of the
casket. The drawer was literally crammed with _a
collection of diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and .
other gems of the purest water that had been
concealed there. The discovery fairly paralyzed
the young banker. He dumped the collection out
and examined the various gems with care. He
soon came to the conclusion that they were the
jewels that had originally adorned the casket. A
rough estimate of their value convinced the boy
that they were worth close on to $100,000. He
was greatly excited over the‘ remarkable discov-
ery.

Replacingthe casket in the safe, he 'carr'ed the
gems to his safe-deposit box. On Monday ie‘sub-
mitted them to the judgment of an expert in

precious stones who -estimated their wholesale . i

value at $90,000. After setting aside half la
dozen of the stones, which he intended to have
set for his mother, sister and futurebride, Bes-
sie, he disposed _of the balaiice for $80,000. This‘
he added to his business capital, and made him
worth about $100,000. Broker Barry returned to
New York after an absence of twenty months,
and when he called on Bob. he wasaastonished to

_find what a successful business the young’ banker

had built up, since the day he started on an
actual capital of but $5,000. He found Bob in
lar_er quarters, with several clerks. be:-i<l_es, Mr.

“How did you do it?" asked the amazed Barry,

boat pulled ashore from the schooner containing
Hazeltine and three or four of the men.

The captain went to one of the houses, remained
come little time, and then, as he came toward the
boat, called to Clif, whom Tom had ‘now joined.

“Come here, my boy,’

It's quieter out there.

he said. “I want you. I
’ll go out to the schooner.

Clif was disa pointed at having to leave Ada,

but he did not

schooner. ‘

warning, some one suddenly rushed upon him and ‘
dragged him from the rail. V _

He sat at the table, poured out a glassful_of
liquor, lighted-a cigar, and settled down to'enJoy
himself.

“He may have been playing possum before,”
thought Clif, “or he may have been asleep and
was awakened. I’ll have to make sure this time.”

After a considerable time, when it had become,
quiet in the cabin, the boy opened his eyes a little
and saw that the clock on the rear partition was
in his line of vision, and that the captain’s eyes
were closed, and his hand was at his’ side, al-
though he still held the cigar between his lips.

A tiny wreath. of smoke curled up from the ‘end \
of the cigar, and Clif doubted if the man were
really asleep.

He closed his own eyes quickly, after notic-’
ing that it was nearly midnight. _

He waited to hear the ship's bell strike, but
when at least ten minutes had passed and there
was no sound he concluded that the men ‘on deck
were asleep.

Time passed, and then Hazeltine moved un-
easily, snared, changed his position, half awoke,
and then dropped to sleep again, with his head on
his arms, which were stretched out in .front of
him on the table. ‘ _ .

Clif waited anotherihour, and then. hearing’ no
sound on deck, raised himself slowly and quietly,
put his feet on the ﬂoor, and at last stood up.

Hazeltine was asleep, but Clif knew not how
soon he might awaken. ' _

He glided across the cabin, and out by a rear
door‘ leading to therooms of the officers and the
steward’s pantry, and then up a short companion- ‘. ,
way to the cockpit. . . - ‘

He reached this in a few moments, glanced v '
across the quarter-deck, and noticed that the ves-

I

- sel’s head was now pointed \.toward the shore, and p
, knew thatthe tide had changedand was running

out. ~

He could see no one on .deck, hear no sound, ,
and, resolving to lose no time, slipped o‘ve'r the
taﬂrail, hung by his arms an instant, and V.
dropped. V _ , V v '

There was a splash, but when he came to the
surface after swimming the length of the vessel
under water he heard no alarm from the deck '
and saw no one. .= '

The tide was against him, but he swam on

steadily, and made good progi-esga reaching the

beach at last, and sitting on the nd in the lee
of one of the boats to rest and get his breath.

There was no sound‘ from the cabins, and all. ,

CHAPTER XI.
Captain Hazeltine In Pursuit.

The moon was well down toward the hills, the
tide ﬂowed strong and steady to the-sea, and all
was still on shore and on the Marv Ann when
the boat containing the four adventurers put out
from the beach. _

'I‘om had secured a small keg of fresh water,
another containing bread and meat. a lantern,
two or three light blankets. a hatchet. some nails,
and a few fathoms of light line. He also got a
double-barreled pistol, several rounds of ammuni-
tion, and a.box of percussion caps. ~

There were four oars in the boat, but no mast
or sail, although. Tom thought he had provided
grfboth of these, and presently said as much to

i.. _ I
’ “Yes, they ought to do first-rate.” said Clif-,

' “and it was well you thought of the blankets. In

any event, they will keep us warm if the night
grows chilly.”

Clif helped Ada and her father into the boat,

,.,and then he and Tom shoved oﬂ’, jumping in as

they glided into deep water.

Not a sound showed that their esczfpe had been
discovered, and, picking up the oars while Tom
topk his place at the tiller, Clif pulled with Quiet.
steady strokes, being careful to make no more

i noise than was absolutely necessary‘.

“Y-ou-’re sure you know the place, Tom?” asked
Clif inga‘ low tone, when, looking over his shoul-
der, he saw they were close to a range of hills
which seemed to bar their further progress.

“I- guess so," said Tom. “Anyway. the tide is
tal<in' us along.— ;You pull steady and I'll put you

Clif rowed steadily, and presently. looking up,
he said: ‘  '

“Hallo! I can’t see the beach any more. We

 must have turned.”

“I! guess we have. \There’s rocks just ahead of
us, butyou keep on pullin’ an’ I’1l steer."
In ‘a few minutes Clif looked up again, and saw

V that -the schooner had disappeared, and that they

were gliding through a sort of strait with green

hills on both sides.

v .

At times they lost sight of‘ the moon, and
drifted on in the shadow of great black rocks or

green ﬁelds, w ‘ch ‘descended at a sharp angle

right to thepwa r’s edge, and were without shore
or beach of any kind. ‘

4, .' Then they seemed to be rushing right upon
rocks, but Tom, by a quick movement of the tiller

would glide by in safety, the current bearing them

I s swiftly on toward new dangers, which the boy
_ avoided at the vnment they threatened most.‘

- Presently they were_caught in a cross-current,
the boat rocked (rightfully, - and shipped some
water, but Tom ealled to Clif to keep, rowing

with -all his miﬁt, and soon, when it seemed-
as if they in-ustﬂbe swamped or go upon the rocks,»

they shot into'a_li1oad expanse of water, beyond

Y ‘which they saw the ocean, lighted by the rays of

the declining moon. . y ’ . A

_darkest'hour befire the dawn, whenall was still

"and the darkness, was so. intense that they- could

“There’s_little danger of being run down by
vessels, ’ said Clif. “but we are not in the opensea
yet, and there may be rocksor. shoals about. i It

spot until daybreak. but we ought to get as far
as possible from the island before our esccape
is discovered.” ‘ p’ 
“Better keep on,_” said Tom. “We’1l light th ,
lantern and stick ‘It on an oar. That’ll help, us
some, an’ it ain’t ‘likely they know we've left yet."
The lantern was lashed to the shaft of an‘oa

thwart. . .

i  THE CAPTURE‘ AND

 THE ESCAPE

By HORACE APPLETON.

*'l‘wenty-ﬁve years ago important mails were"
carried from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento.

by a‘ postal system called the pony-rider express.
"There were eighty riders and four hundred
ponies in this service. ' . .

The‘ rider whose adventures I am about to re-
late was a rather diminutive man, weighing about
one hundred and ‘ten pounds, and was known on

i '  {the route as Chubby. -

' .At ten o’cl-ock one dark niirht, while going west,

through'central Kansas. he arrived at Steel Plate, _

one of the change stations. ..

V The mail agent at the station informed him that
the Indians had raided a settlement about three
miles south of the trail, between that point and
Black ,Kettle,. the next station, and had cut off
cominunication, between the two places, and that
the mail carrier, who shouldhave reached Steel
Plate that day from the west,)had not been heard

from‘.

He also informed Chubby‘that.»the-rideij who”
. had reached Steel Platethe day before had not

dared to make‘ the trip between there and Black

 Kitt,le- until his (Chubby’s) arrival. 

.-_“Who is he?” Chubby in ired. .
“It‘s Johnny Scully,” rep ied the agent.
Cl.-iibby laughed. - .
. Scully, was a big, red-headed ‘Irishman, the'tall-
est man on the line.

He talked in a deep bass voice, wore ﬁerce whis-’ _ ‘

kers, and looked like a man whom a whole tribe
of Indians might try in vain to intimidate.

‘ “Where is little Jo'hnny‘.”’ Chubby _asked. “If
he’s going to ride to Black»Kettle with me, he's
go€ to be ready inside of five minuutes.” I '

Scullywas found. and he tried hard to dissuade

Chubby from undertaking the perilous ride.

"But the little fellow was obdurate, and ﬁnally
Scully ‘got upo‘n his/.hors,e, with a very ill grace,
a'nd’both set out for Black Kettle. ' ' .

- The night was dark when they started, much
to the satisfaction of both of. them; for if the red-
‘ skins -were abroad, darkness was‘ their only safe-

Y. , , ‘7 . .

I The steel whichscully bestrode was a spirited
Morgan, who minded his weight as nothing, while

‘ Chubby’s was one of the best on the line—a Royal

George stallion.

 g xlioth animals were used to the road, and can-
‘ ‘tered briskly through the darkness with sure-

iooted speed. , y,
,» . The riders had proceeded but a few miles, how-

ever, when the moon rose, casting a bright light

over ‘the smooth‘ prairie beneath them, every spot.

hissupper, and was then allowed to sleep, his
‘hands and feet being securely tied. . . -
- The next day was a repetition of its predeces-
sor. ~ L .

The Indians kept on toward the south, Chubby
still in charge of the squaw, who fed him at noon
with her ﬁngers. ' - '

The ‘third day a drove of buffaloes made their
appearance at some distance, and braves, pappoo-

_ ses and squaws joinedjin, ahunt, leaving‘Chubby

and his jailress v alone.

The squaw wasanxious to "see the sport, and ‘

she therefore tied her prisoner's tether to a tree, -
and, stillrkeeping him in sight, went a_ little dis- -

\

tance‘ towatch her companions. . ._
Getting interested, she ﬁnally ' left him alto-
gether. . ‘ «’
Now was his chance.
’ He picked the knot which held him to the tre



with his teeth, and by a gymnastic feat brought j ,
his hands over his head. and untied the whipcord ‘,

as he had the other knot. ..

’ He had now only to untie his feet, but his:‘hai.i53n:':'.)l ‘~

and arms were sonumb from conﬁnement that it
was half an’ hour before he could use them. 4 ’ .
_ When at last liberty rewarded‘ his eﬁ’o.rts,' he
crawled on his hands and knees. four or five miles,
until he came to the backtrack of the buffaloes;
where hegknew he would be likely to ﬁnd white
hunters. ’ * ‘ .
He was successful, and ‘met friends the next
morning; " - ’ . ' ,

OF WOMAN UNEARTHED

A further important archaeological discovery‘.

was made during‘ the i demolition of the royal,
