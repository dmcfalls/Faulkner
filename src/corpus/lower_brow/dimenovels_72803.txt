Jessup"s cottage stood, a’ mark for the elements.
when in a pugnacious mood. ~ ,
With a sigh of satisfaction he,saw that he was
leaving the worst of his precarious journey behind
him, and that the way ahead was all plain sailing.
. All he had to do now.was to descend the rocks
By ahcircuitous pathway to reach the hard, level ‘
eac . . '
As he started to do so he suddenly noticed that j 'f,_~‘
there were others abroad if‘! this locality besides. ' ~_ ’
himself. ‘ . . ’ '
_ Coming toward him, along the beach below,_'was .
a bunch of men. j
They reached the path over the rocks that he ‘
was following himself and began to ascend it. ._ ,,
They came on now in single ﬁle, for the waywaai '~
By the conﬁdent manner in which they pursue ‘ 
their route. notwithstanding the darkness and dif-g ‘
ﬁculties of the path, it was apparent that they ‘
were not strangers to the locality.

They did not look once_toward the boy, nor 
‘ pause in hesitation,‘ but walked quickly “and
steadily forward. ' ‘  J

Roy saw that he would have to step aside to let

them pass. ' ._
Either they had not seen the boy, or his pre-, .

  

 

;for the passed within a yard of hinrwithout look-
ing in 's direction. ’ ‘ ‘

*‘ He counted ten well dressed men, whose air be-
tokened that theybelonged to the upper class. , '

Not a_ word fell from their lips as 'they,.,pur-.
sued their way, in Indian fashiongone behind the
other, like so many grim, silent phantoms.’

Roy looked after them, wondering whence they 
had come, until they vanished, one by one, inthe
gloom ahead, and were gone. 7 . h .

He’ left the shelter of the rockand took to the: ' '
downward path again. - c , . .- '
T Walking ahead,’ with each incoming wave almost ~
lapping his shoes, 'heys_&‘ddenly ‘stumbled over a  
yielding ob'ect inhis ‘ath.  T ‘ _ . 6 —

 “It was not the scream of a seagull I heard,

CHAPTER III.—Roy Learns of a Railroad Con-
solidation and Prepares to Proﬁt by It

The inquest over the body of Mr. Deacon was
held in the barn next morning at eleven’ o’clock.
The coroner, empaneled a 'jury and brought the
twelve citizens‘ over with him to Sea Gul1’s Nest to
view the corpse and pass upon the evidence. Roy ’ F.
was called on to tell his story again, while Mr. ‘ 
Jessup and his guests added their testimon . -
The coroner announced that the police had takeng,

 

mysterious ten. 

All the hotels had‘ been visited, but while dozens
ofguests answered the description given by I:.n
nearly all of them were represented by the hotel ‘_ _
people as eminently respectable and above sus-- ’
picion. At no other hotel had ten gentlemen ar-
rived in 9. bunch and registered together, The cor-i
oner’s jury returned a verdict that tlie.decea.sec'l
had come to his death by violence at the hands of
some person or persons unknown, which is the
usual verdict rendered by-coroners’ juries when the‘_
identity _of the ilty party is involved in obscur-
ity. On the fol owing morning Roy took the early.
train for New York. ‘:5

Roy went straight to the office from the dept’)?-
and told the cashier, who was in temporary charge‘, ,.
that Mr. Jessup wouldn’t be in the city that «lay.» .
Then he took his accustomed seat in the reception— I
room and waited to,be called upon to go out, on
render some other service within the range of his
duties.’ As Rov didn’t believe in twiddling his '
thumbs to no purpose, he picked up one of the V
Wall Street dailies and employed his time in keep~ » ~
ing in touch with matters interesting to the '
Street. This, and keeping a close tab onytlie , R a‘
ket, was something Roy never failed to ,do:d _
his leisure moments at the oflice. As it’ X ' his

 
  
  
 
 

   
       

  
 

ambitionto become a broker some day, he   ._x 
that he couldn’t learn too much about wh T=»‘,V_ﬁ§§-"5. ‘:

Roy, ‘on the morning in question, had justiiii-‘

well-deﬁned rumor was in circulation concerni v‘
the probable consolidation of the R. & A. road Wi i .

to his desk and gave him a note to deliver to Mr.
Rankin. of Rankin & Morse, stock brokers,:in the
Mills Building. In front of the Iﬁorgan Bank he’

“Hello. ROY!-” said Fred. “You seem to have i
had a great time during your day and a hal'f’s
stay in Newport.” 

“Yes, I enyoyed myself pretty well; but who:
told you I had a‘ great time?” asked Roy.

“The morning newspaper.” - . v I ’.

“Oh, you’ve read’ the story of the death of
Broker Deacon?” A ~ ‘ . ,

“I read it on my way downtown in the car.
Your-name was printed as large as life, as they

‘bay shore.” ,_ K _, . _  " V W  .

truth, for I was the first to discover the dead body
A of Mr. .Dea,con,”"s.aid Roy.
_ Thus speaking, Roy continued on‘down Broad
‘. ’Street to the Mills Building, where‘ he took an
‘ - elevator for the ﬁfth ﬂoor. Reaching the oﬂice
of Rankin &. Morse, he. walked in and inquired
for Mr. Rankin. ' .
“He's engaged at present,” said the office boy.
“Take a seat.” *
“Take this note to him.
‘Roy. ‘ .u__
The boy took the note, knocked at the door of
_ the private oﬂice, and was told to come in. Roy
.sat down to await his return. He took out of his
pocket a printed market report of‘ Saturday
‘ morning’s transactions on the Stock Exchange and
V began to study it. After a moment ortwo he got
V o12t_hi‘s pencil and felt in his pocketifor apiece of
, (paper. on which to make some ﬁgures.
 V -Not“'fi'nding any, and observing an envelope at
p  ~ his feet,‘ apparently thrown away, he picked it up
.  and began figuring on it.
the office boy came out and handed him a note

Ashe spoke he crumbled the envelope to throw

over the few words written on it. i
It ran as. follows:

‘ front veranda together for nearly an hour after
.—  their introduction, -and then Roy asked her if she

' . would like to take a stroll on the beach.

It was a ﬁne, sunshiny afternoon, not too ‘warm,
with a light sea breeze playing across the surface
of the bay, causing a myriad of tiny wavelets to
dance and sparkle in thelsunlight. Miss Abbott
accepted the invitation, got‘ her pic uresque straw
hat, that looked most becomin perched upon her
wavy, nut-brown locks, and accompanied Roy to
the shore. ‘ ‘ 

X “I suppose you heard about Broker Dea-con’s

death down here, last Saturday night, Miss Ab-
‘_ bott?”., ‘said the ,young'incsscnger as they drew
near the spot where Rov had discovered the body.

I “Yes, it was veryvsad,” replied the girl.

_ “.And.very -mysterious, too,” said Roy. '

i * “So‘I was told. He was killed on the shore here
and then robbed of everything he had about him
atthe time.’,’ i e -

, “Whether he was deliberately murdered, or met
his death accidentally, is not quite clear to me.

He had a nasty wound on his, head, which the

. coroner, who is a physician, said undoubtedly
caused his death. He stated, however, that he

‘could not say positively whether it he been made

by a blunt‘ instrument or from con act with a

jagged rock. It is quiet possible that the person
 or- persons presumed to be responsible for his
death may merely have intended to overcome and

' rob him. In the struggle that would naturally
 have taken place in that case between Mr. Dea-
- con and his assailants he may have slipped, or
have been thrown down. , Suppose his head struck
a.’ rock with considerable force, the wound in
question could easily have resulted." . ' _

“I,believ’e you -were coming along the shore

about the time the affair happened?”

“I was.”  .- .

“You heard him cry out?" ‘ _ «

— .-, “I did,” and took it for the scream of a gull."._
./ “And so n afterward vou found the corpse?” ~

“Yes: I 1 show you the spot. It is low tide

. now, and we can easily go to the exact place.”

 ’ Ina‘ few minutes they were standing at the
I ‘point of the projecing line of rocks where Roy had
"i stumbled over the broker’s body. I -
.4 “He was lying there, withhis head on one of

those‘ rocks,” said Roy. ‘-‘The tide was no to

here, and rolling in all the time; covering him to
the waist _and then receding below his knees. In
order to save, the body from being carried away

’ out into the bay, I dragged it up the beach, and
; then hurried oif to carry the news to Mr. J essup.”

, . :“Were you not frightened when you saw the

- corpse first in the darkness?” asked the girl. ~

“I was a bit startled, ,I admit, for I was not

 I "‘You must be a nervy’ boy,” said Miss Abbott
" . admiringly;  » : _

‘ughed. Roy. “It is something that is needed in
Wall‘ Street, where I work, and I believe in culti-

“That’s right,” nodded Roy. “Do you‘ kno

it Thereupon, Roy told Mr. J essup about the three

mute. *He can hear all right, though.”

    

I 

eagerly accepted the opportunity to follow up i
their acquaintance. / One of the first things Roy V’ ’
did when he got back to the city was to locate ,
the office of Gannon Brothers, stock brokers, on’ ’
his ﬂoor. ’ ~
“I dare say I’ve seen the Gannon brothers ,a
hundred times, and never took any more notice -of
them than of any other broker, until last Tues-
day, when by accident I met their duplicates,
twice repeated, inside of a few minutes. That 7
circumstance, and the fact that the six, together .
with their companions, made upten men who 
looked so much alike in size and dress, called
to my mind the ten men I had so recently met at
Newport under such singular conditions. If I
had not met the mysterious ten on the rocks that
night, in all probability I would not have noticed
the Wall Street ten. Now my curiosity is
aroused, and ‘I am goingto try and find out as
much as I can about the Gannon brothers, their
duplicates, and the other four who make up the 
ten‘ in question,”, said Roy, ashe turned hisback \ ‘
on the door of the Gannon Brothers and started .
for his own oﬂice. , ‘ ;.-3»
- At that moment the door of the office opposite,;..'
labeled Richard Cordley, stocks and bonds, opened,’
and the gentlman with the mustache he had seen
in company with the Gannon brothers at the Ex-
chan e came out into the corridor and started for
the e evator. Roy gazed after him. it 
“That is one of the Wall Street ten now.’ "I
wish I knew‘ who he is,” thought the young mes‘~
senger. “Though it-seems to me his face has a. ,
familiar look.” ‘
One ‘of the elevators came up at that moment -
and a gentleman got out. ' -
“Hello, Cordiey,” he said to the man, and the;
other shook hands ‘with him. , ,_  ‘
“So this is Richard Cordley,” muttered Roy as» is
he walked away. “Seems to me»I carried anote ‘ —,
to him a few months ago, and then he wore a '
full beard. Well, I s’pose he's’ got a right to -
shave the hair off his face if it,feels too warm '
in the summer time, or any other time, for that
matter. ’ ‘ V

Roy entered Jessi'ip’s office ._ and took his seat, ‘

‘ picking up a Wall Street daily to occupy his at-H 

tention. While he was waiting for his services to :-.«
be called into use again the door of the receptionﬁ. ,._ ;
room opened and a gentleman entered. He had a 
derbyhat, wore a mustache and a double-breasted
sackcoat. ’ . V v  —.
“I wonder if this is one of the Gannon broth- 
ers.?” muttered Roy as he advanced to meet him. ‘ 
The visitor-took a pad out of his pocket \and a
wrote _on it, “Is Mr. Jessup in?” and showed
the writing to Roy. _ . , 
“Yes, he's in,” replied the younger messenger,

  
 
   

surprised at the‘ caller’s action.

“ , ake my name7—-Oliver Gannon—in to ‘him,’—’‘/ ; I

er." thought Roy as he returned and ushered the
visitor into the room. ,~

As he did so his sharp eyes observed one thing—
‘ ., that Oliver Gannon wore a pair of cuff-buttons

‘just like the one he had picked up on the shore at
Newport on Saturday afternoon. That discovery
furnished him with food for thought. Apparently
this style of cuﬁ-button was much in vogue, for
Mr. Green had "said that Deacon wore a pair,
Oliver Gannon was sporting a pair, and a man
whose initials were R. and C. had a pair until
he‘lost one of them—the one Roy found.

»“I wouldn’t be surprised if Oliver Gannon’s
brother had a pair, too,” Roy said to himsel:f. “It
would be quite‘ natural if he had. I suppose the
Gannon brothers are twins, for they’ look pretty
. near alike. I should like to run across the man
' who lost the cuff-but/ton. I'll bet it is one of

those /ten men down here who resemble each other
so much. If I could identify him as one of_ them,

, V then I’d be pretty certain they are really the

0 mysterious ten of Newport.” ‘

Mr. Oliver Gannon only remained with Mr. Jes-

, sup 2 short time and then he took his departure.
About the same time Roy was sent to a broker
on Exchange ‘Place with a. message. The broker
was. very busy and could not be disturbed, so the
boy had to wait. He took a seat and picked up a
paper to ass thetime. -The door opened, and in
.walked a roker, with a mustache. Roy had never
paid any attention to mustaches until he found

,them associated with the Gannon brothers; now

they possessed an unusual interest for him. This
man had a derby, and he wore a double—bi;easted
sack coat.
“I’ll bet this is one of the friends of the Gannon
brothers,” thought Boy right away. .
“The newcomer asked for the broker.
“He's engaged,” said the oﬂice boy. “If you’ll
i’ give me your name I’ll.take. it in as soon as he's
at liberty.” " _
, “My name is Grismer,” replied the caller, walk-
ing over to one of the windows near where Roy
, s t. ' .

~ all-_Ie raised his right hand and began to stroke

—'*"ghis well-trained mustache, while he looked care-

‘ lessly out into the court that furnished light

and air to the offices in the center of the tall

building. Then it was that Roy no iced that he

‘had a pair of 'the_same black-ename ed, diamond-
encrusted cuff-buttons, too. ‘ ‘

“This cuff-button business is growing interest-

He listened intently, and learned enough to
assure him that there wasn‘t any doubtabout the

back to his oﬂice he looked up D. & 0., and found
that it was going at 82. On his way home he.
stepped into the little bank on Nassau Street and
left an order with the margin clerk to buy..1,0'G0’
shares of D. & O. for his account, puttingliip
$10,000 as ‘security. He visited. the bank thi

for the expected’ boom. $uddenly a number;
rumors began to circulate through the dist
about the D. ,& O. road, all or which were to tla“

 CHAPTER VII.—'I.‘he Gannon Sextette Once

' ~"/The market quickly recovered from the brief
panic brought about by the sudden fall in the
‘ inﬂated price of D. & 0., and continued quite

buoyantfor two weeks, during which time busi-
’ ness was lively in the Street, and as a consequence
all employees, from cashier to messenger boy, in
the various offices were kept on the hustle. One
day Mr. Jessup senthim with a note’ to Mr.
Cordley’s office. Althoughzthe broker was _en—
gaged with a visitor at the time, he was permited

day Roy learned who he was. He _soon found out
‘that it was Grismer, for Cordley said to him: .
» '“I~Iere, Mitchell! Look over that paper while I

“Well, the fact that I. who know nearly every-

seen or heard of more than two Gannon brothers, = .<.,
and have never heard about, four men resembling - *3‘
them, ought to be some evidence that the four like-
nesses. of the Gannons you say you saw are pretty ’
rare visitors to the district. Under such circum-
stances I doii’t see why you worry about them.” . V
Mr. Jessup got up, closed his desk, put on his ’ W‘
hat, and vfent home. There was so much business .

they were I

to atteriﬂ to in the office that day that the ‘cashier

and the clerks had to work overtime; The cashier’
asked Roy if he would‘ stay down, too, and help ~
out at some desk work." ’ " . ' — ,«
“Sure I will,’-’ replied the boy. “How late-do » i
you want me to stay?” » - Q
“Nine or ten o’clock.”
“Then I’d like to send a message to my mother,
so, she’ll know where I am.”
“Go out and send your message now,” said the
cashier. \ ' ._
Roy_went to the nearest telegraph ofﬁce and‘.  f.
sent his message. On his way‘ back he met the 

:‘I'.W0 Gannon brothers at the corner of Nassau

Street, on their way to Broadway. The fact
barely. attracted his notice. _ When he reached the
entrance to the oﬂice building he was staggered,
however, 1.1) come face to face with 3. pair of their
duplicates. They didn’t go toward Broadway, but
turned down Wall Street toward Pearl.

“Gee !» I wish Mr. Jessup was with in now,”
muttered Roy. _ “He'd have seen four annons
_for once in his life. and he couldn't get away from. _
it. It s awonder the elevator men didn't notice
the two pair of twins. Still, it is‘ not unlikely .
that the gentlemen came down on different ele-, V
vators. _ The_Se’S1X Gannons, I’m.afi-aid, will turn
in -bra_in.before I’m through with them.” ‘

oy boarded an elevator and was whisked up V 
to the fourth ﬂoor, where he got out. As he passed 
the oiﬁce of the Gannon-brothers the door opened, I z,
and out came the third pair of Gannons. 

Suffering dervishes!” gasped the youn ‘mes- . "
senger. “Here's the third batch. If this doesn’t '
I’ll bet there is some

 

gated. I wonder if they all wear black-enameled,” .3
ianrlond-encrusted cuﬂ’-buttons? ‘I should not be 
a bit surprised if I found they did.” ' ' ' 

~The‘.last pair of -Gannon brothers took an ele- I 
vator and disappeared. Roy‘~walked thoughtfully ..
into his office.’ He felt that he was confronted ' 'i

 

 

whole lot until he succeeded in solvingit, if; in- - 
deed,_he could solve it. Two of the six men he ‘:3.
bad Just encountered who looked so much alike‘ _

that he had to admit that he couldn’t- tell them
apart, were the Gannon brothers, known. to Wall
Street. Who were the other four? Were they ‘
Gannon brothers, too, who only came to the Street ,
occasionally? Were there three pair of twins in ’
that family nearly of one age? The thing was

. “I told you that it was a good tip,” she said ’

smilingly. , 
} ‘7I guess there isn’t -any doubt about it, but _I
don’t believe the syndicate will be able to push it

_ up to par.”

“Why not?” . _
_ “Because 30 points is a mighty big Jump for
‘such a stock as J. 8:, C.” _
" “Of course, I can’t say, but, I should think papa
mlght to know.”. _ .
7"=.“‘If the syndicate eifects a close corner it may
be able to force it even higher than par; but the
higher it is boomed the more dangerous it Wlll be
-to unload and hold the price at the same time.”
.“Then you mean to sell out before it goes to
ar?”

. ‘.‘_ ,“That is my present intention, but circum-

stances may change it.”

 They talked over the deal’ a while longer, then‘

Nellie went to the piano and they had music and
., iiging until it was time for him to go home.
Next day J. & C. slowly advanced another point.
Even. one point looked mighty good to Rov. for it
}.‘t‘: resented a proﬁt in sight of $3,000. On -the
followin day it began to attract general atten-
'tion’,,an quite a little business was done in it, the
"rice going up to 78, Roy saw the early quota-
ops on the ticker tape, and he judged that there

, ould be something doing soon in J . & C. He was
disappointed, for as noon approached more
and more of the traders began buying, and as the
‘price advanced to 80 so the interest and excite-
ment that always attend a rising ‘stock increased.
v.All' the stocks along the line began to partici-

. ate in the improved prices, and everybody was
iying and few selling. Roy was sent to the Ex-.
‘change several’ times that morning, and on each
‘ cafsion he found the racket greater than before,
and more traders on the floor. Mostof the mes-
sengers had to skip their lunches that day, Roy
being among the number, for business ke t the_m
offthe jump right up to nearly three o’c ck.._. J.
’&_,C.' closed at 88, with every prospect of opening
higherwhen the Exchange,

While he was in the counting-room,’

, orning
 returning from the bank, -where he had
‘taken the day’s deposits, he heard two of ’ the

ested in a'few shares, and were looking to see
' 'price..g0 to par. Roy asked them how they
n,ew7‘that J.,& C. was going to par. - I

ecause the shares are cornered! by a‘ syiidi-  '

,f’ replied, one. I

Maybe it will, and maybe it won’t,be able to. I I

the young messenger had even ﬁve shares (‘if that

oy went on to the washrooln, and soon after-
ward left for home. The fact that he was al-
ready something over $50,000 to the good, withan

excellent prospect of making half again as much »

more, kept Roy in a subdued state of excitement

all evening. , He dreamed that night that hehad '

become a millionaire, and was living like a prince

in-a palace of a hohse, with his mother and sister,  '
who had become society leaders, while he was ‘

taking Nellie Abobtt automobiling every._after-
noon. Every place he went, or found himself, he
met the Gannon brothers in a group of two, all
exactly alike, and it seemed to strike him as all
right. When he awoke in the morning; he recol-
lected all the features of his dream, and he
laughed at theabsurd fancies his sleeping brain
had conceived.

“As if three pairs of Gannon brothers, aren’t

opened at 98 next morning, went up to 99, and
then began to drop slowly back.- In the course

of an hour there was a rush of selling orders, '

which increased the excitement, but did not de-
velop into anything like a panic. Roy was sent

with a message to a broker in the Pluto Building 

on Broad Street. The trader having stepped
into a neighboring oﬁice, the boy had to wait till
he came back. He took a seat near a couple of
gentlemen, who "proved to be brokers. These
gentlemen were talking about the intimate busi-

ness relations that had existed between Richard I  " 

Cordley and William Deacon, the broker who had
lost his life at Newport. ’

“The Newport police never discovered the per- ’  
son or persons responsible for the death of Dea- r 0

“Inever heard that they» did,” replied the other. ,  3

“There was something in the papers at the

“What was it?” ’ I
“You know the Gannon brothers, don't you?”
“I’m not acquainted with them personally, but
Iknow them by sight. They’re twins, and both

mutes. Have to talk with a pad of those unac-
uainted with the sign language. What about
‘t]hem?” A

“Yesterday afternoon, about half-past three, I
met them coming out of the Standard Building,
where they have their oﬂices, on the fourth ﬂoor.
I conversed with them in the dumb alphabet, but
they were in a hurry to go uptown, and we only
talked about a minute. Then I took an elevator

' up to the fourth ﬂoor to see Cordley. As I step-

ped out who do you suppose I saw in front of

“How should I know?"

“The same Gannon brothers I had left on the
street only three minutes before!”' .

' “Get out!” exclaimed his companion. “How
could you?”

“But I did. I was completelystaggered. Be-
fore I recovered myself they took an elevator
and went down.”

“I never heard that there were
Gannon twins,” . _

“There isn’t. I called Cordley's attention to

. the circumstance as soon as I entered his office.
2 and he laughed at me. He insisted that I was
mistaken in thinking the second pair were actu-
ally duplicates of the Gannon brothers. _He said

he knew the Gannons as well as he knew any

,one, in fact better, if anything, and he knew

there were only two of them.”

“I-Ie ought to know, then.” ,

, “I don’t care what he knows. Those two men

. ,I met on\the fourth ﬂoor werethe dead images
of the Gannon brothers. I guess I’ve as good a
pair of eyes as anybody in Wall Street."

At that moment the office boy came up_ and
told‘ Roy to carry his message into the private
‘room, so he didn’t hear any more: of a conversa-
tion that was. intensely interesting to him.,«

» . “Know that gentleman yonderf.7””he asked the

" boy, indicating the man who had. seen two pairs

of the Gannon brothers.» , .

“Yes; that’s Broker Dayton. ’~

“Where’s his oﬂicen?” ,

“Mills Building.’_’ ‘ 

‘Roy delivered his message and then returned
to his own office, where he made a note in his
memorandum-book that Broker Dayton had seen

two pairs of

two pairs of the Gannon brothers and was greatly I

puzzled by the fact.» Four or ﬁve weeks passed

I .oods. Sometimes he wondered why Mr. Cor -
' vley had not called on him for the cuff-but n he
. had lost, the intrinsic value of which, h had
gathered from Tiffany's manager, was about $150.
I He was satisﬁed that Cordley did not care to
v - admit that the button was his, and that fact
added to the boy's suspicions -thatthere was
something behind it. By close observation he had

 

 

Gannon brothers. V

ley. One afternoon, as he was leaving the oﬁice,
about four o’clock, he saw one of the men, whom
he thought was Grismer, enter the office of ‘tiiem; _,
Gannon brothers. While he was waiting for the " '
elevator to take him down, a cage came up and
let out another of the men, whom Roy took. for .

The man went directly to the same ofﬁce. When V
Roy reached the corridor below he ran against the 
third, whom he judged to 'be Bailey, vjust stelming ,
into an elevator. , . ' »‘ '
“There must be a meeting up in Gannon Broth-‘ ,

outer entrance. “I'd give a whole lot to know"
what is going on in there.”  f’
He walked as far as-the sub-treasury

“I’m going back to see if I can ﬁnd

So he went back and took an elevator for

around a few minutes, and then, approaching

' " ’ And a Heart as Well. ,

     
 
   

l About this time there was a lot of talk in Wall

mg, the largest trunk lines in the country, and
though his methods did not meet with the ap-
proval, he managed to get ahead Just the same.
 .The E. & G. was an important road in its

 good times it sold at 105 and upward. After
' uring the matter up, Roy decided to buy 20,000
’ shares of this stock, just to see how things would
’ n out. He didn’t see how he could lose anything

.the deal. _ _ _

In fact, all the chances were in his favor of his
snaking anywherefrom ﬁve to ten dollars a share
if he held on long enough“ Hardly had he bought
rthe stock when it jumped up to 97 in one hour.
This caused a‘ great deal of excitement in the
Eichange, and in the rush to purchase that fol-
lowed it went up to 1004 From a conversation that
Royoverheard between Mr. J essup and a big oper-
31-,or',-the boy decided to sell, and not chance it go-
ing-'higher. He gave the order to his broker, Mr.
Webster, to do so, and the stock was sold at "100
and ,a fraction, Roy realizing a proﬁt of $160,000.
,That‘put the young messenger’s resources very
. close to the half-million mark. Next day E. & G.

money has taken my breath away.. The whole

thing has been just like _a dream! To think of me, « V‘

a messenger, dealing in 20,000 and 30,000 lotsof
railroad stock at a time! I can’t realize it. When
I sold the last lot its market value amounted to
$3,300,000, and I held it on a deposit of $300,000.
Gee! I guess I’d better give up the messenger
business. When a fellow is worth as much as I
am, there is no callfor him to be at the beck and
call of other people. _I’ve been so long with Mr. ‘
Jessup, and he treats me so ﬁne, that I hate to
break away from him. I believe I’d rather work
for him than be my own boss. Well, I must con-
sider carefully what is,best for me to do.’.’

The report that the railroad magnate had got
control of E. & G. proved to be premature, and
the price of the stock dropped quick as a wink,
causin quite a panicin the market. A number
of bro ers were forced to suspend, while many

others were hard hit. The Street declared that '

somebody had put up a job, and got away with
it, and there was howling and gnashing of teeth
on all sides. No one could tell how many out-
siders had been caught, but it was generally
believed that the number was not small. In fact,
it was noticed that there was a sudden dearth
of lambs in the district. Among the brokers who
had been badly nipped was Mr. Jessup. '
He and many of his friends had one into
E. & G., and had held on too long. hey had
been tipped oﬁ‘ to the fact that E. & G. would go
to 115, but as we have seen, it only went to a
little over 110, which indicated that astute per-
sons had managcd to get a,fake pointer to Jessup

and his friends, and they had been caught where ,

the hair was short.

When .settlements were in order, Jessup found
that Richard Cordley and the Gannon brothers had
him cornered to éiqonsiderable extent. He found

V that he would hailbﬁdao sell his best securities out-

Tlght and m°1”t€3_EZ¢." his ho/ine*;,4,1,:o-keep his head

business as if nothing had happened to cripple,

‘him. It was aﬁhard thing for him to dispose of

his gilt-edged securities at that time, for the prices
of stocks were lower than for several years. It
would mean a great loss to him, for he had paid «

much more for them than«he could sell them for ’. I.

now. The fact got out-that J essup, among others .
had been badly done ,  the E. & G. slump, and

are telling me.” . _ _. j '
Accordingly, Roy began at the beginning and.
told the broker how for a long time heehad been.
a customer of the little bank and brokerage house’
on Nassau Street, beginning with a purchase of
five shares of a certain stock, on which he put
up $50——money which he had saved for the pur-
pose.‘ a « ~ z
He had more than doubled his money on». his? »
ﬁrst deal, and he kept right on, with varying‘.
success, until he had accumulated $3,000.- _ ' ‘
“Then I bought, 600 shares of R. & A.,“and,
made over $9,000 out’ of it,” went on Roy. '-“After, "_
that I bought 1,000 D. & 0., and cleared $21,000.
With $34,000 capital’, I purchased 3,000”J.. & _C.,
and my profit on that deal amounted to $7»8',00(l,
which made me worth over $100,000. ‘That
brings me up to the recent E. & G. ﬂurry. "I
first bought 20,000 at 92, and when it reached pair’
I sold out, clearing $160,000. When it went dew,
to 94 I bought 30,000 shares of it, and -afimf
holding it a few days I sold at the climaxof the
excitement, making $480,000 clear proﬁt,‘ ‘I have
now in a safe—deposit box in the Washington”
vaults, a few doors below here, $950,000 in‘ cash;
That's, the whole story." .  ~. _» ‘
Mr. J essup looked at Roy a few morrients Wit
out uttering a word. He was dumbfounded at"the;
boy’s revelation. ‘ . ._’. ’
“If you are the possessor of $950,000, young
man, you are much better oﬁ’ than I am at this"
moment,” returned the broker. ; . ‘ ?
“Well, sir, you‘ will pardon me for stati" .

minutes later ‘the cashier received 9. telephone-V
message from his house saying that the brolcer ‘
had been taken suddenly ill and would not be
down that day. The news circulated through the.
office and Roy heard about it. He was greatly
disappointed, for he wanted his employer to set’
the ball rolling for their mutual interests. He 
knew that no time ought to be lost in securing,
as much of the A. & L. stock ahead of the syn- I ‘
dicate as possible. While he was considering the I,
.matter the cashier sent him out with a note to,‘ -. »
a ‘broker in Exchange Place. After delivering’ ‘ 
the note, to which there was noanswer, he ‘sto —' " I

which had put through his recent big deals. ’ g 3‘
When Roy entered Mr. Webster's private room " ,
that morning he was greeted quite eﬁusively byw:
the broker, who scented another ‘order, with a
large commission attached to it. I V , ,
-“What can I do for you this morning?" i =’ ,
“I want you to go out and buy me any part of I
30,000 shares of A. & L. "as .close~to the market

“All right,” replied Webster, rubbing his hands _'
with -satisfaction. at the size of_ the order. “I g I ,
will attend to the matter right away.” " 
“Here is $300,000 deposit to’ cover the whole ’- '
order. Should ,.you, be unable to ﬁll the bill en»

when I call to’-morrow.” * . ‘ a f"~
Mr. Webster nodded, and Roy hastened backto ' .
his own oﬁice, arriving just in time to, take out  :
another message for the cashier. .  l ’
On his way back from the bank,.where' he had‘
taken the‘day’s deposit, about a quarter to three, ‘
Roy dropped in’ at Webster & Co.’s to ﬁnd out

“Buy the entire block!” cried_ Roy eagerly.
, Mr. ‘Webster didn’t lose any time in hustling
around to, Goodkind & Hi~rsch’s office and secur-
ing the stock, which Goodkind had given him an‘
nour’s option on. Roy returned to Webster's of-
rice about as soon as the broker did himself, and
handed him the additional‘ security. Webster
then excused himself, as he had to make arrange-

‘ ments with his bank to help him carry such a big

amount of stock as 60,000 shares worth $72 a
share, or the total sum of $4,320,000. r

“Gee! I wonder what Mr. J essup will say when
I tell him about this big deal I’ve gone into?”_
thought Roy when he got out on the street. “He’1l

._ I have now got control of over four million dol-

lars’ worth of stock! I reckon I’m in a osition

Watkins’ stock would not come into the market.
I wonder what caused her to order it sold now,
after saying that she never intended to sell it?
Why, I almost had a ﬁt when Mr. Webster said
that it was her stock that Goodkind & Hirsh had
for sale.” '

Roy felt tickled to death over the prospect that
he saw ahead. He was sure that the syndicate
would’ go right ahead, unsuspicious of the trap
that lay in its path, and that with the tremendous

— . amount of shares he had at his disposal he would
' be able to beat the Wall ‘Street ten to a. stand-.

still, for after they had boomed,-the stock up the
'ey would never
be able tohold the market in face of Roy’s 60,000

? CHAPTER XV.—Roy surprises Mr. Jessup
« , Again. ‘ . . 1
The new messenger was down at the oﬂi
promptly at a quarter to nine, the time Roy
told him to report and Roy himself came in a few.
minutes later. He devoted his time, till the
cashier came in, to coaching the new boy inhis
duties; then he introduced him to the cashier, tell
ing that gentleman that owing to certain. -(fond
tions th_at.had turned up he (Roy) could’.‘§no.
longer give his time to carrying messages about
the Street. . ’ ‘ r
The cashier was a bit surprised, but as he 
that it was only a question of a few days" who
Roy was to quit as a messenger, anyhow, he prem-'
sumed that the prospective junior partner was
acting in accordance with instructions from.Mr‘
Jessup. , ‘ -, :4
Roy then told him that the broker was quite ill,
and would not be down for a week in all pro
ability. As soon as ten o’clock came Roy nia,'dejs.'
bee line for the Stock Exchange gal1ery,'and
stayed there till he felt hungry, when he wentfto

lunch. .

After lunch he went back, and remained the ,
till the Exchange closed for the day. He enjoys
watching -the brokers buying and selling on .th§ "
floor, but kept his eyes particularly on the ‘lofojk’-». 5
out for Richard Cordley. , 
That broker did not appear on the ﬂoor ata
that day, though Roy saw two of‘ the Gannon se
tette walking about with their tabletsin the:
hands doing business. and he took it for grante
that they were the real Gannon brothers..  ,
The next day was Friday, and Roy haunted the
Exchange the same as he had done the ‘day be-
fore. .Cordley did not turn up, and Ro judged
that he was arounditown, visiting the bro ersy '
bu ing up A. & L. shares on the quiet.  V _~
' oy was present next day at the two-hour],
sion of _the Exchange, from ten to twelve,,b
there was still nosign of Cordley. As soon
business ceased» Roy walked leisurely out _‘to
restaurant and ate hislunch; then he returned
the building where hisoﬂlce was. He knew‘?
the syndicate of ten wasgoing ‘to hold anotli
meeting at two o’clock, arid he intended to see‘
he could find out some moreIpoints»through Lt
convenient keyhole. . ‘ E ,-
‘ As there was scarcely anybody in the bur
except the janitor and his assistants at tha'.t'h ‘
on Saturday, Roy ex ected to have the_vco1f1ii’db'
pretty much to himse'f.A  ..-
He reached the floor about ten minutes at
two, and walked softly up to the ‘door of the G
non Brothers’ private office. The syndicate-«-of'
was already seated about the tab e in the_x"'d
and Richard Cordley was making is reP<.Jr,t
said that on Monday he would make the ﬁnal
chases in the open market. There were still
30,000 shares-in the possession of outsider V
bulk of which he considered it necessary that
should secure at any ﬁgure below 80. 'I‘,l1Je,,
plans were considered, and Roy found on
the syndicate intended to unloadijust ass

u may happen.” 7 * »
 At eleven next day A. & L. touched 101, and
‘then Webster and his partner, who were on the
~_ .‘~_door, waiting to trade, came to the front and be-
< ,” fzan alternately tendering the stock to Cordley, at
 ‘ first in 2,000 lots. ’1‘he leader of the syndicate
’ I _ took it as fast as it was offered, though he'didn’t
y.like to do _it for a cent. \ When Webster offered
him the first 5,000 lot Cordley seemed staggered,
 for‘ he had ﬁgured that/the syndicate now held all
 the outstanding shares. He had to take it in at
I anyscosty for it was absolutely necessary for the
syndicate to hold the market. ’ I 
After a short interval Webster’s partner shoved‘
’ another 5,000 at him. Cordle turned livid, but‘
2‘ ‘took it in sheer desperation. T en Webster turned
‘V _':1p with another 5,000. That capped the climax.
Cozydley had already beeniforced to accept 30,000
: shares at 101,'representing an outlay of over three
‘ million, and he knew thesyndicate did not have
”, ‘the’ money to pay for it- He couldn’t understand
where the stock was coming from. Their plans
were already knocked into a cocked hat, for the

 

0 ‘first time in‘ the clique’s history, and ruin stared ,

ix,‘ them in the face. 0 .
‘ K .3 “I can’t take it!’.’ he said soarsely.
'‘‘Then I’ll have to throw it on -the market,” re-
. I plied Webster. ~ I ‘
Vi“. ”’ ~' -_“_It will break the price!” gasped Cordley.
l “I ean’t help that. I am following orders."
. “Have you any more besides (that batch?” asked
:. Cordley. . .
‘ ‘ “Yes.” 0 0 .  l
. y “In the name of thunder whose stock.is it that
ayou are offering?” _ ‘ . ‘
“Mrs. Horace Watkins’.” . w“
“My heavens! Thatsettles itl” gasped Cord-
ley. “We are ruined!” ' . V _, l
0 He rushed from the Exchange like a madman
,. tofcommunicate the terrible news to’ his assow
 ciayes, who were awaiting» results in the office of
 Gannon Brothers. Bv thetime he faced them,
"the picture of despair, the. market was on the
run,‘ and‘ the most intense excitement ranyriot in
, , the Exchange. , It could scarcely be called a panic,
/‘however, as few persons were reallypinvolved in
the slump of A.’ & L. The syndicate had most of
' the stock, and had been, caught before‘ the mem-
’ hers were able to unload any on the brokers or
the publicpconsequentlyrthe clique of ten were
~ nractica-lly the-only sufferers, andthey all went to
~ itheywall with a crash. - A y
 « When the Exchange closed A. &'L. was down to
'30. ,Next morning; it opened at 79,, and sank to
~70 in an hour. Roy still held 20,900 shares, on-
which he was out about $60,000; but to‘ offset'this
: heshad three—quarters of a million proﬁt coming
to him. Whether he would get it all depended on V’
[theability of the,syndicate of ten tojmeet its en-
agements up to the moment of the, slump. Roy
ad alreadyvcarried the news of his success to Mr.

STEAM-DRIVEN AEROPLANE

/ From Germany has come the report of the V
development of a steam—driven aeroplane which is
said to be remarkably efﬁcient inall of the points‘.
in which the gasoline-driven plane is lacking. The :
power and speed. of the steam-driven automobile '
are fairly well-known and recognized. The steam- '
powered airplane is built entirely of metal and
steam is generated by a combination of crude

and other oils which isbroken up under a forced
"air feed and sprayed against the boiler.

Here

it ignites giving a terriﬁc «heat. It is said that '
ten gallons of oil are sufficient to run the plane's if 
7 50—horsepower engine for eight hours. The water gl 
tanks are located in the metal wings of the ‘huge a
plane and the steam. is condensed aftter use and , “
returned to these tanks. , .

American aeronautical engineers have expei-i— 
mented with steam planes, but have encountered V ~~
diﬁiculty in condensing the steam and ‘_returning ;-.
It '60 the Water tan.ks_without the use of heavy ’ 7‘
apparatus. They are inclined to doubt the state-,
ment regarding the small amount of fuel oil need-
ed_to operate the German plane; Eight hours‘ . ;
ﬂying from ten gallons of oil seems almost-too‘  1
00d to be true. . There is little doubt that the"

 

eventually replace the gasoline-driven one a"
commercial vehicle. . D /‘V  '  =

‘ THEFT OF HOUSE _
- A complaint ﬁled with the Paris police by Mme.
I Cabert said that her whole house had been stolen.
Mme. Cabert stated that she had built a small
house of wood in the Rue de la Saltpetriere. She

was called away to visit a dying aunt and when-.

she returned the house had disappeared.

SPLINTERLESS GLASS _

Closely resembling ordinary glass andsuitable
to take its place for many purposes, a chemical
substitute that is said not to splinter has been
produced in Germany. Because of this quality,
it is being recommended for panes of motor cars
and in optical instruments.

ANCIENT FASHIONS

Pearls from the Ohio mound hoards show that
, ' the ancient Indians who built them and accumu-
lated the jewels found in them were as fastidious
. as modern jewelersabout their quality, according
‘ to Dr. Walter Hough of the United States Na-
V tlonal Museum. They used only perfectly shaped
sfiearls, rejecting even the baroque that receive at

‘ east minor favor from Europeans.

. » _ FROZEN EGGS .

Eggs kept in cold storage in a frozen condition

' _ for nearly nine years have been found by the Bu-

reau of Chemistry of the United States.Depart-

’ 'ment of Agriculture to retain’ practically their

original vitaminx_A potency. From the results of

~ this experimental work it seems that freezing

‘ eggs and keeping them for long periods in cold

storage causes but little if any deterioration with
respect to this vitamin. — —



* FIVE COLOR PENCIL
A pocket pencil that will write in an one of
five colors is a new convenience for the o .ce_man.
!It is of the self-feeding type. When a lead, of a
."‘f. certain color is to be used, an indicator near the
 point is turned until itregisters the desired color.
A; twist on a knurled knot at the end of the holder
thenej ects the lead at the point. *
The pencil has a clip to fasten it to the coat

 One of the most lively and picturesque fea-
tures in a circus performance is “leaping by the
entire company,” particularly in a show where
it is participated in by forty of ﬁfty skilled per-
formers. "

 

Running down a long inclined plane and taking’

a start oil‘ the springboard, ,they, one b one, in
rapid succession, dart high in air and ar away
, to land on the thick mattress, whereone or two
V sturdy fellows stand braced to catch them. ’
Over horses they ﬂy,‘ then over camels and
,elephants,,ﬁnal1y over a pyramid of men upon
the elephants’ backs. , '
~ , It is. marvelous what prodigious leaps they
 make, and so swiftly do they follow each other
 that when they get well going the effect is pre-
v  sented of a fountain activel spouting a ﬂoodiof
twisting, writhing, darting bodies‘ and legs bril-
liant in all the colors of th rainbow.
Two, three orrfour men se in to be in the air
at once, and each turns one or two somersaults
 ;~a;during his ﬂight. l s ‘
* ' ~The spectators applaud and say, “How pretty!”
“How grace,fu1!”_ and “How easy!” .
; , Not one in a hundred says what is most emin-
 ‘ ently true, “How dangerous!” '
,‘ . The factis that all circus men recognize this
 as one of the most dangerous pieces of work they
~ ’ «arecalled upon to perform. * _
' ‘Not’ a season passes in which, in every circus
on the road, men are not seriously injured and

 “ exvenylamed for life by‘ accidents in doing the high '

;‘Som_etimes backs are broken, though that is
 not so frequent as the breaking of legs, and a
, common thin is the breakingor severe sprain-
 :ing of an an le. l ' l y ' ‘
_ ; Andthere is hardly any other physical mis-
chance that the circus;—performer dreads so much
, as an injury to his ankle. It is liable to put an
end forever to all his riding, tumbling, acrobatic
, ‘work, to everything, in fact, by which he gains
-‘ _ liis—_.bread.— ' ” , ,
'1‘ ‘Thegreat danger to the leaper is in his somer-
‘sault. If he is very skillful he may have a pretty
clear idea while he is in the air of where and
.‘ ‘how he 'is' going to land after a double somer-
;.:, ‘sault; but many leapers go through life with-
’ pout‘ solving that problem satisﬁac-torily, and, of
 pfjourse, they are the most frequent sufferers by
 it accidents. 5 ' =‘ _ g

Hiram ranklin, who was one of the .bes
riders and general performers of his day;
did a double somersault from a springboard, i‘
this country sixty years ago, in Niblo’s Garden

Reynolds, in the old Bowery Am‘pithe,ateir,V
1844. Now it is a common accomplishmen '
turn double somersaults, but that is twi’
enough for the prudent men in the business.
A somewhat varied form of the “leaping ac ,
technically .known as the “Spanish Trampoline
which used to be practiced in all, circuses and
never seen now, was especially dangerous. ‘
In that the men sprang from a solid start;
point instead of a springboard, and wentaoa,
liorlses, the number of which was increased gm

"Tim Turner clearedsixteen horses, and Hiram
Franklin seventeen. V   ‘
The extreme difficulty of such a leap ‘will;-bé

Of-course, he risked his neck every time he

plause of about one hundred of those who saw
him, the others seeing nothing particularly re-
Wilarkable in the feat. -
» ‘Another famous rider named Sebastian used
‘ to t,urn’a somersault from the back of his horse
and go through a space barely large enough for
_ his.body to pass between the points of keen bowie
.knives‘ set in a hoop. =

Martin Lowande did the same thing off a bare-

‘One of the most dangerous individual feats
er ‘preformed in a circus ring was the “cata-

In that the performer laid himself straight

 of those springs changed surprisingly in
ympathy with scarcely observable changes in the

When Leonard ﬁrst did the great ﬂying trapeze ’ ‘

act, originated by him, he practiced it without , ' 

any safeguard, but at a moderate elevation, in _.~'
the Toulon gymnasism, and then, at his ﬁrst pro-
duction of it in the Cirque Napoleon, in Paris, _.i
swung his trapezes at such a height that if he’,
had missed his clutch by but a fraction of an ,'
inch he would have fallen ﬁfty-ﬁve feet to the
ground. a  __

Doubtless he would have put them still higher‘
if the roof had not been in his way.

As they Were, the only way he had of getting

ing that name. ~— . , "1

She had a nes of ten tables built to’ ‘‘tel,e—‘ . ‘

Standing up, there, she would let‘ herself drop ,

PARROT’S CURIOSITY SAVES HIS owN
' LIFE

sesessr

 

3 Curiosity may often pr_ove the nemes,is_of the
cat, but in the case of_“B1lly the parrot ’ it went
.1 long way toward_saving his life. .
Billy was surprised _at 4:30 o'clock when his
owner, Theodore Louyinger, ran through the
iiouse carrying bucketsof water. The ‘ parrot

- started shouting persistently, “What’s the mat-

ter? What's the matter?”

His cries attracted the attention of Louyinger,

who dashed through the ﬂames and into the
kitchen, removed the cage from the hook and car-

. sled the parrot safely to the yard, away from.

the ﬁre.

‘ . SODA WATE "
Soda water, sold in drug s ores and other
places, consists of aomixture of carbonic acid and
water, ﬂavored with various kinds of syrups. For
this reason, special contrivances, such as pumps,
cylinders, etc., are required for making and serv-
ing it. A glass of plain soda, to which any_ﬂavor
, may be added, is! compounded by placing in one
tumbler thirty grains of carbonate of soda, and in
..nother twenty-ﬁve grains of tartaric or citric
..cid., An equal uantity of water is poured in
.ach ‘glass, stirre with a spoon, and then mixed

“PRAIRIE” FIRE SWEEPS BUFFALO PEII
IN zoo - ~

Sevenbored buffalo, blase in the face of a civilis
zation that regards them merely as exhibits, and
a little buffalette, had a taste of atavism a: few.
days ago when ‘a “prairie” ﬁre-—-such as. that
which used to send herds of their ancestors bound-
ing across the‘ plains years ago—-swept through
their pen in the Central Park Zoo.’ ~ »— ~,

It was the geese in the model barn-yard, sever ,
pens away, that ﬁrst gave the alarm. When En,-’
gine Company No. 39 arrived piles of hay in the
buffalo enclosure were blazing ﬁercely whilethe
bison, heads lowered angrily toward the ﬂames;
had backed into a far corner. In their midst and;
shielded from the heat was a little buffalo bdrnaﬁ
few -months ago. ‘ 

To the accompaniment of roars, Screech,
howls and grunts from animals in nearby "cage
the ﬁremen made short Work of the blaze," whi
scorched the buffalo house in therear of the pan
Police believe the ﬁre may have been started by;
a careless smoker. .. » I \, = x 5

EXPERTS PLAN THIRTEEN-MONTH YEA _
The calendar reform experts of the League‘ oﬁ
Nations, according-_ to current reports, are  ‘~
slowly but surely to the conviction that the
should be divided into thirteen months of equal:
length instead of the present system of twelvb
months.’ , ' . ’ 
By this system each month would have twenty
eight days, and the day needed to completethe
365 would be added to the endof Deceinber, "
twenty-ninth day, becoming the eighth day. of .
last week of the year.  '
The new thirteenth month would be inserted ‘b
tween June and July and, presumably, would 
called a solar midyear month. Whengleap, " V
arrives the scheme provide for the insertion of
aii"'?extra day at the end of June tobc known
an international .holiday. "5 ‘
It is understood that the committee, whic
ready has reached a tentative -agreement. I,
Easter should be ﬁxed for the second Sunday‘
April, probably will have two other plans of 2’-¢a_
endar reform presented to it. ;, j e 
‘These plans probably will be offered by'.W'
H. Booth, American delegate on the com ,
and by representatives of'the Catholic, the G3: ‘
Orthodox and the English churches. The ’ﬁi;"
would keep the calendar as i-t is with the ﬁxa" “
howevergof a degnite date for Easter. The
0nd would revise the present months so that’ 
quarter‘ of the year — would contain ‘ninety?
days, the extra day being inserted by agreenfen-t.
. The prog'1‘aI¥.1 of the committee is to‘submitj
advantages and’ disadvantages of all plans plaﬁ
before it to the Transit Committee of then
and to all interested -bodies. such,‘as7gover“ ‘
churches. business and educational organiz 
It is hoped thus to awaken public opinion‘ to
necessity of doing‘ something to overcome‘ tvha
