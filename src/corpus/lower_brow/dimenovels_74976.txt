  CHAPTER I.-——The Girl in the Case.

- ,“Gee! What a little peach-! I wonder who she
 is, and what brings her here?” said Tom, Gibson,.
 messenger to Littleby & Mallisdn, stock brokers,
; of No. -- Wall Street,,as he got up from his
E chair and advanced toward one of the loveliest-V
’ girlshe had ever seen. ‘

‘ She was about seventeen, modest in her deport-
ment, and she had entered the oﬂice in a timid
' gand difﬁdent way.

"What can I do for you, miss?” asked Tom,
‘with unusual deference and politeness, much im-
pressed by the girl’s good look and air of reﬁne-
ment. '

 “Are you connected with the oﬁice?” she‘ said,
in a sweet voice;

“Yes, miss; I have the honor of being the mes-
tiger of this establishment,” he answered with

“Yes, sir,” replied the young messenger, coming
forward. J 

“Conduct Miss Eastlake into my office, ‘and then
await my return here,” said the broker, who then, “
bowed to the girl and «continued on into the '
counting-room. '

“This way, miss,” said Tom.

The girl hesitated, then followed the boy. ‘

“Take that seat, miss,” said Tom, pointing to,
the one beside Mr. Littleby’s deck. ,, I
l She did, so, in a slow, undecided way, and the
boy walkedyout of the room and shut the door. \.~ 1

“So she’s John Eastlake’s daughter!” he mute’ _
t-cred, as he stood waiting for the senior boss to:
reappear. “Who’d have thought he had such 8_'
pretty .one? Well, she has my sympathy, for if
her father’s luck doesn’t mend he’ll soon be re‘-
duced to a steady diet of snowballs, and she'll no}. ‘
doubt have to suffer with him, which will be rough,
on her. What else can you expect when a man‘
takes to. drink?. Instead of -‘keeping tab on his:
deals, he goes off to some cafe and puts in his
time there. I have noticed that Mr. Mallisonf
encourages him to drink, which, in my opinion‘,
isn’t just the right thing for him to do. I’ye sus-

working some game on him. At any rate,’ his-'
money flows into this oﬂice with aregularity that
would break a millionaire if he kept it up long-V
enough. It is not my business how he blows his .
coin, and yet since I've seen his daughter, I feel. 3
as if he ought to be warned, if only for her sake."
Mr. Littleby bustled back. ' — , '
“Tom, put your hat on and run down to the’
Empire Cafe. You’ll probably ﬁnd Eastlake therl
Tell him his ‘daughter’ is here and waiting to Se’

He passed on into his room, while Tom passed,
out into the corridor, and was soon on the street.-

-, “ “That will never happen, sir,” replied the girl,
‘ ' proudly. “My father is a ‘gentleman and a man

' “You think so? Pardon me if I disagree with

T as well as the loss ofhis fortune, has had a
 very bad effect on him, just as it has had on
V many other men~._of even superior talents. I re-
gretto say he has taken to drink.”
~' The girl pressed her hand over her breast, and
it} look of intense fear-Wsettled in her‘ eyes. _
“I have been told that when he was young he
was ‘much addicted to liquor, and woul have
 filled. a drunkard’s grave only for the strong.in-
ﬂueiice your mother exercised over him. She
saved him and kept him from falling back into
«his old habits; but she could not kill the seed
l ‘lanted bynature in his system. As long as she
 ived, and as long as no great temptation aroused
the sleeping demon in his breast, he was safe.
.But.‘..the inevitable occurred, and today he is on
‘the road ‘to physical ruin and inevitable degrada-
tion, for when a man like him gets. onthe tobog-

to bay. by a messenger boy. Mallison was the
ﬁrst to recover his coolness. _ , ‘

“Littleby,” he said, in smooth tones, “I think.
we have failed to appreciate the unusual talents;
that Gibson appears to possess. It is never too‘
late, however, to recognize true worth. I thinly,‘

together, nor all the brokers in the Street comv‘
bined, haven’t money enough to buy_me.” 5

ing Tom in a state better imagined than

CHAPTER X.—Conﬁned.

7 It was certainly a tremendous surprise to Tom
’: toiﬁnd that he was to be detained in the room
‘ against his will. Such a state of things seemed
too astonishing for him to ﬁgure out. Why should
he be held a prisoner there? There must be some
reason, but to save his life he couldn't guess
W at it ‘Was. J
him, so the object of his conﬁnment would have
 to remain a mystery for the present.
. “It Wasbad enough for me to be out all night,
' but to continue away from the city today, and
perhaps for several days to come, is simply ﬁerce.
,-:‘Mother and the girls will be wild. They’ll have
the police looking" for _me; but the cops will never
think to look for’ me up here, if they take in-
. terest enough in the matter to look at all. Then
,I. won't be in town to keep my engagement with
Miss Eastlake tonight, and ‘she probably won't
.v beppleased at my failure to turn up. I wonder
; if I. could make my escape?” thought Tom.
 As the door appeared to be impassable, Tom

  

 
   
  
 

 

 
  
 
  
 
  
 

vrwere any chances in that direction. He was soon
satisﬁed that it wouldn’t pay to drop a matter
ibfathirty feet to the hard ground below. ' There
,was no safe way of escape’ from the window.
9 Evidently his jailor knew that or he would have
nailed the window up; 
 Tom spent an hour trying»to .pick the lock of
, the door with the small blade of his .penknife,
' but-met with nosuccess. He tested thethickness
of"the~p,anels 1: see whether he could smash one
with the stool b a blow or two, so that he could

So Tom seated himself at the window in nag; ’
cheerful state of mind, and waited for’ some-12
thing to turn up that might operate in his favoi-.5. '-
Nothing_turned up all that weary day. ,The_ 2!‘
house might have been vacant for all the sound"
that came from it; He didn’t see either the man“
or the boy anywhere around until the sun got
low down at the other end,‘ or front, of the house, a
then the husky boy went over to the well and
drew a pa1l_ of water. He looked up at the
third-story window, and seeing Tom's face there, i

grinned. V

Tom_ felt that it would be useless to t and
talk to him, so he made no eifort to 130 so.
Finally darkness came, by which time the young . =
messenger was mighty hungry, and then there
were steps on the. stairs once more coming up; i
The same two were doubtless coming, and Tom, 
presently saw the ﬂash of a light under the door.
The key was turned and the door opened cau— .
tiously. ' Bunker appeared with a cocked revolver , V.
in his hand. Evidently he was too foxy to be“ -7
taken by surprise by the prisoner making a sud-.
den rush. ‘ _ ,, W .

Had Tom attempted such a trick he would have ‘
found himself up against the muzzle of the wea- v
pon. The young messenger hadn’t considered.
such a move on account of the odds of two, and e .
was seated at the window when Bunker and J dnas '
appeared. The tray was again placed on the bed,
and he was invited to draw up and cat by the ,
light of a lamp which the man placed on the ﬂoor.
Tom, without uttering a word, tackled his‘ sup-
per, which consisted of some boiled meat and
potatoes, bread and butter, a piece of pie anda '._ 
cup of. coffee. A ‘ »  '  

It tasted good, and he made short worloz’-oflthe” 
Jonas then removedthe tray, Bunker shut‘, 
and locked the door, and once more Tom was left, 
alone. Tom spent another hour at the window, "
with his gaze on the darkened landscape and his ,;
thoughtsin New York, ‘and then he turned into ' '

than a week passe away, and Tom. found one ' v
day little different from another. He chafed atw"-5
the restraint, like_ a caged animal, but it did him ‘'
about as much good., . - ' 9
Several times he tried to engage the man -in;
conversation for the purpose of learningiwhat
was at the bottom of his imprisonment, but
Bunker had nothing to say.» He received‘ his two
meals a day with fair regularity, and. he could:
find no fault with his food. - i » ‘
“I wonder who’s putting up. for my board fo
the satisfaction of keeping me here?” he thought;
“It’s about time something turned up to letm
out .of this scrape. They say it’s a long lan,
that hasn’t a turning, but I don't see any turning
in my case yet in sight. If I don't get away ‘front
‘here pretty soon I may ﬁnd that deal of mine in
the soup. L. & M. ought to be booming about thi,
time." from the looks of things I'm not likely
to participate in it, .and the proﬁts‘ I counted to
scooping in will never comemy way.” '_'_;
As Tom had built great hopeson his .tip,~
made him mad to‘ think that he stoodya good show i
of ‘getting left on it. There was a closet» in the
room, but Tom had merely glanced jii, to!’

 of doing it. While casting his eyes around it he
, 9 noticed that the ceiling of it was just plain wood,
7 and that there was" a trap-door in it, leading,
 presumably, to the roof. _ ‘
’ _ “If ‘I could reach the roof I might ﬁnd a way
~ of escaping from the front," he thought.
..’ He had already discovered that his bed was

, ported by slats instead of a sprin frame. It

agility landed him on the roof. The roof had a
"gentle slop all around, so it was not dangerous
.’‘to crawl about on. He was now able to catch a
bird’s eye view of the surrounding country, and
he ound that the house fronted on a road, and
‘th there was a village about a mile away. Get-
‘ting the cardinal points of the compass from the
position of the sun, he soon made his calculation
of the direction in which New York lay. The
‘house was ﬁtted with three lightning rods at-
 tached to a single rod running down one of the
«front corners. After an inspection of this rod,
' Tom decided that a person with nerve could make
.his,way from the roof to the ground. It also
required good strong ﬁngers and sinew wrists,
for everything depended on the person sability
who hold on to the rod and sustain the weight of his
':'body by his arms alone, for there was no chance
‘ or the legs to assist. Practically it was a hand-
under-hand job, and Tom believed he was equal
to it.
\ ’.At any rate, he was willing to face considerable
‘risk to get away from his prison. As the chances
’ ofdiscovery might be considerable in the daylight,
Tom determined to undertake a risky feat after
dark. It would actiially be no harder in the dark
an’in the daylight, for the route was straight
ahead, without obstructions. Having taken an
ccurate survey of the rod, and calculated the
chances, Tom returned _to the room and replaced
ost of the slats in their former positions. ‘Then
sat down to await the appearance of his sup-

‘ ‘dual was taking no chances with his prisoner.
Tom ate it in silence and then the tray was
moved and he was left alone as usual. The
all Street boy was not going to spoil his chances
“escape by being in too much. of a hurry. He
'ded to wait a couple of hours before return-
ing to the roof. He felt conﬁdent that he would
-,}lie'able to give his jailer the slip, and he meant
report his imprisonment to the police of the
e he had seen from the roof, and have the
~ in and boy arrested. , , .

went to the closet to see what the prospect was.

for leaving them out of his calculations was be: 

 

*‘ cause they had been too foxy to give .him the '

faintest idea that they contemplated getting back »  ‘
at him for butting into their business. They had.
endeavored to throw him off his guard by pre-
tending to draw out of the Eastlake matter— " 
Littleby refraining from even calling on Elsie
until the boy had been disposed of—and’ their,
plan had worked out very well. When Tom judged
that sufficient time had ela sed, he once more re-
covered the slats from the id, and by their aid
made his way to the roof through the trap. It
was a fairly bright night, though there was no
moon, and there was no fear of the boy making.

He was now fairly embarked on his dangerous ' ~
journey of forty odd feet. ‘ . e

“If I lose my grip now it will be all up with. 
me,” he muttered as he lowered himself hand- '“' ‘*
under—hand. . ,

It would not do to let himself slide, as the rod 
had four edges, on which he would be pretty sure °
to cut his ﬂesh to the bone. It was necessary to * _
keep his wits about him, proceed slowly ‘and care- .
fully, and ieave the issue to the strength of his‘
muscles. He felt conﬁdent they would stand the .
strain, though he was bound to hear fromthem
afterward. Down--down he went, the weight on »
his arms increasing every moment. When he
reached the second story he felt he would give
anything for a rest. He decided he would try to
reach the ledge of the nearest window with his __;
foot and threw his weight on it. He swung his
left leg out and touched it. , , 

Then he forced his side against the wall and , 
managed by a great effort to maintain his balance ‘_
in _a v.ry awkward position. It accomplished his. ’ 
obgect, for it relieved his arms of the strain, and ; ~
rested them. He stood in this position several
minutes, like an insect clinging to‘ the wall, and ~
then continued his progress downward. At a
distance of ten feet from the ground his right-“
shoe struck a slightly projecting brick and he got ..
another rest, but onlya partial one. After going
down a few feet more he was close enough to the
ground to take the chances of a backward jump
He landed safely, with freedom before him.

 the other e recognized, with a gasp of surprise,
‘as Edward-Mallison. ~
.— Like ‘a ﬂashhe understood the meaning of his
’  imprisonment. He was the victim of his design-
ing employers. * i
‘ “The rascals!” he muttered. “So this is the
. way they get back at me. All right, I’ll ﬁx them
~for it. They think with me out of the way they’ll
" ‘have a clear ﬁeld to work their purposes against
 Miss Eastlake and her father., ‘Well. I’ni_ free,
, and I shall treat them to a nice little surprise.”
He was treated to a nice little surprise himself,
however, for at that moment a pair of stout arms
chciiilcled his body and he was yanked off his
erc .
 f He struggled to escape, but his captor held him
 . ast.~-. ,
‘ " V “I’ve got you, he, he, he!
from me. Back you’ll go _to your r00my _
betyou don’t get out again,” cried the voice of
Jonas in his ear. ' i
It was certainlv hard luck to be recaptu_red on
the threshold of freedom, and Tom was as mad as
‘a hornet. He wasn’t going to give up without a
"desperate struggle. He was up against a husky
. lad, older than himself, but the fellowrwasn’t near
~, as active or clever. He depended on his muscle,
 and having secured a bear’s grip on Tom, he had
-'all the advantage in his favor. But he had to
maintain it to conquer the stalwart Wall Street
 boy.’ Finding that. the ‘more he struggled’ the
 tighter "Jonas hugged him, Tom. stopped. ‘
_' “I thought you’d give in,” chuckled the husky
youth, with reat stisfaction. “I saw you come
‘down that ligﬁitning-rod, and laid for you. Gosh!
‘but you’ve got a nerve. I wouldn’t do it for a,
' , hundred dollars.” . _
 '~ Evidenly Jonas regarded $100 asla small for-
‘ tune. . I \
' “I was out

While Jonas was speaking, his grasp on Tom

Bunker. andthey came to the window and looked

The two young people spent
a very enjoyable evening in each other’s com-

_ He said he came

Tom recognized Dunne as the second book-

J _ Littleby.’ That gen-
tleman said he had heard he had turned up after
having been reported as missing from, his home

 for the last eight days, and he wanted to know

why Tom had not come to the oﬁice that day.
‘Gee! He’s got a colossal nerve to try and
bluff things out, just as if he didn’t know where

- . I was, and why I was away,” said the boy. “He’1l

wait a long time before I report, you can bet
your life.” *

; " Next morning as Tom was standing in front
" of \the Exchange he saw Mallison coming along.

‘The broker's sharp eyes singled him out and

I ‘ he came up to him.

“Are you coming back to the office, young

‘ man?” he asked, watching Tom intently,

‘ “No, sir, I’m not,” replied the boy. ‘
.-“Why not?” . .
.- “You ought to know.”
“Why should I?”
“What’s the use of pretending ignorance, Mr.

- Mallison. You know that the cause of my absence

during the last few days was a put—up job on the

~ part of you and Mr. Littleby.”

‘ "Nonsense 1”

 ‘V “No nonsense about it.’ It’s a fact. I require \
 no further proof of it than having seen you the
‘ night before last talking to my jailer in the front

“I did.”

“You must be crazy, young man.” '

Your little game was not aasuccess. It gave me a
lot of inconvenience, but that is all it amounted

- to. It didn’t'help Mr. Littleby in his scheme to

force Miss Eastlake into a marriage with him.

 with me, so I do not consider myself any longer '

Tom spoke. in a determined way that impressed '
Mallison with theidea that his words were no 
idle ones. ._ "  
“Look here, Gibson, you've got the whip hang '
of us, in a way. Let us conieyto an u_nderstan_ -' »-

you must be aware that I have the power to coerce ‘
him when I choose to exert it. Ngw, I’ aim ‘

has happened.” ._ V - V -
“It’s a bargain,” said Mallison. “I'm"a am

CHAPTER ‘XIV\'.—Conclusion. -

The next time Tom called on Elsie he told‘ her .
about the agreement Mallison had made with ,hi1i'I.. "
_ “I’ve an_ idea you’re safe from further Amolesta-V-‘,..
tion on Littleby’s part,” he said. “Mallison is" -
not interested in his love matters, and'won’t let '
it interfere with business. He can make Little
knuckle down to his wishes, and as it iseto his
interest to do so, I guess he has laid the lei,
down to -his partner in a way that has settlevg
the matter.” _ . "
“I hope so,” replied the girl. ‘I shall ‘always
be grateful to you for the interest you have taken”
in me and my father, and neither of us will ever
forget it.’ I .  ,«
A few days afterward Tom thought he saw"Ii,‘ .2
chance‘ to increase his store of dollars by bu ‘ ‘
N. 3' 0. _ He bought 400 shares of the sg  ,
'75, held it a‘week, and then sold out at a proﬁt»
of about $6 a share. That little coup raised X
capital to $7,000. He told Elsie about‘hi_s goo’ '

gage, he would lend him the money, or a per?
of it, to pay Littleby. , " "  .,,

didn't look for another position, but spent a
‘portion of‘ his time at the little -bank in Nassau
