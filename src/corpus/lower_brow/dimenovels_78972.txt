 NICK CA1?{’l‘l:IR WEEKLY. ‘

“You know as well as I know, Mr. Carter, how utterly
impossible it is that Princess'Deehrh and- the man she
loves should ever wed without the full consent and -ap-
proval of his majesty, the king. The time was when
Deehra believed that by losing herself utterly, and con-
cealing her identity for three years at least, the search
for her would pass and‘ she would be forgotten. But
that time, if it ever existed, is past. Even if it could
have been accomplished at the time she ﬁrst sought to

 escape from the court,* it is impossible now. I believe
it was always impossible. , ‘

“But it- seems to me that there is a wayin which the
princess can ultimately be made happy; a way in which
she and the man she loves may be brought together; a
way in which they may wed with the full consent of the-

i.king~but that way, if it exists, lies through you alone.
‘ .“I have asked you in that other letter please not to
search for us; I repeat that request here, feeling that I
I can depend upon you to grant it. I know that your
impulse will be'to abandon the whole thingiirat once,’ to
return to your own country and leave us to work out our
_ destinies by4ourse1ves,,but again I‘ want to beg you not
 L to do that. ’

much inﬂuence over the king as you have exerted since

21,, you have been here, and it occurs to me now that you s

might, if you choose, make use of it in the interest of all:

concerned, in a way that has perhaps not yet occurred

to'you, and that might not at all, if it were not sug—
gested. . ,_ , ,

A ,' you have said you know‘ personally, although itis long

since\you have seen him, is descended from a younger, —

branch of one of the oldest and ‘noblestéfamilies in this
7 kingdom. ,lHe has already resigned from the United
States army, in order to prepare himself for the mar.—

‘riage with the princess, which those two had foolishly.

Supposed might some time take place after Deehra had
succeeded in losinglher identity. Asif she ever could!
, “Mr. Carter, it would only take the scratch of a pen
in the ihandloi his majesty the king to restore ‘Major

‘ that his family once enjoyed. The king can make of

Richard Hartwell what he pleases, and if the king is dis-
’ ‘ posed to have his daughter near him, if he is disposed to
end all this unhappiness in the right way, and as a father
shouldend it,\_ I think that perhaps he could pbeinduced
I {to make those pen—scratches, and to rnake it possible‘, for

CHAPTER , V.

THE CAPTAIN’S VVORD OF HONOR.

The detective found the prince anxiously awaiting his
return from the royalaudience, which had lasted such
a considerable time that the anterooms were ﬁlled when
Nick passed through them on his way out.

“The child is born, and it’s a boy,” said Nick, laugh-
ing, as soon as they were alone. “We are going to
Christen it Count Von Hartzwold.”

“What in the world are you talking about?” asked the
prince, with a puzzled expression on his face, but, never-
theless, greatly relieved to ﬁnd the detective in such ap-

parently good humor with himself and all the world

(besides. '

“I’ll.tell you something that will interest you,” replied"

Nick. “I don’t suppose you would regard it as probable
..«that‘Countess Zita could have reminded me of some-
thing that I had clean forgotten before I knew her;

' would you?” I
i “In your present state of mind, Nicholas, I would re-

.’ what you are talking about.” ~
“Well, I have already told you that "I am quite well
 I acquainted with Richard Hartwell?” '.
;j ' “Yes.” ' *
“Once upon a time, along time ago, while in a conﬁ-
. dential mood, the major——he was/then «a lieutenant—told
‘ me something about the history of his family. It was
that that I had forgotten until the countess reminded me
I of ‘it this morning.” I ' I
I “Oh! You are not very lucid, but I will be patient. I
don’t suppose you have happened to see the countess this
. . morning, have you ?” .

“No; but she sent me a second note that you knew
nothing about; and in that note was a suggestion that
reminded me of Hartwell’s”family history.”

“May I ask what all that has to do with the present
ﬂdilemma P” 1 ’

out of all the difficulty would be to restore the title and.

estates of the Hartzwolds to Richard, and then to bestow
the hand of Princess Deehra upon the young count.” ’

to his consent, but they will be easily met. The thing is

A CLUE WHERE LEAST EXPECTED.

The day was bitingly cold, and yet the air was invig-
orating; suddenly the detective turned upon I-Iensau
again, and with an abrupt change of the subject said to
him: _ V
V “I wonder if you would do me a favor, captain? ‘I
1 ‘:wonder‘ if you would procure me a good saddle-horse so
that I can take a ride? I——~'--— What is the matter?”
“Nothing at all, sir.” i i ii i
 “Oh,‘al1 right. Can you get me a horse; and have it
 here in ﬁfteen minutes!’-’ “
I ,i“Certainly, sir.” i « , ,
.i“The exercise willtstir my blood up a bit, I think.”
 Nick watched the captain of the guards as he walked

~ there was a smile of understanding on the faceiof the de~
‘ ‘vtective as he did so. i M _

He had just asked himself that question when Prihcei

Rupert came outside the palace and approached him. ,

“Captain Hensau, whom I just met inside, tells me that

you are going for airide, Nicholas,” he said. “Shall*I 

accompany you?” i
“I would be delighted if you would; certainly.”

“I have told him to fetch’ my two favorite’ horses.’
Where were you going ?’,’

“To tell you the truth, I wasn’t going anywhere in par- 
ticular. Iionly wished to stir mybloodup a bit, to feed
my brain so that I could think. Rupert, if the princess’ I
and the countess happened to leave theicity last night on 

horseback, which way would they have gone?”

“Bless you, I haven.’t='an idea 1”
“Where could they have gone?”

“Why, they might have gone almost anywhere, 

you think?”

“I mean, where is there another place like Cast1e_Liri-

CHAPTER IX.

$1‘.  MOATED CASTLE OF Zt)LLERN_.

A: message arrived from Paris before _morning to the v 
effect that the chief would undertake to accomplish "what
had been asked of him, but it,warne‘il the detective that
the hour could not be ﬁxed. _An opportunity would have .'.
to be sought, andat the moment of sending the message
the chief had not had time to think upon the matter. 4

   
  

       

    
 
  
   
   

beiore Nick Carter could expect his Vlwishes to  ful-‘

the message that would arrive later, telling at,what~.t.ir_n
to expect the .‘.‘prisoner” at the frontier; ‘ M M ’  i

   

“During those two or three days,” the detectiv.e,an-

“Yes. Notwithstanding the horror of the place that
the princess feels, it would be just the one that the
countess would select in which to hide until the first
search is past.” .

“But the princess ran away particularly to avoid being
sent to that very place.”

“All the more reason why Zita should select it as the
most unlikelyuplace for any search to be made for them.”

“Possibly.”

“And, besides, there is a whole lot of difference be-
tween being a prisoner in a place and being there of your
own free will.” ' V 1

“That is true.”

I" “So Ilthink that, after all, I shall ﬁnd them at Zollern.

However, in order to cover the ground thoroughly, I shall.

“Do you desire my company on this expedition, Nick?”
“Very much, indeed, and I regret that I cannot have
“Why can’t you have it? I should be delighted to go
with you.” Y I _
“I am assured of that also; but you will agree with me
that it is quite necessary that one of us should be here

 - V in the palace in case Hartwell should arrive sooner than

wetnow expect. If he is brought here before my return,
it will be necessary for you to stand between~the king
and the facts. In other words, the king must not know
the facts until we are prepared to reveal them. He must
not know them until I have smoothed Hartwell’s feath-

‘ ers.”

“I ‘understand. You are right.”
“I wishuto help myself out of your stables. I shall’ go

“Let me suggest one thing.”

“What is that?”

“Carry with you in your pocket that parchment com— '~
mission that the king gave you, and also do not fail to ' '
wear the emblem of the Order of the Golden Eagle. You
may need them both before your return.”*

“Thanks for the suggestion. I_ will do both.”

“At I-Iartzwold you will certainly need them, for, as I

have already told you, the castle is in charge of the 

crown, and there is a caretaker there who ‘will not be

disposed to admit you without an order directly from the

chancellor.” * i I
“And at Zollern? What am I likely .to ﬁnd there I”

“Zollern is used nowuionly as a hunting—lodge in the
mountains and forests. The king rarely goes there. To _
my certain knowledge, he hasnot visited the castle for '

 

three years. But the order on your breast and the com- 
mission in your pocket should act likemagic upon who—~‘ 3
ever is in charge.” A, V A .

True to his word, the "detective left the palace at day-
break, riding one of the prince’s horses and leading an-
other one; and by nightfall he rode into the court before ~ 
the castle of Hartzwold. ’ ‘ I J‘

The readiness with which he was admitted by the care-
taker, however, convinced him at once that those he, i '
sought were not there, and so he made only a cursory '
examination of the interior, pretending that hislmiss/ion I
was merely one of curiosity. ,_ V A

And the castle was well worth all‘ the curiosity that *5
might havebeen devoted to it. ‘ ‘ 1 ' I

. It was a massive pile of masonry, standing 3.llTlOSt[_r3t'
the pinnacle of a mountain, and commanding a view fbrg
many miles in every direction. And the estate was; a.
lordly one for young, Hartwell to become possessed of.

 

 
   
    
  
   

“Fortune is knocking at that young man’s door, and I
he doesn’t know it,” mused the detective as he retired ' I
to rest, leaving strict injunctions that he was to be for. if
warded on his way at daybreak. V i I
