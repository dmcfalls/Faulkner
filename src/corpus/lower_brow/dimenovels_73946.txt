CHAPTER I.—Bob and Dick.

:§“.I..o‘frd Dick, I don’t think I ever saw the board
com in such an uproar as it is at this moment,
and has. been since it opened for business”, said
‘Bob; B;-own,_mes‘senger for old John Hopkins,
stockbroker, of_.No.» Wall Street. ,

?n‘fTh8‘E§5-*/right, Bob. It’s like Bedlam- broken

._ose. “
 in. .~!&“,M._ [Have you sold your
‘f twenty shares yet? If you haven't, I advise

‘b1iere’s no telling what may happen inside of the
ext hour,” replied Dick Smart, messenger for
orrest, Robinson & 'Co.

_,:5‘No, I haven't sold yet, but I’m going to drop
 the little bank on my way back to the oﬂice
‘ind order it sold_ right away. At present quota-
.'_ons.I stand to win $28 a share, and that was
more than I expected to make outof the deal.
Have you got’. rid of your ten shares?”

“Two hours ago. I’m not taking any more
hances than I'can help. ' I cleared something over
$20. a share, and I’m satisﬁed with that. «I don't
béiieve in being hoggish,»and hanging out for the

neck.” '

1 “They do for a fact. I’m on pins and needles
fyself ‘for fear a slump might set in -before I get
the little bank.” I . _

‘.-‘Or .a combined bear raid might be started
g?’2finst' the stock,” suggested Dick’.
" Bob nodded.
And if it wasn’t well supported by the bulls,
prices would; be slaughtered right away.”
‘That Wbuld start a panic as sure as you live.”

right’ thing for him to do. Edna Prescott,‘ Mr."
Iippkins’ stenographer, came in" earlier than
«usual, for she had a lot of work ahead of her,
,-and she wanted to clean up some of it before her
einployer came down. The rest of the employees
[were not so eager to get to their desks and did
r not turn up a second before the time limit. The
girlgave Bob a smile and a “good morning” as
ﬁshe passed, into the counting-roorn, and ﬁve min-
-utes afterward the young messenger went in, too,
and stopped at her desk. ‘
V f‘You’re gotyour hands full, I see, so I won’t,
bother you,” he said.
"~“‘Oh,. you aren’t bothering me. I can work and
‘.331’ you talk at the same time,” she replied, for
he likedyto have the boy around. ,

He had, made himself pretty solid with her by
‘ ing many favors for her. -Then Bob was a
polite, gentlemanly boy, who never got “fresh”
with her like two or three of the clerks tried to

, . E _’,“.1’m thinking this is going to be another strenu-
V [.0115 day on the Exchange,” said Bob. “.-Ever since
fM,onday,». when the market began booming like a
house aﬁre, the boardroom had been in a fever of
excitement. Yesterday afternoon, had you been
. in the. allery, you’d have thought a combination

iootbalff match was under way on the ﬂoor. In
I 5 it was like a riot on a small scale. It's a
fiiﬁder tome that some of the traders don’t go
under with heart failure in the, rush. I guess
.» there can't be many weak hearts among the bro-
kers. The 0. & M. boom is the biggest thing that
has hit the street this year. Lots of people are
making money out of it;,but there is sure to be a
reaction pretty soon, and’ then a wholelot of the
speculators, as well as regular traders; are going

fur things to—day, but this is hoodooday in Wall

utes later Bob was sent on»his first errand of the "
day. ‘By that time the b1'0kE1‘S"OfﬁC6S were ﬁlling
up with customers, and not a few, as Bob had
congectured, were giving in their selling orders
because they feared that something might happen
on that fateful day. When Bob returned to the
oﬁice Mr. Hopkins had gone to the ‘Exchange.
Fifteen. minutes later he was sent with a note to
him. He was not surprised to ﬁnd the boardroom
in aiturmoil as strenuous as that of the precede
in;:» afternoon. The bears had unexpectedly de- 3
veloped fresh strength and were making a des- .;'
pei-ate fight for the ascendancy. . ‘ 
The bulls were ﬁghting them off; but their “ 
position was not so strong as on the preceding ‘ ’
day. Bob was back_ and forth -between the office 
and the lxxchange vwetn not out on other errands. ~
He scarcely had a momciit’s rest from the time 
he started out on his first errand. He met Dick ‘V '-
Smart twice on the street, but neither had time . '
to more tnar greet each other and pass on. "At  i
two o'clock on his way back‘ to the oﬂiee Bob felt . ‘V
so hungry that he dro}5ped into a quick-lunch V
house and called for a sandwich and a cup of 
coffee. He swallowed both at railroad speed. Just 
as he slipped down off his stool and put his hand
in his pocket for the dime to settle at the aashie/r-’s
window, a cruple of boys dashed into the place ‘;

e 1  ‘VCHAPTER V.-—Bob Gets Hold of a Tip.

I _ .-A few days after the old broker had been laid
_ iiwa in his last resting-place, Bob began to_in-
‘vestigate the value of the securities in the Jap-
anned tin box. _ _ _
V gHe prosexcuted his inquiries chieﬂy after_he’ was
through with his duties at tlie_oﬁ'ice, which em-
braced not only messenger service, but desk work
.,as: well. '
 He found that the certiﬁcate for 10,000 shares
of = Sunrise Mining & Millin.g_stock was worth
~ nominally $500; but the question was to ﬁnd a
{purchaser at that ﬁgure. _
, A Broad Street broker, to whom helapplied for
—' information about the stock, offered him $250 for
the certiﬁcate, but Bob declined to sell it below
its quoted value. _ . .
'.He found out the address of the Phoenix Opti-
‘cal Co., in Philadelphia, and wrote to the sec_re-
ary telling him that he had come into possession
of 5,000 shares of the company’s, stock, and re-
, questing him to let him know what_it was worth.
 In due time he received a reply informing him
j that the stock was of rather uncertain value at
‘ present,—as the company was not yet in a ﬁnan-
cial? position to declare its first dividend.
' , He advised Bob’ to forward the certiﬁcate so
‘ that the stock could be trans_fe_rred to his name on
g the.company’s books, promising to return it in
._due course. i _ .
_ g “The company,” he wrote, “has acquired and 1S

Bob sent on the certificate and decided that the
stock might turn out o_ be a valuable asset in
time. When he looked. into the Excelsior Coppe
Mining Co. of Montana, he foundfthat the mil;
person who could give him any information on’.
the subject was the proprietorof a mining bureau ’
on Grand Street, named Isaac Blum. He visited
Mr. Blum’s oﬂice about one o’clock on Saturday
afternoon and found a‘ young clerk. in charge.
%“}1al'. individual told Bob that Mr. Blum was out
est. . - i 
“We haven't had any call for Excelsior Copper
in several months,” he said. “I couldn’t tell you
what it might bring if we found a customer who
wanted some of it... It is not listed on an 01? the
exchanges, and therefore has no quotab e price.

cents. Our minimum commission on any deal» 
$51.25. How many shares of Excelsion Coppe

“Fifteen thousand,” replied Bob. i -,
“That’s ‘quite a block. Will I take down your‘
name and address, or shall you call again and 8
Mr. Blum?” V g  «‘
“I will probably call, but you can take my name‘
and address, anyway.” _ . in - /9%
The clerk took Bob’s name, his office addres ,
and the number of shares of Excelsior Copper he
owned, and then the young messenger We,Iit'awa.'y
not much impressed with the possible value of the
stock. The certiﬁcate that interested Bob more}.

 

than any other was that calling for 40,00‘0'sh'ares ‘

of the Eldorado Banana Corporation. The reason
of this was because he was much taken withthe
glowing prospectus issued months before by ’the
company when in the hands of its promoters. This
prospectus Bob‘ found folded up with “the certifl-1

cost $15,000 and extended two miles along a cer-

good reasons were given why the stock, offered.
both for cash at a discount and on the instalment
plan of ten payments, at 20 cents a share, would
prove a highly proﬁtable investment. Pictures
reproduced from photographs were given of di ~.
ferent parts of the plantation‘, of the port of Ceiba
and neighboring Honduran scenery. There was
also an entertaining description of the-.ban'ana
industry from which Bob ‘learned thatsixty riiille

annually to the United States. The company
promised a dividend in ten months; so Bob wggte
to the New Orleans address to see what he c'ul,i:l

While awaiting a reply to his letter he looked»
up the other‘ stock of his legacy from theold bro

wouldn’t mind Walking with him a few blocks,
provided I needed an escort; but when an old —
man’ like Mr. Wessel gets himself up like a fash-
ion plate I simply can’t‘be seen in his company.”

“Well, I can't blame you feeling that way. I
think he's got a lot of nerve to .force his society I
on you after office hours,” said Bob. “He hires
your services as a stenographer and typist for a .
certain sum a week. He is only entitled to what , 
he pays you for. If he doesn’t cut his personal -
attentions out I’d look for another job if I were
you. ’« I ' ‘ j

‘‘I mean to right away. I don’t ‘care for him_ ' "
as an employer, and the sooner I can makeiai
change the better I’ll be pleased,” replied Edna; .

They walked down the three ﬂights and then 
went out by the Pine Street entrance to avoid the \
possibility of meeting Wessel and Hopwood at the
main door.

Bob was seated on his high stool before his desk, -
,Monday morning reading the “Wall Street Ar.’-
gus” when Hopwood came in. ‘

_‘‘Good morning, Mr. Hopwood,” said the boy,»
with his customary courtesy. _ - x  ,3‘ 

Hopwood growled out some kind of a reply and: 
glared‘ at Bob in an unfriendly way. He went to "
the safe, opened it, took out the books and papers,
he and the boy‘were working on, and then called; V
Bob‘ to'come and get those he was using. He‘
seemed on the point of saying something, but‘)'e~
considered the matter, and Bob carried one of the
books and several of the papers to his desk. The 
boy knew he was sore on him because he had,-_
called after Edna on Saturday and they had
skipped down the stairway together instead‘ of
waiting for anlelevator. Of course, Hopwood had
seen that it was Edna who dragged Bob down
the stairs, thereby showing her eagerness’ to get
away from Wessel and himself, but as he couldn't‘
get back at the girl, it would have pleased him to
get square with Bob, whom he blamed as_a«bntie .
ter-in.. He laid his own work out on his desk,’ 
he didn’t get down to business like his assistant.
_ ‘ He took upa morning newspaper and read ﬁlly?

A “Oh, my friend Morgan is going to back me

"Is that so?” chuckled one of the messengers.
f"Why don't you ask him for ﬁve or ten million
while 'you’re about it?” 1

main corridor. .

. idding them about hiring an ofﬁce, or even desk
~ robin in somebody else’s office. They looked on
‘7Bob as’ a messenger still, and messengers were
notpin the habit of hiring offices ‘for themselves
when_they lost their jobs. When they reached
 the'str‘eet they scattered, and Bob returned to his
'own place of business with an answer from the
broker he had taken the note to. This he handed
tothe assignee, and then after a glance at the
tape; which showed that J. & N. was up to 85, he
feturned to his desk. At half-past twelve he went-
to lunch, looking at the ticker on his way out. The
stock he ‘was interested in, was now going at 90.
He” decided. that he wouldn’t_ take-any more
' ‘ ‘ ' ' so before going to’ the restaurant
he frequented, he ran into the little bank and
ordered his shares sold. Whenvhe got back to
the oﬂice he saw tlyat J. &. N. was ruling at 91.

CHAPTER VIII.—Bob,'Hires AnyO{l'ice. ’
, About a week after the end of the J .' & N. boom
-_.assig'nee had wound up the business of the
’_‘_t"ejMr..Hopkins so liar that he found it unneces-
'  to longer retain the office or the three em-
"loyees who had helped him out. Accordingly,
&r. True, Hopwood and Bob were paid pﬂi to the
e31d.of-‘the ‘week and told that their services were
”mo ,longer.needed. The furniture,’ safes’ and other
riiishings werehsent to an auctioneer s place to
‘sold to the highest bidder, and the name Of
1111 Hopkins was removed from the door, thus

He captugred 1;

‘‘What’s your name?”

“Simply as a private office.”

“What business do you intend

“I intend to buy and sell stocks.”

after one he was back in Mr. Rider’s oﬂice. ~_—'_1‘hat

._wanted, and he got them for a ‘song.’ After pay-
ing his bill he hired an expressman to carry them
around to his office and put them in., Then he

V ‘arranged to have a ticker put in. Next morning

he brought down an oil painting of his late boss,

 and some other pictures he had saved from the

old broker's personal property at his apartment.
These he hung up. All he needed now was some

' ~ printing, books and stationery, which he ordered

from a Broad Street establishment.
Having nothing further to do, he went to the

I - gallery of the Exchange and remained there till

he-felt hungry, when he went to lunch.’ The rent
‘and furnishing of his office had cost him about

V’ . $650, but for seven months he would have very

little expense to meet. The actual rent of the
room was fully twice as much as he had paid,
both the assignee and Mr. Rider standing 3. part
, of it. Bob hoped to be so well ﬁxed by the first of

'1'May as to be able to meet the full rent easily, or

‘even toget a better oﬁice. Next day he brought
the tin box full of stock certiﬁcates downtown
and locked them up in the safe. That morning
he received his long over-due answer from the

. secretary ‘of the Eldorado Banana Corporation,

enclosing a copy of an encouraging letter from
the manager in charge of the plantation.

.'..He was informed that the‘ promised dividend
'had'been passed and the money applied to im-

.. proving the plantation so as to make the second
yearfs crop a record one. The secretary further
said that in accordancevwith his request the 40-,-

‘ ‘000 shares had been transferred to his name on

:the company's books, and the gentleman added

thatif he wished to dispose of any of the stock‘

'‘9

x a customer could readily be found for -it at 25
‘cents. a’ share. His 40,000 shares, therefore,
might be considered to have a cash value of $10,-
10,00, obtainable at any time, which was mighty
good news to Bob, who had not expected to be able
to-sell it for $500. In conclusion, the secretary
Iadvised him not to sell, as in a year he said his
stock ought to be worth double its present mar-
ketvalue. '

“My legacy is panning out prett well, after
'all’’, mused Bob when he ‘had rea the .-letter.
§?1\da.ybe in time some of the other stock will turn
V’ up trumps, too.” . _

After reading the news of the district in the
‘two Wall Street dailies he had subscribed for, he
‘put on his hat, locked up and Went around to call
‘on his‘ friend Dick Smart, whom he hadn’t seen

for over a week. Dick was just going out on an .

‘ rrand and Bob met him in the corridor.

\f“Héllo, old man, where ‘have you been _keeping_,

 “ I looked disappointed.

— _ without being able to say why, was a bit suspi-

cious of Mr. Blum's oifer.
- “An hour or two may be too. late, as I expect

= the man may be at my ofiice when I get back,”

said Blum energetically. “Better make up your

mind now to accept the offer, which is a good one ’

for the stock.”

“No, I won’t accept ﬁve cents. Seems to me it

 ., ought to be worth more than that. At that rate,
' my certiﬁcate would only bring $750, and from

that sum I'd have’-to pay you a commission of
one-half a cent a share, or $75, which would leave
me only $675.”

“I’ll throw oﬂ“the commission, as I'll get $75

 from the other party,” said Blum, in his quick,

snappy way. _ _ 

Bob, however, declined to sell, and his visitor

“May I use your ’phone?” he said.

“Certainly,” replied Bob. .

Blum called his oﬁice up and asked if Mr.
Beaseley was there. Presumedly Mr. Beaseley
was, or else Blum held a conversation with an
imaginary party or his clerk at_the other end.
Finally he turned to Bob and said his customer

' was willing to give six cents a share for the stock.

: l to my knowledge, and it may be another

“$930,” replied Bob.

J " This rise in price made the boy less inclined than

ever to part with his shares. He began to suspect
that there was a colored’ gemman in the woodpile,
so he‘de<:1ined_to sell for six cents.
, “You’r'e foolish, young man,” said Blum. “That
stock hasn’t sold as high as six cents for 9. year
ear be-
fore you get as good an offer again. A t ousand
dollars is not to -be despised.” H ’
“At six cents a share my stock represents only

I guess my customer will give the odd hun-

dred,” said Blum, resming his talk over the wire. .,

“Yes, he'll make it $1,000, and I won’t charge y

» any commission. What do you say?” , i

V “I think I won’t sell,” replied Bob. “I don't
need the money.” ‘ _
’ Blum tried hard to get him to reconsider his

determination, and when he wouldn’t, he got up

2 4and left the office.

‘ CHAPTER X.-—-Bob Picks Up Another Tip.

As soon as Mr. Blum had gone, Bob put on hj&
He directed his steps to the
ofﬁce of a well-known Curb broker with whom he
was acquainted. The trader happened to be in,
and Bob was shown into his private roo_m.
, l“Mr.‘Judd, you remember Ipwas speaking to you
some time ago about Excelsior Copper stoc ,"
said Bob." “I told you I had 15,000 s ares, and I
wanted to know what it was worth. You referred

 to Isaac Blum, manager‘of a mining bureau

on Grand Street, as being the person best qualiﬁed

'0 L to give me information about an unlisted stock

like Excelsior Copper, which yousaid was in no

demand on the Curb.” V _ ‘
The broker nodded, and then said:
‘fI:Iave you at the stock yet?”

“I have. I idn’t see Mr. Blum at the time, as ,

While Bob was waiting for the elevator, he no-
ticed an envelope lying on the corridor ﬂoor.‘ He
picked it up and saw that it,was addressed .-to
somebody in lead pencil. The envelope had been
stepped on, however, andthe name rendered‘uxi-
distinguishable. It was sealed, so Bob opened‘ it to’ ’
see if the man’s name was on the inside. »TIiix
is what he saw scribbled in pencil: '

D. Many traders had noticed Quinn's persis-

them had followed suit in anticiptaion of a rise.
The big broker, however, stopped buying as soon
’s the price jumped up a couple of points, and
eft the ﬂoor. The other traders hastened to sell
Tat the slight advance and succeeded in getting out
‘ at a proﬁt, and then the price dropped back
around 73 -again. Bob, seeing that operations in
19.1: D. had come to a, standstill, went to lunch.
On returning to the Exchange he found the big
‘broker back again buying as persistently as ever.
~'_£‘he price went up by degrees to 74, and then the
young :5 eculator left the gallery and went to his

Bob discovered that a s dicate of‘ millionaire

busy buying up the stock ofthe road wherever
they could ﬁnd it. The cause of this move was
said to be the action of thepresident of the Blue

board of directors, representing. many thousand

V‘ shares of v stock, objected to.

“ The“ 30th of Ma is a holiday as every one

market value both were worth’ about the same
amount, of $120,000. Dick nearly had a fit when:

few months later Bob received a dividend of ten
cents a share on his stock of the banana corpor "
tion, which now had an estimated value’ or ‘
cents a share,.with every prospect of going

wholly with Wade. Everybody liked the bluff
Westerner and his family.

Work had been stopped on the palatial mansion
on the hill. This caused Dugdale to chuckle
and remark: ._ -

“Pride sometimes has a fall. Perhaps Wade *
will sell that house for a song yet.” .

But Wade, quiet and, as genial as ever, was hard
at work. Hehad the ablest of detectives scour-
ing the West for evidence to support his own
claim and offset that of Dan Cliiford.

Monarch No. 4 had been called out to but few
ﬁres, and these Were all slight blazes and easily
extinguished. -

Mrs. Wade and Nellie were frequent visitors at
the Norton cottage. The most sincere of friend-
ships Vlliag sprung up between Mrs. Norton and

s. a e. < .

Nellie and Will thus met frequently, and each.
became conscious of a shy admiration for the
other. In Will’s eyes Nellie Wade was a feminine’
ideal. To her the boy ﬁreman was an exalted -
of hero. Which was ﬁtting, and all as it sh d
be. The story was one which is as old as the’
world itself. A '

But Will Norton was not the only youth in , .
Fairdale who was attracted by the charms of 
pretty Nellie Wade. She had a score of young
admirers. '

One of these was Clinton Dugdale. His cal-
culating mind had weighed her in the balance»'— — '
with other-[girls whom he knew, and he had be- «
come possessed of a resolve to make her his own.

While Clinton was, in the ordinary sense, too
young to think of marrying, yet he felt an en-
gagement would be quite proper, and when '
the proper time came he could claim Nellie Wade.
as his wife. -

His methods of wooing, however, were hardly of .
the chivalrous order. _ .-'—._.

He did not venture to approach the fair object 1 '
of his passions, for he had not even a speaking. '
acquaintance with her. He was suﬂiciently as- ;.
tute to realize that any overtures on his part. v
would be in bad taste at present. ’

He would wait until the present ﬁnancial ﬁght . . -
was settled. When the battle was over, then he-
would be in a better position topresent his suit.

“§he will be only too glad to marry me then,”
he reﬂected. “Indeed, I shall be to a‘ certain ex-
tent stooping to marry the daughter of a poor
man, but then she is quite the prettiest girl-in, 
Fairdale, and I can bring her up to our standard,.' .1 
I think.” ’ '* “ ’

_S_uch was the refreshing egotism of this young
scion of __a wealthy parent. His whole spirit was ,
steeped in arrogance and utter selﬁshness. '. ,-

It irritated him to see Will Norton in atten-" 5;,
dance upon Nellie Wade._ , . __ ' 2 “

At the ﬁreman’s ball Will was her escort. On, - 3"

The courtroom was crowded when the case
_ _was called. Dan-Clifford‘ and a dozen of his
. Western pals were present, and told an-apparently
straightforward story. .. » ‘
.‘‘Dave Collins ﬁrst located the claim and got
the,papers,” declared Clifford. “He"'”then sold‘
.— it to me.” _ A » ‘ , ~ \

.. I “What evidence have you to offer that you
, , really, owned‘ this mine? That .you bought it
  from Collins?” .
. “Two. men that witnessed the papers,” said
 Cliiford. “Two- others thet worked claims near
’ ‘ by an’ knew thet I owned it.”
' These men swore that this as true. v
 , ~,_r“I went away to the Klondike,” declared Clif-
’ —-ford. “While I was gone this man, Jim Preston,
2. sold the claim to Wade. He had no right ter do
«it, and he couldn’t give no clear title.’ The gold
.~ "—min-e belong~s.'to‘me, an_dgI_think I_’ve proved it.”
 j~_;W‘hen the defense was called it became evident
at ;once that Mr. Wade had a weak case.
. >"  ffThe man Preston, of whom I bought the mine,
' "’assured me that he owned it,” he said.— “I have
1 been told that he is dead, so I cannot fall back
upon him to prove my claim. I am certain that
, he was an honest man, and that he told me the
truth.” 3
Will Norton, who was among the spectators,
‘saw that the case was lost. While there was
‘no. doubt in hismind that Clifford's claim was
Tra fraudulent one, it could not be disproved.’ It
seemed a stronger claim than Wade’s, for it was
hacked by sworn witnesses. ‘ ‘ '
' The jury did not consider the case long. They
returned aftera short deliberation,‘ and awarded
V-a" verdict in favor of Clifford.
. ,B.ut the case was not yet ended. An appeal
, was ﬁled to a higher court; Wade was calm and
”self-possessed. As they were leaving the ‘court-
 room Will joined him.
 “I-’Cam_ verysorry, Mr.‘-Wade,” he began.
