mrned about the contract her father had
' \ with the syndicate that was going to put up

“Great Scott! father," he exclaimed. “Is that
-you?” ‘ « . , .

The man stopped and .stared at him in a. bewil-
dered manner. ‘ N

“Bob!” he cried _in a hoarse. voice. “You here,
my son?” . ,

Their hands met in a close grig, and bending
forwardthe forlorn looking intru er kissed Bob.
Will viewed the performance with the greatest
amazement. He’ could not possibly fanthom the
meaning of it. Indeed it was so astonishing that
it,‘ took his breath away.

“Father, what does this mean?" cried Bob, in
anxious suspense.

“It means, my son, that I and several others .

have escaped from the prison where I. was sent.”

“Escaped'." ‘ ‘ ' ’

“Escaped,” repeated his father. “I have been
traveling all night ever since I gave my compan-
ions the slin in the darkness, and skulking across
the fields and through the woods since sunrisein
momentary fear of being recaptured and taken
back to finish the long term that to an innocent
man is something worse than death. I did not
expect to ﬁnd you here, my boy, but I thank
heaven for this meeting, for I thought it might
be years before I could have the joy of seeing you
once more-.—-of clasping your ‘hands in mine. '

“Oh,/«father, to think that we should meet thus,”
said“ Bob, with great emotion. “You look worn out

and exhausted._ You mustbe hungry as well as. 4 ‘ 

footsore." . .
“Yes, I am hungry, my son. I have tasted noth-
ing since I partookof the meager prison supper
last night,” replied the man, wearily. . _ 4 .
"‘You ‘must not be seen, father," said Bob.
anxiously. “Come intothe barn, where you will
be safe for a time at least. _I will get you food
and drink. and then we will consider what is best
to’ be’ done. Officers" of the law‘ are doubtless.
searchingfthe country around about [for you and
the others who escaped with you. Some means
must be taken to hide you until the hue and cry

. isover. If not found by the authorities you may V
’ be able to make your way to Canada and begin “ -

life again under an assumed name." V
Bobpuslied open the barn door and led his

father inside. Then he thought of Will, who was

staring at them with all his eyes. .
“Will, come here," he said.

 

 

 

 

Pulling his friend inside and closingthe door " 

he said. .
“This is my father.” ,
“Your father!” ejaculated Will.
“Yes. Stay with him until I return."
Leaving them together Bob hurried across the

yard to the house where he found Kittie Carson,.

the maid of all work, in the kitchen reading a pa-
per. He and Kitty ‘were the best f friends, and
there was hardly anything the gi l wouldn’t do

for him, for he had taken her part several times‘

when abused by Mrs. Atkins.

“Kittie,” cried Bob, “I want you to dome ' I 

great favor.” , —
“I'll do it,” she said,_ dropping her paper. , ,

CHAPTER: IIIl4Harboring 5' Fugitive. "

While his father was eating Bob drew Will
aside, for he saw that he would be obliged to

make some explanation of this: remarkable state

of affairs.

The three men, who were clearly the"thre6
convicts who had escaped from the State peni-

gloom. I - _

_“Those rascals are going to rob some house in
this neighborhood," thought Bob, who had over-’ "
heard enough of their conversation to satisfy
him as to their identity and the purpose they had
in view. “It is _my,dii_ty to prevent them from ,
carrying out their rogect if I can, and secure 
their arrest. ‘They have helped my father; to es~ ' ‘

F ' They threw it up and looked inside. As there
- was nothing now to stop them from entering.the
kitchen they scrambled in one after the other,

. leaving the window wide open to facilitate their

- . retreat.
« ¢A:t‘ter waitingva few minutes Bob made his
wa over to the barn, entered and secured a stout
, , ‘ gel thatstood in a corner. With this weapon
he started for the house and let himself in by
the kitchen door, which he locked, and removed

the key’.

Looking into the kitchen he saw no signs of
the convicts so he shut the window and went into
the entry.

Here he stood in e dark and listened, his
heart beating quickly, for he knew there would

_ . soon be a rumpus in the house. He thought he

 , ‘heard sounds in the dining-room, and he made his
’ wax to the door, which‘ stood ajar. -‘

‘v , faint light shone through the crack and he
peered in.

A , The three men were in’ there, rummaging

 around. * . .
 They had lighted a candle to see by. Had there
,' been a key in the lock Bob would have closed the

other two convicts sto ped in consternation. The

never taking his eye off his prisoner, Bob pulled
the key of the kitchen door out of his pocket and
handed it to Will. Will lost no time in fetching
a bunch of thin rope, and during the interim
two other men boarders made their appearance,
half dressed, at the head of the stairs. On the"

second landing, or third ﬂoor, Mrs. Atkins was ”

trying to make her husband go down to the scene
of the disturbance, but he seemed loath to do so.
Naturally 0. timid man, his Wife had taken what-
ever courage he might have had out of him by
her brow-beating tactics, and now he was ab-
solutely useless as a protector.

Finally on seeing the three men at the head of

join them.

down in a wrapper.

“Is that man dead?" she asked, pointing at the

_ ‘.‘No, madam,” replied the gentleman in the pa}-.

young man Bob Brandon is a brave lad. He laid

the three rascals out alone without any help. He “ l ‘

deserves the thanks of all in the house, and he
shall have it if I have anything to say.”

Mrs. Atkins was surprised at Bob's nerve, and
congratulated herself more than ever in having
him about the house. Only for him the cottage
and the boarders might have been cleaned out of
everything of value. The unconscious man was
lifted from the stairs and carried out to the
kitchen where he was propped up on the floor.
The other wounded man was placed in a chair
there, while the third fellow was deposited in a
corner, bound hand and foot.

“You better

“I don't know where he lives," replied Will.

“Then get Mr. Atkins to go.
and you'll have the rig ready for him when he

she was the boss. She immediately ordered her
husband to get ready and go for the constable.

he looked as if he stood. greatly in need of the

In order to get around it Bob said. he was

“saw the three men approach ‘the house, and re-
' gardingtheir actions as suspicious he had dressed

Ordinarily Bob scorned to tell a lie, and would
soo-ner take the consequences of any act of his
than try to evade it by a false statement. But
in the present instance his father’s safety was
iftally concerned, and he felt he was justified in
adopting any subterfuge that would save his only

Mrs. Riley hadno idea where her husband had
gone that morning, Bob told her he was going to

take the cart and the horse and use them. The

woman offered 'no objection as she knew her hus-

band had been hired to do cartingfor the boy,'.

and so the cart, in charge of the new driver, was
soon on its way to the scene of the contract. Bob
then went over to the house of the other cartman,
whose-name was Benton, and found out where he’
kept his cart .and horse. Securing another driver
he got possession of Benton's team and put it into
immediate commission. Several hours were lost
that morning, but it resulted’ in no delay tothe
work, owing to the prompt «action of the young
contractor. ’ That evening Bob called on Riley
and demanded an explanation. T

“Why didn't you turn up this morning with
your__ cart?" he asked him. .

Riley was prof-use in his apologies, claiming I V
that he had been unexpectedly called tothe next

town on business.

' “Then wh . didn't you ‘send some one in your ’

“I had no time to hunt a man up." -

“I hope not,” replied Bob, who then left his

’ eottage and went to see Benton. '

Benton had some lame excuse to account for his
absence. Wherever he had been that day he was

, disgusted to learn, on_ his return home, that Bob
’ had appropriated his horse and cart and‘ used
, them with another driver.

He made a kick with
the man who stabled his rig, but as -Bob had-
secured an ‘order for the team» from Betiton’s
wife, his kick went for nothing. Bob was satisﬁed‘
that Benton’s excuse was pure ﬁction and de--

manded to know if‘ he intended to carry out his
' hauling agreement. 1 ~

.s‘!Of course I do,” he replied.  - ‘
“Well, if you don't show up in the morning

swinging the stick at Caldwell’s head.

Had the blow taken effect the man would prob-
ably have been stunned. ‘It missed his head and
landed on his arm and shoulder. He uttered an
exclamation» of’ pain and dashed at Will. Will
struck at him again, but Caldwell caught the stick
and tried to wrench it from him.

Will pulled him forward and the veil-becaine

It happened, however, that the two , 
men, who the reader has surmised were Bailey l "

and Caldwell, the rival contractors, after failing, ‘

to overtake the boys, came to the correct conclu-  ;.

As Bob dropped his stick,‘ .
for he couldn’t use it under the circumstances, — '

    

Vof’ the stick and Will had to draw back to avoid
-i the blow the man aimed at him. ’ ‘

‘ ‘Caldwell followed him up so closely that Will
was obliged to retreat to save himself. In the
meantime Bailey was havinga strenuous time

   

' ‘ handicapped b the bag over his head.

“Let that c ap go and give me a hand,” he
. , called to his companion.

ﬂ . At that moment Will stooped, picked up a
’ stone and sent it whizzing ‘at Caldwell. It struck

 

 the contractor on the side of the head, inﬂicting '

.  . a jagged wound, from which the blood ﬂowe

v ‘freely. The blow enraged him and he started for
.Will with anger in his eye. The boy ﬁred an-
other stone at him and ran off to a safe distance.
Caldwell shook his ‘fist at him and then returned
- . to Where his companion was holding, Bob, who

 "was quite exhausted by this ‘time.

‘ “Get hold of his legs and we’ll carry him to
the wagon,” said Bailey.

‘1‘.iVl/ait till I tie his hands together,” said Cald-
we .

He pulled a piece of cord out of’ his pocket
V _ and speedily accomplished the job. They grabbed
- ‘Bob by the feet and carried him oﬂ’ up the con-
.-necting road. Will watched their movements and
., followed them to see what their intentions were
toward his friend. He saw them putf—Bob in the
.light wagon, mount- to the seat and drive to-
,ward him in a hurry.
‘ _.‘‘I wonder ‘what they’re running off with him
for?” thought Will, crouching down in the
bushes to escape observation. “And they’re
 taking him toward the village, too. I supposed
they intended to go through his clothes and then
leave him in the road. It agipears they have
some other object in view. must follow the
wa on and see where it goes.”

gt that moment the wagon shot by and rat-
tled up the road.

and Bailey got down. Will slid under the wagon
' and crouched down. _ 
‘ “We’ll dump him into one of the em ties and
close the door on him,” Will heard Cal well say.
‘All right,” replied Bailey. ‘_‘Sho_ve him out.”

of games were indulged in, and everybody pres-
ent declaredgthey were having a bang-"up time.
At the conclusion of the dinner Bob was called’
on'for a speech, and he made one.
‘ Some’ of the "other boys, and even two of the

 

complimentary of ‘the young contractor. Bob had ..
always been well liked, but he was now voted’ ',
the most popular young man in the village, and
the smartest one, too. As the young contractor ‘
was ﬁguring on a rough stone bridge that the »
county proposed to put acre 2:. narrow strea.m_' '
now spanned by an old woo en bridge that had, -
been condemned as verging on the dangerous, ‘_
he was not sure that his supply of stone would .
hold out. ~ _ T _
So after the dinner he called Will and they slip-, .r:
ped away from the company and started off to in-
vestigate the woods to see if any more rock was :i
_ Among the Hun.-f
-dreds of trees on the farm was one giant deg
more than a hundred years old, which tower .
above its fellows, and was a kind of lan'dmark_
in that neighborhood. When Bob revisited his
property just before he began work on his chur
contract he noticed that this chap no longer hel .
itself up as straight as a die, like a.stalwai‘t,
sentinel, but wasleaning over at an ’an‘gle”_o ’
twenty odd degrees. - . ‘T A
He had remarked to Will ‘at the time that'the'_—
tree was evidently weakened at the roots and’
would fall before many weeks, probably as -SGQIM
as struck by a ‘heavy wind blowing in the di_r‘eo-‘-
tion of ‘the angle it was sagging. His, rogues-
tication prpved correct, even" without t e wind,»
for‘ it seemed as if the tree dropped over more
and more every little while. On the day of the
picnic, when the party drove upto the farm_.7«
Bob_ «noticed that thegiant landmark ‘wast 
longer in sight. As it was hanging high up 
day before'the boy concluded that it had fallen
during the night, which was the fact. « . 1. “~
“Let's go over and take a look at that fallen’
tree,” suggested Bob, when he and Will separated

 

  
   
   
  
 
  
 
 
   
 
   
  
  
  
   
   
    
   
  
  
     
  
    
   
    
   
  

themselves from the rest of the party.. ..

It was only a short walk to. the spot, and:,;
there, sure enough, lay the fallen giant prone,
on the ground, resting on several small trees its
weight had crushed to the earth. Its immense’
roots, covered with earth, pointed skyward and
at a score of other angles, leaving exposed a."=
great hole in the base of the rocky ledge against
which it had stood. Bob leaped up on to of

 

intent of getting a view of the hole it had left
in the ground and rock. ». ~ . . - ’

. The “discovery” was greeted with great laugh-
, her, and the villagers returned to spread the news.
 Leaving the boxes open for others to view
Ed comment on, Bob and Will returned to Jerry
 ’ng’s cottage. Jerry was away at work, and
Bob, under her promise of secrecy, showed the
money bags to Lucy. They carried the bags up
;to the room occupied by the boys, and counted
it. It counted up- $125,000. Bob then boxed it
‘up for transportation as he intended to take it
‘ Boston and bank it there. .
“It shall give you $10,000 of it. Will,” he said.
“And how much are you going to give me
for keeping your secret?" asked Lucy, roguishly.
— . “I’m going to give you a whack at the whole
‘of it when we are married," he replied.
 Bob didn’t bid on the stone bridge for the
. county. but went to Boston instead with Will
" and the treasure.
' .,.“Now that I have a bunch of money I'm go-
’ lug to spread myself as a contractor, Will," he
"said. “I'll hire an office on Devonshire Street
and look out for some big job. You shall be
my chief assistant, and your pay will begin, at
$10 a week."
 Bob would have been thoroughly happy now if
 hecould have found his father. His advertise-
.‘ ments in the Canadian papers had produced no
grlesullts. With plenty of money at hand he de-
cided to advertise on a_ wider plan, and consulted
;with an advertising agency as to the best method
to pursue. The manager agreed. for a certain
to make a very extensive effort to ﬁnd Mr.
_ randon, and he was able to place the hdver-
?‘tlsement at better advantage than Bob could
have done himself. Our young contractor opened
an office in one of the big buildings on Devonshire
Street, and began to look up a iob that would
‘in his estimation, be worth his while. ,

. One day he read in a certain paper taken by
‘contractors that bids would be received by the
government for the construction of a breakwater
l off ‘a certain port. Plans and speciﬁcations could
 seen and studied at the oflice of the engineer
Tfor the district of New England at Portsmouth,
*' N. H. Ten er cent. of the amount of the bid,
either in cas or byicertiﬁed check, would have
"to accompany the bid. Bob decided to have a
.- ’ look at the job, though it seemed to be one
0» beyond his ability to grapple with.
 He called at the engineer's oﬂice, read the
eciﬁcations over carefully and looked at the
p ans. Deciding that he would ﬁgure on the job,
even if he didn’t out ina bid, he applied for a
‘ copy of the speciﬁcations and got them. - Then
f he proceeded to ascertain where‘ he would get
he material called for, and the price he would
ave to pay for it. A-week later he learned
that the plant of a big contractor was about
Jo be sold by the Widow. He called at the dead
’man’s office and had a long talk with the
; manager. ' _
“' He learned that the plant contained every-
;H:1ing' suitable for the prosecution of large en-
‘ierprises like the breakwater. Then he called
on the widow and had .a talk with her. He made
such ‘a favorable impression on the ‘lady that-
‘ , consented to sell him the plant at about half
; value, for a payment of ten per cent- d

Bob determined to earn some of the bonus, and i .

he did. ’

The job was ‘completed three weeks before ‘the V‘
eight months and the government engineer noti-‘Z,

ﬁed to that effect. It was now his duty to make
a ﬁnal inspection with reference to its accep-

tance by the government. He reported that the "
work was first-class in every respect, and that, in" ’*

his opinion, the new breakwater was the ﬁnestl
in the country. ‘This fact was immediately re- f,_:
ported through all the leading dailie, and 
suddenly found himself famous as a- contra‘ctor.~

in his office one morning, when his father walked ‘
in upon ‘him most unexpectedly. Their greeting 
may be better imagined than described. Mrs

which he had come across.

He was surprised "to ﬁnd his son at the _

might now be considered worth a
million since his government success. .-

“Well, father, it is all due to that treasured!’
found on my thirty—acre farm at Malden. ,«0nly'
for that I never would have been able to have

Bucklin or Bob had been hoodooed. _, A
Bucklin was compelled to keep out of Broad

the next day Bob. reported it to Hennessey. .
“All right, Bob. I'll watch those fellows. {I

“No, sir, not a penny.” :
"‘Wel1, go over and draw an order for $160; that’
will leave you five dollars. Give it to the 
clerk and tell him to buy D. & H. shares for you.“
That will buy you 16 shares.” _ 
Bob did so, and a few days later it was reported
in the papers that D. & H. had been cornered in?
the Stock Exchange and the price began climbing
up with marvelous rapidity. . H 
Hennessey himself bought several thousand.

Finally Hennessey told, Bob to sell out. i 
He went over and ordered a sale, and saw t ‘ tr .
he had made $17 a share. Bob made a-mental
calculation and then exclaimed:

Bob was quiet, however, and kept busy at his

By this time the other bootblacks had decided

 The Fatal Bite

 It was a sad sight that I looked upon in that
little mountain cabin, on that June morning, in the
year "74; it was a sight that set my young blood
ailame, and I shut my teeth to, keep down my
emotions. ' _
A bearded young miner lay dead on the cabin
ﬂoor. He was still rolled in his blanket; the em-
bers of a late ﬁre were seen near; a bench, wash-
,gbasin.and a’ cracked mirror composed the prin-
ci al furniture of the room. It was the usual
rniner’s cabin ,to be met with throughout the gold
regions of California. _ ‘
A score of men had gathered in and about the
bin, all intent on viewing the horror—the man-
gled‘ corpse of Paul Landon——as jovial a young
miner as the mountains of the Golden State could

’ “.Who hez did this thmg'.".' _
,It was a gruff voice at my side that put the
. miestion. ' _ _
' ' 1‘:We ’haven’t discovered the «v1llain,'?- I-answered,
proceeding to make an examination of the corpse.
_A mail stood near with folded arms, pallid face
andﬁdry eyes, gazing at the face of the dead as
though fascinated. When I asked who he was,
Ga tain Turner, a mine boss, said:
,‘¥1‘hat’s Seth Shott, the.dead man’s.pard.”. Then
I I ntinued in ’a whisper: “ ’Twixt you and me,
lriefls, the man who’s guilty of this. I know it, and
I’m""going to speak to the _boys.” _ ‘
 was somewhat astonished at this moment.
’ I ptain Turner was a trusted man. one in the
employ of the Mountain Lode Co.mpany,_and it
was in the interest of this company that I was
" iting. the mines- Speculation was suspected, and
was sent up to look into the affairs of the com-
anyin general. I was to have all the time I
Igeeded and work in my own way. I hadn't been
here a week when Paul Landon was found mur-
dered in his cabin. I
'1 was somewhat new in the detective business,
but here was something that promised “pay dirt,”
" and I" resolved to follow the lead.
, turned and regarded Seth Shott ﬁxedly, after
lie _captain’s whispered suspicions.‘ Other eyes
we're_ﬁxed upon him, too, as he stood there with
folded arms gazing, down into the face of his
urdered friend.»
Was: it possible, though, that this rather hand-
me-looking young man would lend himself to
u§':h..a.¢;rime?' His countenance did not betray
' gvevil nature, if the captain's suspicionstwere

a murmur soon ﬁlled the room.
‘Lynch the murderer!" ,
Aivoice uttered the cry. and then several hands
re laid on Seth Shott, and he was dragged from
emountain cabin into the June sunshine. .
‘Boys, what does this mean?” Seth Shott ex_-

The muzzle of my cocked weapon had its ef- ’ ‘

Shott straightened to his full height and cried: .
“The gentleman from ’Frisco tells you the‘ .
truth, pards. I would sooner have’ cut out my" 
own heart than harmed a hair on the head of
Paul Landon. Heavens! how could I hurt Paul.
He and I have been chums since we left New I "
York three years ago. We were schoolboys to- _
gether, and ‘loved’ one. another like brothers. " "
Would I harm _him now? Impossible. We had
some nuggets laid by. It was for these the mur-
der was Committed I expect, but the assassins
failed to get them. . . , V;
“I was not in the cabin last night. I did not 
come in from 'Frisco until thismorning. I can
easily prove an alibi if you give me a chance." I » .; 3
‘ I again addressed the crowd, and soon the - 7
miners began to act like reasonable beings once‘:
At this point Captain Turner stepped in-,
and urged the necessity of unishing the vile?» _
assassin at once. I could see t t the captain was
anxious to see Shott hang. ‘it: '
Why this enmity?  7‘ '
I managed to get Shott aside. I was not sure 
of his innocence, but deemed it butfair to give U
the man a showfor his life. After esca ing from 
the crowd, Seth Shott grasped my liand”and7
blessed me for the interference thathad saved '-
his life. - .
“Before heaven, I am innocent!” he said,
solemnly. “I cannot remain here, however, fo'r‘:
Captain Turner would set his hounds upon me.‘If‘ '
you do not object, I will leave the mountains and
seek a place of safety for the present. In the end
I mean to‘ see poor Paul's murderer swing.’-' - 
I believed the young fellow uttered the truth
and made no attempt to detain him. In fact,.
knew that, whether innocent or guilty, he would .
surely hang if he remained in the mines, and so. "
