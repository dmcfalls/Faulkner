‘ence, the hairbrushed back, and the long pigtails have a

peculiar fascination. One actor, who played the leading

'fernale"part, receivecl a salary of three thousand " dollars a
, year, and‘ was not allowed to leave the theater during the_

run of thepiecé. His room was a cellarlike place, with a

‘small gratirig for light and air, andhere he passed his life.

Some years ’ago gambling was indulged in to an immense

' extent. Underground passages were built of solid masonry,
protected by iron doors, so that the police could not enter;

but the authorities ended all that, and before the great fire
in San Francisco you could see the iron doors lying useless

“on the ground. Still, the Chinese gamble extensively in theiiq
. peculiar method. These underground places, in Portland, ’_
' are new used as opium-dens. In one place I saw a manof

nearly eighty—ﬁve years of age, who had lived in oneof

‘, theée cellars for many years, smoking his opium and dream-
’ ing his existence away. ’

where, under the personal direction of three of the ﬁrst
lapidaries of the town, it was cut down to its present size

queenéregent, was present when the ﬁrstlfacet was cut, and
that the whole cutting of the stone occupied eighteen
