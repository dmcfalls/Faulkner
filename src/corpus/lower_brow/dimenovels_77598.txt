p",l‘hecrook_s who frequented this place andwho were

himself knew half the secrets of his own building, nor

lwas_there'_one among the crooks ‘who. knew them all;

each had his own particular knowledge ofycertain sections
of the building to depend upon it he wanted to remain
there under cover for a space of time and to use it as a

I ,_ “getaway” as well as for a hiding-place.

There was one individual, however, who Was saidto be
familiar with every secret that _the building contained.
He was a strange character.; s'hock—heade.d and bearded,
soold that his face was seamed and wrinkled,i and he
passed about with stooping shoulders, constantly mutter-

‘ ing to 'hir,nsel'f,never engagingin conversation with any ,

i’ one for a length of time, and never addressing a re—
T  mark to another person unless he were ﬁrst spoken to
. or was asked a question.

 Even at such times his answers were not always to

it , the -point and it was _generally conceded that he was only
f a half—witted pindividualwhose fund of intelligence con-

, sisted solely of his wonderful knowledge of The Cover.
 Becauseuhe was considered a crank he was called

;“Cranky,” and known by_ that name throughout the fra-

ternity since he had never given themtany other to use. 
, He had no special employment at Mulvaney’s, although

the latter always supplied him with change whenever he

to, asked him and he was given what food he r_equired_ and

 always  a place to sleep inside of, this remark-
able building.‘ Beyond that, nothing was known of him.

‘ }§;ve\n.l,Muly_aney himself, had he been duestioned, would

have replied truthfully, that he bought,Cranl<y with.,the

‘b.uil.di'ngA the same as if he had been a cat accustomed to
is living there, and he was as much a part of the structure as
' a. knot~hole in one of the boards, and about as substantial.

- ‘The, Cover was known :to.Nick- Carter only.-by whathe

3 had heard of,’ it from the police and from an infrequent
mention of it by crooks with whom he had come in con-
tactpfrom; time to time. . i  ’ v ‘ T
 £5 -But'¥w.hat~‘ the detective did not know about The Coxfe'r

 he had sotmany times run upon places of this sort, none

'1 similar in character and in use, that he was able to judge

‘-It was shortly after the conclusion of his last case as

The detective thought a long. time upon his“su’dden_lyi

3’ Sing, where he also consulted the wardens and their
 assistants. , ,
After all that was done and he had made the arrange-
-f Y ments he believed to be adequate, he held a consultation
’ with the commissioner of police in New York, and the
plan was made complete; i
The result of it all was that one morning Nick Carter,
 tin‘ a disguise which we will afterward describe, was
taken before a magistrate in the city of New York and
committed to, the Tombs. From there, by what was sup-
_ V’ posed to be a confession, he was sentenced t;oiAuburn.‘

 the. better part of a week, andthen was zﬁgain transferred
7  with like ceremony to Sing Sing, where he spent nearly
‘ two "weeks in completing. preparations for his plan. V
, V And then one of the most, phenomenal cases of escape
‘_ L from prison was recorded inthe newspapers,‘ as planned
 p and effected by alprisoner whom we will hereafter know v
as “Ruddy~Mike,” and whom we understand was Nick

.haye been effected without that" arrangement; but it was
nevertheless made to appear so natural that there - was

 Ruddy as appropriate to this supposed scar, as, indeed,
it was. The appearance of it was, of course, hideous in
the extre.me, save when a person looked at him from a

It may strike the reader as perhaps being an unfair

The tiger-ﬁghts in Javaiare thrilling affairs.,

The tiger is set down in a trap in the center of the Allen-
Allou, or great square, and is surrounded by a triple or
quadruple line of spearmen, about a hundred yards distant
from him. _. ,
Q When all is ready a Javanese advances at a very slow
pace, to the sound of soft music, and sets fire to the trap,
_at the same time opening fhe door‘ at the back part of the
cage, which, by the -way’, is too narrow for the tiger to
turn in. h ' .

As the ﬁre begins to singe his whiskers, ho gradually

begins walking toward the crowd at a slow pace, and the
slower he is, the more applause does he gain. In tho mean-
.j.,in1_‘e,, the tiger, having backed out of hisrnarrow prison, is
rather. astonished to ﬁnd himself surrounded by hundreds of
spearmen. I
‘ If he is 3 bold tiger he canters round the circle, almost
touching the spears; fi'nding- no opening, he then returns to
_ the center, ﬁxes his eye on one spot, and with "a loud roar
(lashes, straight atit. ’ ' I
_, i He is received on tho glittering spears, and, though he
 crushes many as if they were mere reeds, in half a minute
he falls dead, pierced by a score of weapons. .

In some ins.tanccsi,, howcvor, the 1_-qnrigmd charge, ca;-e‘_ mo
much for the Javanese, who. break and give VV3.y*m;tQ their
eternal disgrace. The sport then becomesldaiigerous for the
spectators.

the dried.-up bed of a stream when I.became conscious of
a shadow ‘to my left. Turning round, I beheld a lioness
about twenty-ﬁve paces off, eying me quietly. Almost simul-

lions moving forward, hal£-covered byvthe grass.

But the lioness presently turned away from me quite calmly,

On another occasion I witnessed a very interesting specta-

of some lions when I came suddenly upon an ostrich’s nest,
with some young ostriches in it only just out of their shells,
and with some eggs within a "few hours of hatching. To
my astonishment, the lions seemed to‘ have disdained the
young birds. _ . .

But on examining the tracks more carefully I learned b.Qt— '

unmistakably, had enticed them away from the. nest’ hy‘eﬁe.ct- ‘ i ll.

‘Some years; ago, in a small, town in‘ the interior of
 Pennsylvania, there lived one‘_,Cyrus T home, an old bach-
elor.‘ He had accumulatedby ‘dint of industrious labor

‘ and honestpupright dealings a fair fortune, and lived a’
 retired, contented, happy life, distributing his worldly
‘ possessions’ among those‘ who’ were poor and needy. ‘

. ‘ ’His was not "a morose nature, as most old bachelors

_ seem to possess-—his was a peaceful disposition, loving
' /' those around» him, and his sole aim was to-pmake every

one happy and contented with whom he came in contact.
In his younger days his heart had not escaped the cruel

s ‘dart, of artless, §Iupid—'——that little, cherub whose love-

A tipped’ iarrows_,_”§wiitly wound the heart had not missed

 . his aim.

T Amy Chester was the chosen one-l—-a-handsome, blue-

,disposition and industrious manner had‘ fascinated the
peart 0f.Cyrus. They had’ been bdrn within la‘ stone-

‘He was. a, cunning young rogue. .Well, it’s _,a‘c0nso1a~

" bar'to' satisfy his thirsty appetite.

‘ ‘Sharps watched himvery closely. He had known Rob-
erts a_ considerable‘ length of time, yet he had never
. known him to bean excessive drinker; he thought, per-

"sought consolation in drink—‘—a very foolish resolution,

. as liquornever eases trouble, but always ‘doubles it.

'/As he /sat there in the barroom, thinking upon the task,

hehad laid out to accomplish, and endeavoring to in-‘
‘vent some mode to assist him in his almost hopeless un-

the very button which had been lostyby the carpenter.

A’ ,' From that moment he’ made up his mind thatlthe mur-

 "He followed h‘1‘m, keeping some distance behind sodas
