So while the broker walked in and asked for’ _ 

Broker Snow, ‘Ralph was going down the ele< _
Ralph lived in a plain-looking ﬂat in
Harlem with his Uncle Jabez Coddington. The

two of them constituted the whole family. They

sent their washing to a laundry on the corner, . , s
and the wife .of the‘ janitor came up once a week ’ 
and swept the roomsout; Ralph had lived with _~
his Uncle Jabez as long as he could remember '
and his path during that time hadn’t been a bed’
of roses. C ddington was aman of sixty, though _ -
he looked oder. He had never worked within  ‘
Ralph’s remembrance, but he always seemed to H
havemoney, though no one ‘could accuse him of» _' 1 _’_
squandering it. Ralph, when he got old enough , l
to think about the matter, presumed that-his rela- ,

tive was living on his savings. Thiswas a rea-

 

source of making money. *When Ralph 'gradu—' ~ ;
ated from the public grammar school his uncle se-
cured him the position of office boy and messenvg’,
ger with Jared Snow. ' Coddington annexed his ', -,.
weekly envelope with unfailing regularity, but 
allowed him $1.50 for carefare and lunches. Out
of this ‘meager contribution and tips that came .
his way from time to time Ralph in the course . 2;
oftime saved up the sum of $50. One day’ lie~~3'
took this moneyand slapped it up as mar inal _,
security on five sha_res- of Erie stock, witha, ttle 
bank on Nassau‘ street that catered to small in-' . l
vestors. A broker had laughingly suggested to-~‘
him togbuy Erie if he wanted to make money, and T
he bought it. He had hardly made e deal when »
the stock took a boom that set the xchange by
the ears, and had all the traders guessing howf R
high it would go. Ralph did a little guessing:
himself-—he guessed Erie would go to 50..Ealph’-3‘ _
guess was a good ‘one, and he sold out at"a proﬁt '
of $15 a share. That raised his worldly wealth, '

to $125, but he was careful not to“conﬁde,the fact?

 

idea what would happen if he did.’ K . , _. « -/

A, month -later he saw 13. & 0. take an‘uxiwa1"‘dr
jump, and the recollection of his success in Erie
induced him to buy ten shares and guess ag'a;i1‘i..
His second _gu'ess‘_was just as successful as his
,n, and heicollazred a‘ proﬁt

Mr. Snow would scarcely have been surprised if

As Ralph returned to his seat by the window he
noticed that a rope and tackle were beingohaauled
to an upper floor. . ‘ - ‘ ’. i ' V

It was a mild spring day, and the lower sash
was up the full distance. .He leaned out _of"'th"e,
window and looked down’. A safe mover’s truck’
was drawn up along'side<of the curb, and as ‘theme
was no safe on the wagon, Ralph judged that
one of the safes in the building was aboutfto 
taken out. This was such a common occurrence
in the business district thattlie'~young,;messoi1gé5r
was not particularly interested in the‘pe'rfornr1-

ers was whether the boy’s grip or the man‘s Jer-

‘ safe mover down with a run that meant cer-
tain death to him. The excitement in the neigh-
-borhood grew each moment. _ If]very.window in
._ the various buildings in the vicinity was peopled
' with clerks and others gazing at the :disc1u1eting
—~ and unusual spectacle that contained all the ele-
orients of apossible tragedy. . »'
At this trying juncture one of the safe mov-
;er,'s companions above came to the rescue in a
., nervy way. He lowered himself down the tackle
 till he reached the pointoppositc his comrade,
and then clinging to the falls with both feet ,_he
- reached out and grabbed the suspended man with‘
 both arms, thus relieving Ralph of the tremen-
’ , dousstrain that had been on his arm.
 “Now throw up the window and take him in-
».‘.side,’’ he said to the messenger, as the crowd
greeted his performance with (a hearty cheer.
V It was some moments before Ralph could move
‘ifso nérveless had he become under’ the ordeal.

"raised ‘himself and pushed‘the_ sa_shes_up. The
gttashier reached him about this-time‘ and com-
pleted the job. Both then bent down and seized
the safe mover by the ‘arms, and assisted by ‘ai_i~
Vother clerk drew him in through the window in
/pa badly demoralized condition. The mob, belo_w,
. -seeing that the man" was safe; cheered again.
' By that time the street was as crowded and im-,
jaassable as though. the spectators had been down
‘there by a fire. At that moment came the clang
of a ﬁreenginerdown Wall Street. Some excited
. individual, not comprehending the real cause of‘

_of, the department was on its Way. to the scene.
,.Although everything wasrI‘1oWv’over,~ the'crowd
‘did not immediately disperse, New arrivals came
‘ ‘I1 “and wanted. to know -what the excitement was

tag ut-. A number of reserves fromithe Old Slip
.police station appeared and tackled the mob,
' which thenggot a reluctant move on. While these
things were transpiring outside, Mr. Snow’sgofﬁce
was the scene of much commotion. Itwas crowd-
ed with outsiders from the offices on the ﬂoor. All
wanted -to get a look at the plucky boy who had

man himself. '-The man soon recovered from his
scare,.and was joined by‘ his venturesome com~
pamop who had largely contributed in completw
ing his rescue.’ He shook hands [with the ex-
hausted’ Ralph and told -the boy howgratefuthe
wasito him. The other also shook Ra1ph’s hand
and;ii~said hewas a hero of the first water. , Mr.‘
Snow “and the cashier likewise contributed their
quota ﬁt commendation, but the boy was too

other spectators connected with the ofﬁce in order . -  V

to get all the facts for his story, which subse
quently appeared in an afternoon edition. When

crowd melted away, and Wall Street resumed its

‘ The safe had smashed the pavement in front
of the building, broken the iron girders beneath,
and had gone down into the ﬁi-st cellar, the ﬂoor
of which it had partially penetrated. The safe-
moving company would have a pretty bill to pay
for the damage, but that wasn't as bad as if the

"man who had been imperiled had lost his life. '

Ralph, as he~sat in his chair by the broken ' '
window, realized that he had distinguished him‘-. a
self in a sensational way, and his name was‘
bound to be in. all the newspapers. He_,w~as
he had been able to save the safe mover’s_ ife,
though in doing so he had suifered and was still 
suffering much pain and inconvenience. There.’
is always a satisfaction in the knowledge that one
has_ done his duty, especially under strenuous ' T
circumstances, and'Ralph didn’t regret the course
he had adopted, even thoughhe had come ’ oﬂ .
worst in the case. — .1 - ’ ~

Mr. Snow told him he could go‘ hom'e_f,or‘the" ‘ 9

desire to avail himself of this permission. ’- He

conscious of what was happening to his ‘pretend-‘

ed uncle, took a car and w ntuptown. M. & N. "
was up to 69, and he he $600 in cash tucked’
away in an ‘envelope in the oﬁice ‘safe, so he was
feeling -pretty good. Had he known‘ that Jabez_ .
Coddington had come downtown disguised with
the intention of following him to find out where .
he-~lodge.d he might not have “felt quite so easy; 1 
in his mind. Next morning things began tolook ,
lively around the M. & N. standard, and by eleven
o’clock the stock was booming. The usual excite-.
ment attended the rapid rise of the price, which W _ 
at two in the afternoon had gone up to 80., It — L 
was up to,86 at half—past two, and Ralph, having ,

 

Street, ordered his thirty shares sold. It was.
done inside of ten minutes and yielded him a
proﬁt of $600. On the.following day when he got " .
his "check he found he was worth a little over . ,4’
$1,500 all told. . p ‘ c. ‘
He slapped’ the money into 150 shares of_ L. Kt i
S., which had gone on a boom of its own account:
and’ after holding them ﬁor days sold out "at a
proﬁt of ‘$10 a share, which raised his working  ,
capital to $3,000. His two successes, coming one: . ~
on top of the other, added to the reward he had I “
received for returning the diamond ornamenté .

 

.-made him feel as if he was the young cock ‘lo

Wall Street. It was scarcely more than-‘two.;
weeks since that his whole cash assets amounted, I
to only $350-, which he thought a_princely sum
at the «time, and now he was worth nearly teiiwg
times that much. , « 1‘ '
“Talk about luck——I’m right in it!” he said '
gleefully. "‘Looks as if I had a winnin streak '-
of Wall Street luck on‘; I must make al I can’ ~ ‘

‘while the sun shines on my side of the_ stree .”

With this purpose in view he kept‘ his eye on,
the market, watching for another chanceto add ‘-
.to his pile. He didn't neglect his duties,’ though; a
for hewas too conscientious to do anything ¢on- '
trary to the interests ‘of his employer. ‘But when‘ ~

a person has a run of luck on, everything seeinbi j

to come his way, just as when one is up ‘against,
hard _luck everything works crooked. So it need *
occasion no surprise when we say that ,a, few <

 

‘days later Ralph found out that a syndicate  ; " -_»

time in taking his $3,000 to the little bank  ;
putting it up on 00» shares "of that stock, and

Ralph had not neglected the object uppermost “-
in his mind———to find his mother and recover the "
riches‘ that he belieyed he was rightfully entitled 
to. ‘ He spent every night along upper Broadway
on the lookout for-jth_e man who had, in his esti‘-_~

' ‘Delaney Jones got up, went to a small closet

\a stiff glass of cognac‘ and drank it oﬂ’. He re-

that it was not convenien for the boy to meet -

feeling in the matter either, as she had no idea. f
that,,Ralph was the son she had moumedas ‘

.As the detecti .e sh had employed had been,

beginning to subside, a fact that Delaney Jones 

noticed with in tense satisfaction. 
Mr. Jones, having made an appointment with, _ 
Jabez Coddington, met the rascal at the speciﬁed ,  "
rendezvous in Jersey City. Knowing that Ralph‘ ,
was to call at his (Jonesfs) residence, the arch,
conspirator suggested to Coddington that .the  V 
chance to capture the boy: when he left the house-‘. ' ‘
ought to be agood one. Coddington, from p9.st.:‘
experience, was not over sanguine of success‘, but’
Jones produced $1,000 ‘and told him to spend it 
freely in securing immediate results, so the hirer"
of the money overcame his nervous scrupl-es, and '9
he entered greedily into the project. ' He had sev-"
eral days in which to make his arrangements,’ .,
by Wednesday afternoon he ‘had prepared a plan ‘ ,
thathe thought would work. When Ralphjwent“ ‘
to call on Mr. Harding he_ was followedvby God-_‘

CHAPTER, XVI;—Conclu_sion.

The wagon crossed the river by the Ninety-’
second street ferry, which landed it in Astoria.
The driver laid a course to the suburbs of the
place, and then took the road eastward. _
 Coddington remained all the time in the wagon
ytockee his eye on the senseless boy. The wagon
; jogge on nearly all night, and as daylight began
.~to break the vehicle entered an old‘ disused lane,
and drove up to a lonesome looking farmhouse
T thathad been tenantless for some years. Cod-
dington had rented it for the summer at a small
iﬁgure, though he only intendedto make use of it
_, for a weekor two. Opening the kitchen door his
‘ '~tW'o accomplices-rbore Ralph into the house and
up tea »mouldy—looking garret, where they left
him on a bed of rags that had been prepared for
__jhis reception. The door was then locked on him
 and Coddingtorl and his companions went below.
”f1‘he men had been goneperhaps half an hour,
. hand the early rays of the morning sun were shin-
U ing through the interstices of the shutters, when
“Ralph came to hissenses. Hewas astonished at
ﬁnding himself in such strange quarters, and it,
Zwas some moments before he realized what had
he pened to him. Then he knew he-had been
_' ki aped again, and he did not doubt that Cod—'
ﬁding'ton .was"at the bottom of the matter.

 He rose from the heap. of rags and went to
one ofthe windows. A broken slat in the,__shut-
Etér enabled him toget a fair view of the sur-
roundings, and he saw that -he had beerrtaken.
tojsome place in the country. - His first impres-
qsicn was that the locality was New Jersey, ‘and
it wasn't until»-» later on that he learned he was
out on Long Island. He "tried t,h'e..windows and
found_ they had been nailed up with about an
inch of space at the" top for ventilation. There
{was not a- bit of furniture in the attic——nothing

“You only think you won’t; but you will .

“I.don’t want to talk to a rascal like you.”
“You used to like to talk to me once.” —. --

 “That wasbefore ’I knew you in your true-

The rascal grinned sardonically. - , _; _ '- .
“Are you hungry?’ he asked. . V 
“None of your business whether. I am or ,n'ot.”f
“I’m not going to starve you this time. You'll _ .

As Ralph madeno reply, and did not seemﬂto’

be in _a communicative mood, the rascal shut the”

door and went downstairs. In the course of an-.“

other hour he was back with a tough looking? ,

companion, who carried a tray of food. This 

Coddington, and his associate retired. As Ral .h
was hungry ‘he ate the breakfast repared or’
him_, since he saw ‘nothing was to e gained, 
letting it go to waste. He was left alone until '-
late in the afternoon, when his dinner was
brought to him, and Coddington told him :that’

another visit from Coddington. Thehours passed‘
away and the house remained as silent as the;
rave. * 
Ralph had »prowled over‘ the attic during the’
afternoon to see if there was any other.wa"y.of

gettingpout excé t by thedoo/r. There appeared

that no loophole was left to_ afford him a means, «
of escape. As the boy _consig_er_ed his position;
while he lay on the bed of rags 1n_’the darkness, V;
he_ grew kind of desperate at his ‘enforced ‘im-"
prisonmcnt. _ _ ~ ~. I ; — p
“This is the biggest-kind of an outrage,’-’ he ’
