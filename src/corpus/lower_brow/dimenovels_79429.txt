I grateful to Patsy for what Patsy did. After he had been
i to’ the .house_ his_ gratitude would have been forgotten in

Upon one of the many islands that dot the river, Blanco
had his headquarters, but he resided miles up the river upon
H - V anotheriisland, where, for a long time, his sister shared
with him the business cares. There he lived in all the
luxury of a semibarbaric prince. Farther up the river, on
’ another island, was his seraglio, in which were his wives,
who, after the custom of the tribes iniit/hat neighborhood,
A (had each a separate dwelling. ‘ He received with bounteous
A‘ I ‘hospitality every white man who came his way. When he
' Vﬁnally gave up the business and retired to Havana, he had

 A noted lion-tamer was sitting at the entranceo to the
vmenagerie, and the entertainment was about to begin, when’
‘he heard a piercing cry. This was followed by a furious
roaring, and cries of “Help, help!” by many voices. He
if rushed in, and this is an account of what happened:

g All eyes were turned toward one of the cages.’ It was
appalljhg. A poor ‘fellow, one’ of/the employees, had been
lifted from the ground, andlwassuspeniied outside the cage
..in the claws of four lions, one of whifh was eating his‘
arms. Onie glimpse of that h_orrib1e"sig‘ht, and the lion-
tar/ner ran, reﬂecting in -a. second that to go round by the
cages, and get, in by _the ordinary entrance would involve a
jrfatal delay, and so he‘ decided on the desperate expedient of,
arising the; grating on the side toward the spectators and‘
7 crawling intothe cage.  I

’ d mangled, he never knew; But suddenly he was on his
ectin, the midst of that savage feast, with neither stick
onwhip, and only hisiists for ‘weapons. Hestruck and
ormnanded. The lions fell back, and let fall their prey.
' /hurried out of the cage, and was ‘greeted with enthusi-
sac applause. ‘He thought the poor fellow‘ was dead; but
i was taken,tof‘,t.he hospital,‘ his wounds‘ were dressed, and
e.',;recovered:. Then he asked the. employee how it hap-
ried. ‘;»-He said:, i g ‘ H

mi CLEW GARNET.

 

A few years ago I was in command of the brig V.
Haidee, a Baltimore clipper——a long, low, black, rakingaw
craft, that looked at a ﬁrst glance more like an idealpi
pirate than the peaceful merchantman she really was./iv,
We had taken a general cargoand passengers to, Sat.-. 
vannah, Ga., and thence took in a cargo of rice and air’
new lot of passengers for Havana, Cuba. . 1::

After leaving Savannah we ran free down the Florida ,1
coast, until near Cape Canaveral, with a nice north-in _
easter to pﬁll our canvas, keeping well inside the Gulfyj,
Stream, out of its strong current, and in sight of land “
all the time. ‘ 5‘ p « ' 

lWith a full crew—-two mates and sixteen men, coolcij ’
and steward, and two cabin-boys, to which were added
twelve cabin passengers—we had, little room to spare
when all hands were on deck, for the brig was .only.
