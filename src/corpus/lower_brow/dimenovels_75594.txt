 ,, Although Teddy heard nothing more from Mr.

‘ Gorham in relation taovthe New Almaden Oil Co.

’ » wrstock, he had not forgotten the.matter.. During

' I’ I thetwo weeks that had passed since that ‘gent1e- ‘

,_ man’s visit ‘the young broker‘ had’made..m‘any
‘ . inquiries about the oil property of men who kept
track of such things, but was unable to ﬁnd out
anything suggestive of a change in the fortunes

‘K ofithe company for the better. He kept a sharp

, 0 eye on the papers that would be likely to -report
,_ -iianyinformation about the oil ﬁelds of California,

or elsewhere, but failed to glean the least bit of,

_ news on the subject that interested him greatly.
,_ ,,He had written to ‘his father to investigate the
 aﬁairs of the company for him, but could not tell
 when! he would‘ get a" reply dealing with" the
v’  matter. «, , « 

" In the meantime the price of New Almaden Oil
.went lower than ever, ’and,Teddy found on‘ talking

  

 

“ he lucky—«if.he could find any one’ who would take
lhis‘ block of shares oif his hands at 40 cents. In
the face. of his investigations he wondered why
{Gorham was so .willin‘g,,even anxious, to
p rchsae the stock for one dollar a share two
 eksback. r , . ‘ C , p
I :','Itxis quite possible that I made a mistake in
. refusing $50,000 for my "stock,”\he said to Jum-
,]s‘elf.- “It seems that $20,000 is about an it is
considered worth by‘ those well informed on the
‘subject.’ If, I had sold it for one dollar a share,
‘it seems to me I could buy it back in small quan-
, ities today at forty or ﬁfty cents. That is, pro-
vided I could ﬁnd that amount of shares onthe
market hereabouts. Well, I don’t care. The
stock didn’t cost '_me anything, so what's the ‘odds?
‘If:/fI’m out $30,000'by turning downithe offer ‘I
had, why it’s. one of the mistakes‘we‘ all make
some time or another.”  ' I -
5C.onsoling himself in ‘that philosophical way he
turned his attention to other matters. Teddy left
hisnofﬂce about four o"c1ock~ thatiday to  up-
eaiawn. ~As' he Was‘ approaching the \elevator a.
young lady stepped hllstily from an up cage and
htirried toward him. She looked .frightened and
excited, but the young broker did not ‘fail to
notice that she was uncommonly good looking.

,1’ Reaching the landing below, ‘Teddy cdntinued
j on down the stairs like Tam o’,Shanter pursued
; ; by the hobgoblins. More by good luck than any-
" thing else, he avoided missing his steps and roll-
 ing to the bottom of the ﬂight. ~ _ _ V H
'  At that late hour of the day, for it Waszlong
"fafter six o’clock, there was ‘hardly anybody in
1,,-the building, but the janitor,’ to be attracted by
 the disturbance, consequently Teddy had a clear
 path before him. .

The janitors were so busy, and none of them
being near the stairway, the racket reached ears
of only one, and very indistinct at that. J
~ ‘Teddy was familiar with the building, for’ he
, had been in it more than a hundred times when
_, ‘I acting as his father's messenger. /
-‘ _ ‘-As soon as he had secured a good start on his
' pursuers, he dhrted down a deserted corridor and
took refuge in the public washroom on that ﬂoor.
- Th‘ro'ugh the crack in the door, as he held it
-ajar, he ‘saw the bowling members of the syndi-
".C3.'t6 dash from the stairs above and take the next
night, believing their quarry was ahead still.
«' Teddy chuckled as he watched them disap-
jpear, and then going to the }wash bowl proceeded,
.‘with the ‘aid of a good lather of soap, to’: remove
‘all traces of his venerable make-up. _ , ‘ '

It“ took him twenty minutes to make himself
presentable, and then he liesurely ‘walked down
the. remaining ﬂights to the street entrance.

 

 He saw the ‘bunch of baffled pursuers standing‘

at the door» Canvassing the situation.

 To Ease them without notice ‘was not possible.
He new that Wilkins and Gorham would sure-

civly recognize him, and though he had removed all‘

 

his clothes and his presencein the buildin were
found to give him away and ‘lead to trou le.
,So, instead of going toward the door, he took

—"the stairway leadihg to the cellar, and was pres-

 

’come"on night duty. . ,
‘~Te‘ddy'‘remained in. the cellar about twenty
minutes, and then ventured up into the main en-.

either have 'to.\admit the real reason‘ for ‘h
action, or be ‘suspected ‘as’ a_ chap who, had un

interested7 Teddy. He presumed that it 'was
fastened on the inside, as indeed it was, and

possible. \ .

.1’ There was a window just \«beyond the ﬁre-
yescape, and that also interested him. None of
Tthe windows, in the house had bars, but those
connected with the second and '-third ﬂoors of
the- tower corner. That looked as if the tower.
gas a kind of prison department. Possibly Dr.
' harp occasionally took patients who were not
,in their right ‘mind ad they were kept here, if
troublesome. .In- a few minutes the driver and
yattache returned to the yard, the former wiping
"his mouth with the back of his hand. He pulled
the tarpaulin‘ off his load, let down, the dash-
board, and getting into the wagon, began passing
out the boxes and packages ﬁrst;

[. Lastly the" barrels ‘followed, then the gate was
_;opened once more and he drove out and turned
'-down ‘the lane to return to the road. The gate
.was closed,‘ locked ajid barred by the man who
belonged to the premises and then he proceeded
.tovcar,,ry the goods that had arrived into an el_l

     

  

  

storeroom. Whenhe had ﬁnished the «job in a
leisurely way, he locked the door of the place,
and "started for -the laundry, ‘where several wo-
men were at work. Adjoining the laundry was a
small engine-room, which furnished, power, elec-
ic lighting andsteam heat. ‘ '

{The "men entered the open door of this building
rid the rapidly darkening yard ‘was silent and
eserted again.‘ Teddy lighted a match /a'nd~
ooked around the Outhouse. He noted the mis-
_1lane’ous ‘and unimportant character of its con-
-tents. He also saw the‘jacket and cap of one

  
  

   

him that they might afford him a" partial dis-
;, "se.whilelhe was on the premises, so he laid’
' 1s:.own overcoat, jacket and hat in ‘a corner,

“ured out in the yard, crossed to a side door, and
ﬁnding it not locked, entered the house. A long
entry lay before him, with a staircase at the
