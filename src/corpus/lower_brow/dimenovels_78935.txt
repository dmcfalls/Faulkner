“What about his selection of friends?" V
“His friends were among those who enjoyed the same
pleasures that he does. I can say no more than that.”
“Was he popular among them?”
“Exceedingly so.” .
“Were there any of his intimate friends in this par-
ticular party?" - ‘ i

liked anything that took him

“One., The young earl of Darnley-——Jack Douglass, by
. name.”
“Where is he now?”
“In the 'City of Mexico, awaiting my arrival.” '
“He has remained there since the disappearanees ?”
“Yes.” .
“And kept up the search ?”
“Yes. He remained solely for that purpose.”
“What sort of a chap is he?”
“One whom I greatly admire.’ One in whom I have

hoped to see a future sonvin—law.”

“Ah! I See. Has his hopes coincided with yours,.sir P”

-“I believe they have. I know that he is in love with
. my daughter.”

“But she has not returned it, eh P”

“I don’t really think it evereceurred to her. She has‘
regarded Jack "as almost another ‘brother. I am quite
sure that he has never asked .her to marry him, but I am
also conﬁdent that he has always bﬁlieved she would do so
some day.” ,,

_ “Is your daughter attractive?” ~

n.

“She has the name of being among the mostgpbeautifuil.
_ young women in England.”

._ W “Is she light, like her brother?”

' “Yes. In fact, they are as nearly alike as persons of
the opposite sexes could be. Rose has a wealth of sunny
hair that has just a suggestion of gold in it, if the light
falls upon it just right. Her, complexion is perfect; her

eyes are as blue as the sea -at Naples; she is rather taller -
p than the average young woman, but as graceful as a M
fawn ; she is bright almost to brilliancy, full of laughter

and jokes, and fond of a good tirne——and in her way——
a" young woman’s way, of co_urseu.—almost as much of an

I ‘ Athlete as her brother.” A

“Indeed.” “

"‘-It has been one of Hal’s fade to teach his sister every»
thing he knew himself. He has given her fencing-lessons
until she can handle the foils andiother weapons of the
He ‘has taught her
to shoot, to ride, to sail——in short, to dovall the things

he is ‘fond of doing; That is one explanation of their
devotion to each other." - '

“I should argue from all that, that she is also of 9.

fearless disposition, sir.”

“Mr. Carter,,if Rose has a fault, it exists ‘in that very

«fact. V She is afraid of nothing. She is as fearless as a

l

 

' New NICK CARTER 

man; as self-reliant-—-and I might ;say as competent to
take care of herself. I have heard Hal say that she '
boxes so well that if she had the physical strength of a
man, she would worst him.”

“She has other accomplishments?”

“She sings beautifully, if that is what you mean. She-
is an indifferent performer on the piano. They both

speak several language's~——French, Italian, Spanish, and "

a smattering of German. There, I think I have given
you a fair idea of_ what my children have become since
you saw them, fourteen years ago, or nearly that.”

“It is all very interesting. Where are you stopping
Mr. Chittenden .7" I .. - p
“I have sent my luggage to the Holland. 1 came di-7

rectly_ here from the steamer——that is, as soonas I was
able to obtain the address. I I telephoned to police hea’d—' '
quarters for that.” — ' "

“Now, Mr. Chittenden, on general principles, there’ are '

a few other questions I should ask, although I. am al«
ready satisﬁed as to what the replies will be.” ' '
“You may ask anything that occurs to you, Mr.-
Carter.”  i , ,
‘.‘To begin, then,‘ is there anywhere in the world»an.y
man who has been a. suitor for your daughter’s hand, I

1

who has been unsuccessful, and who might, because of x.

that fact, have cherishedsome feeling of resentment to-
ward" her?” . "
“Iiam‘l not aware of such a person.” ‘ . ,
‘‘Is there anywhere, ‘do you suppose, a woman whom
your son may have wronged, more or less seriously?"
,“I cannot believe there is, sir. I have never had any I
information of the existence of such a person.” i W

“You are not aware that either -of your children has, 
- or has had an enemy ?” '

f‘No.”
“How about yourself?”
t“My.se1f?” ,
“Yes.” V , . .  1
“Oh, I suppose I’ have enemies in plenty, scattered A
over the world. A man who has lived to my age, and.
who has always been more or less closely allied to gov;

TALKS WITH OUR R READERS. ~

i At a certain café_in Paris, chieﬂy patronized by students
and by Bohemians of all kinds, situated ,_in one ot"those
small streets off the Boulevard St. Michel which seemed
to lead nowhere in particular, a gray—haired, ‘rather military-
looking man was one of the habitués. For a long time we
-wondered what brought him almost nightly to the little caféy
which, if it wore a satisfying, old-"time air appealing to one’s
artistic sense, was r|evertl1,€,lf3SS'b0th shabby and quiet.

At last one evening‘ an opportunity occurred of addressing L

 a corner of his little table bc,ca»use" of the numerous cus-
R itomers which had,co_me in, ' ’

After ‘some (lesultory conversation, in which as one of its
subjecits ﬁgured an extraordinary case of thediscovery of
the‘ double life led by a well-known inhabitant of the Boule-
_ said, somewhat suddenly: |
‘-‘There are many people who would be surprised to know

“You are not Old’ enough." he continued, after a pause,
“to remember, the case of the, Comte d’A

arming. in/fl almost every

'n1ornin‘ one of the proprietors of a gambling-deli ‘was
fatally s abbed by one of his victims, and upon being taken

had been in the habit of spending his time in the gambling-
saloon which he and another less distinguished but not more
honest individual ran in one of the buildings of the Palais
Royal. And from the proﬁts they made by the clever and

elaborate system of cheating and plucking ‘pigeons,’ he kept" by

up not only his beautiful mansion in Paris and a ﬁne stud

of horses, but also a chateau in Touraine, and report said »

was generous to many a ‘star’ of the theatrical ﬁrmament of
the time’ ‘A t

“But for this attack made by one of his ganlbling victims.
the Comte d’A—~— might have led this double life for yea_r§y
longer without discovery. Not only was his disguise excel-
lent, but he learnedeven to change his voice and his manner,

,“At least one president of the French Republic,” continued,‘ .

the speaker, “has during the last thirty years led a double
existence. And, strange to say, it was I, then in the service
of the government, who was destined to discover this fact,

which was only made known to the world by a Sordid‘

tragedy, -
“What induces people, and especially men of high social

position, to let.» these double lives it is diﬂicult to say,” re-

plied the speake in answer to a question; “sometirnes I fancy

it must be a form of mental aberration, for by no other
i means can such 8» case as that of Mademoiselle  be ex»

plained.
