as the two men entered the Exchange. In the
meantime the subject of this brief conversation
held a short confab with a well-known trader in
front of‘the Exchange, and then went up into
the visitor's gallery, which was sprinkled with
men and women sightseers taking in theantics
of the bulls and bears on the ﬂoor below. No one
would have taken him for a speculator who had
recently made a big roll out of an unexpected
rise in B. & '0. He looked rather like the son
of well-to-do parents who had dropped into the
Exchange to ‘pass a few idle moments. He had
a handsome face. his features being regular and
clean-cut. His eyes bright and expressive, and
his V-air-was alert-and business-like.
hate "attracted attention‘~most anywhere as a lad
bou to ma,l£§_,his way ahead in the world if 
accor e'd half 'a,. show. As a matter of fact, ‘Bob
Yorke was above the average in all the elements
that spell success in this world. He was born and ’
raised in Boston. His father’s§udden death com-
pelled him to get out and hustle to su port ‘his,
mother and two young sisters. A frien secured
him the job of messenger in a State Street
trader’s office, and he worked himself up to the
ﬂrm’s representative_on the Exchange,‘a position
that "called for tact, shrewdness and nerve. 

As he had all three he easily niade good. He
found many opportunities to speculate success-y
fully on the side, and thus acquired quite a large
capital for one of his age who began on nothing.

' he retirement from business of the ﬁrm for ‘
which he worked gave him the chance he had long
dreamed of——to leave Boston for New York.

There’ is only one Wall Street, and that was the . 

Mecca. of his ambition. So he packed his grip-
and came on. After looking the ﬁeld; over‘ for a
week he hired a small but handsomely appointed
flat in Harlem and sent for his mother and sis-
ters, whom he installed in their new home, which

they liked, very much indeed. Then he rented’ “ V V

s 2 FIGHTING THE
market. _Both the*bulls ‘who had lost, and the
bears who had won, were anxious to find out who
had caused the slump.

When the matter was traced , to the young
stranger from Boston he became for several days
the most-talked—of person in Wall Street, and one
daily newspaper printed a column about him,
after its reporter had interviwed him at his office.
Bob remained an hour in the Exchange gallery
and then took a ‘stroll around among the Curb
brokers to see what was doing in that direction.

After that he went to lunch and returned to
his oﬂice. A little red-headed office boy ‘was hold~
ing a chair down outside the railing that divided
off Bob’s desk from the rest of the room.

“Anybody been in to see me, Dan?" asked Bob.

“No, sor; niver a sowl,” replied the boy with
a strong Irish accent. -4

Dan O'Hara was the son of the woman who did

' ’ the washing and sweeping for Bob’s mother,‘ and
the young‘ speculator had hired him to look after
his office and carry an occasional message for
him. Mrs. O'Hara was mighty proud of her son
employed in Wall Street, and told all her neigh-
bers that Dan was working for a rich broker: In
consequence Dan ‘was greatly envied by the other
boys of the neighborhood, who believed he must
be getting a princely salary.

Dan was naturally a close-mouthed boy, and he

[ wouldn’t let anybody know whathis wages were.

‘ " /Bob had bought him a neat and substantial suit

' of store cloth, to which Dan added a gold-washed
‘ watch-chain with a big key to’ hold one end in his

vest pocket. When Bob saw the chain he bought

Dan 9. dollar watch which kept accurate time, and

after that the Irish lad held his head pretty high
wamon his associates. The style that I)an blos-

some out in involved him in several scraps with
be s jealous of -his good luck; but as young

O’§ar_a was tough and handy with his ﬁsts, he

came out ﬁrst best from all of his encounters,

and consequently established himself as cock

'  .of the walk in hisown neighborhood.

_Bob sat down at his desk and began to read one
of the'Wall Street dailies that had been delivered
at the oﬁlce while he was out. The young broker
had ‘seen it re orted in the papers that he had
cleaned up $1 0,000 on his B. & \0. deal. For
once the press had got the facts down correct,

_ still very few traders believed it just the same.
They had had long experience with the careless

way in which the average reporter, in his hustle

after news, handles the truth. There were some
brokers who were not so» skeptical concerning
~ Bob's reported winnings, and several of. these

. gentlemen were beginning to la pipes _in the

V  young speculator’s direction wit _the view__of
testing, his sharpness‘ and, if possible, annexing

a part of his capital.

~ Among those whohad an eye on Bob's _stock of

ﬂeece was William Norris. He _had _Just re-

‘me that tip,” thought Bob. “I didn't know that
NewlYorklbrokers~ were so liberally disposed as
my caller seems to be. I wonder if that is a real
1iointer,'or whether Mr. Norris has an axe to

plenty of time at his disposal, he didn't make any
kick. He called ‘on Mr. Fogg, who was one of the
guns of the Street. He was admitted to the pri-
vate ofﬁce after sending in his card. , V
“What can I do for you, young man?" asked
Fogg in a pompous tone and manner.

the interest appears to be due and unpaid, owing
to the fact that they were mislaid for sixteen’ ‘

to see what you think they're worth now.” 4,
“Worth!” exclaimed Mr. Fogg after looking at
them. “You might frame them and then they'd be
worth the frame, anyhow.” ’ ’ -
“‘How is that?” asked Bob, greatly taken aback.,j_
“How is it?” answered the broker. “These cer— »
tiﬁcates are nogood.” “ '
“No good!” *
“No. Except as waste paper. As you see, they
are dated April 6, 1888. When the road went to

said tr-at it was nothing more than e expected.

“You’d better frame one of those certiﬁcates as
an object lesson,” he said, “for I don’t believe the
old lady in black will return for her money.”

The broker proved a true prophet—the old-lady ‘~ A
did not come back. ' ‘

The game sprung on the little speculator was '
considered _a failure when the old lady reported’ x
that the boywould not advance $10,000 or buy « -
the stock offhand. V , -’  '

As the certiﬁcates would not stand investiga-
tion the originator of the plot did not care to I 3
take any more chances, and it was just as well for ‘s...
him that he didn't, for the indignant Bob might 
have made it hot for him through his emissary.‘ _

It was about this time that Bob saw a chance ._ —. 
to get in on the market again. . ' , . _7
‘For weeks the ﬁnancial papers had been prints’ ~. .-

Kings. The insiders hastened to intrench them-
selves behind their ‘hold on the company.. They
' found, however, that many of their former sup-
porters. had deserted them for the opposition. The
result was that a battle royal was soon being
waged by the rival factions to get and hold a ma-.
jority of the stock. '
Thousands of shares had been sold to the pub-
lic and all these were now being eagerly sought
after. Bob saw his chance and jumped right in.

‘ Th-e price was advancing every day. He left an.

order with Broker Daly to secure him any part
of 10,000 shares at the current ﬁgures on margin,
and‘ it took the ﬁrm several days to ﬁll the order.
' The stock was now growingscarce, for alm'ost all
the brokers were buying it, and holding it for the
high price they saw in the future. Bob’s shares’
cost him various prices, the average being 80. -
In a week the price was at par, and three days
afterward 110 was offered and refused for the
-‘stock. At the end of two weeks all Wall Street
was crazy as sales were made at 130 in the Ex-
‘ change. D. & G. had never in all its history
fetched such money, and the end was not yet.
' Brokers who had intended’ to sell at par were now
’ ‘refusing _131. ‘ Nothing was talked about day
' after day but the furore over D.,& G. The elec-
tion was approaching and more strenuous exer-
tions than ever were being put forth by both sides
’ to get_ the stock. Millions were drawn upon with
the idea that it would all come back eventually in
one shape or ‘another. Bob concluded that this
u 0 sort of thing couldn’t keep up much longer. Only
.the craze for fabulous proﬁts that held the Street
in its grasp kept the price up as it was. So one
afternoon Bob put an advertisement in the “Daily
Argus” that he was open to offers for 1,000 shares
- of» D. & G. p
‘ 3 Next morning his oﬂice was crowded with brok-
ers by nine'o’clock. He was down early and re-
ceived them one by one behind the railing. To
. the‘ﬁI‘Sl} broker/who interviewed him he sold 300
— shares at 135, giving him an order C. O. D._on
Broker Daly for thestock. Hevkept on selling
~ small quantities from 100 shares up at 135_ until
he had exhausted 5,000 shares, no one seeming to
‘notice that he had sold more than his advertise-
ment called for. , ‘
y - Finally a representative of. the party in control
reached his desk. ,
(‘Hpw many shares have you left?” asked the
gléntfleman. , y c
-'‘'‘How many do you want?” asked Bob.
“All I can get.”
‘ “What are you willing to give for any part of

“Why, you advertised 1,000 for sale, and you

He had made the enormous proﬁt of $55 a share 7‘-
on the deal, something that only happens under” 
such exceptional circumstances as that involved ‘
in the D. & G._ﬁg'ht. T
A week later the annual meeting
was held and the insiders won out. , ,
Their victory cost them millions of dollar\s,‘_butA

It is doubtful ifanyone did much betterya-s’

from $140,000 to $690,000. And nobody but"_t_he‘
ﬁrm of Daly Sc Co. knew that he had. beeniﬁjs

CHAPTER V.-——Which. Introduces Kittie Clover. >

On the whole Norris was very well satisﬁed
with his option deal. He thought that there was
nothing to prevent him from going. into the mar-
ket and buying 5,000 shares. of L. & M. at 68, with
the certainty of making $4 a share proﬁt on it,

providing Bob found it proﬁtable to call and pay .

for the stock. If. on the contrary, the little specu-
lator found it more advantageous to sacriﬁce, his’
deposit by default, the broker would still make
the comfortable little sum of $17,000. Of course
5.000 shares would cost him $340,000, and that
amount of money would be tied up for ﬁfteen
days, which would cost him something in the way
of interest, for he would be obliged to hypothecate
the shares for 66 per cent. of their current value. ~
There was another way by which he could get
around it and save some of the interest. That
was to wait and see whether the stock was going

‘to rise before buying it. That was a‘ risky way, »

and not usuallv followed by dealers in options.
William Norris was a broker who often took long

. chances to make an enhanced proﬁt, and as. luck ,
seemed to follow him he generally came out at ’_ ' *
In the present case L. 8; '0

the head of the game.
M. had been slowly falling for ten days, and in

his opinion it was likely to go lower before it be— .:

gan to rise again. He ﬁgured that in a couple of
days he would be able to buy the 5,000 shares for
65, or 66. That would mean an extra proﬁt of
$10,000 or $15,000 in his pocket. -

The slump in the price had been brought about
by the syndicate that intended booming the stock,
for the purpose of buying it in as low. as possible.
Mr. Norris did not go to the Exchange and buy

_the 5,000 shares that afternoon, so he remained

in ignorance of the fact of its scarcity. Next day
L. & M. went down to 67 3-4, and Broker Norris
smiled grimly when he saw the quotation on the
tape. The slight decline did not worry Bobat all,
for it was not unexpected by him. That after-

noon .he was walking down the corridor toward 
’ his oﬁice when he saw a girl of perhaps seventeen  .>

come out of one of the nearby offices. She looked
so pale and delicate that Bob glanced‘ at her-with

totter and throw up her hands. He sprang to her.
assistance and was just in time to catch her in his
arms as she uttered a sigh and fainted dead

away. 9 ' V =

“My .gracious!” he ejaculated. “I wonder
what’s the matter with her?”

He felt that it was up to him to do something»

for her, so he carried her into» his oﬁice and laid 

her on the lounge. He sent Dan to the nearest
cafe for a glass of brandy, and while his boy was
gone he proceeded to bathe the girl's’face and
chafe her hands and temples.
returnedwith the cognac the girl was reviving.‘

.‘ and she came entirely toherself after Bob had. 

poured a part of the’ liquor down her throat. She,

was‘ ‘a very pretty young lady, and Bob took an
immediate interest in her. k
’ belonged to»/a good family, and possessed a win‘—_

some and intelligent" countenance. As soon at:
consciousness returned to ‘her she started u and‘.

By theytime, Dan ‘V 7

pened to her. Bob told her that he had caught
her as she was falling to the ﬂoor of the corridor
outside in a faint. Then he had brought her into
his ‘office and did his best to revive her.
“I am very much obliged to you, and very sorry
I have caused you so much trouble,” she said in
' a sweet tone, while she looked athim gratefully.
“Don’t mention it. miss. The trouble was noth-
ing. I am very glad I was at hand to be of ser-
vice to you when you_needed it. Don’t be in a
hurry to go. You may rest yourself until you

welcome to remain here as long as you wish.”
“Thank you," she replied. “You are very kind.

“You do not look strong.” replied B_pb. “In

replies. ‘I came down today to see the people.

As the girl concluded her eyes ﬁlled with tears‘

her.’ 1 If he had had work for her to do he would
'have'«hired her himself. As he talked with her
an idea struck hmi. I . . , I . i I

Yorke.” he said. ‘ ' ’ .
‘ , . “I’m in-business to -make all I can,” replied the
little speculator. ' ’ .
The stock went for 97. Bob’s combined proﬁt
after all- expenses had been paid amounted, to
$720,000. That made him worth $1,410,000 in
 cash. a pretty tidy sum for a boy operator who
 had come from Beantown a few weeks before
‘ with $40,000 in his pocket. ‘ -

CHAPTER VII.—-Plotting to Do the Little
Speculator Up. ’

L. & M. went nearly to par before the syndi-
cate succeeded in unloading its holdings, and
when the support of the combination was en-

‘: tirelv withdrawn from the stock it began to drop.
It went down slowly without any panic setting
in, but as usual a good many small speculators
lost money. These werethe foolish ones who had
bought at top prices, and there seems to be lenty
A of enthusiastics doing that during every oom.
.: Bob was now a real millionaire, and ‘well on the
road toward his second million.’ Mr. Daly, the
broker who did the boy’s business, was the only
man in Wall Street who hadd line on Bob’s
ﬁnancial standingyand of course he wasn’t saying
anything about it.’ While Bob was working his
— L. & M. deal he was also doing what he could to
‘ . help Kittie Clover at customers. He succeeded
i so well that the g 1 now had all thework she
, could do between nine o’clock and four, which

_ were her office hours. .
 Sometimes Bob remained at the oﬁice till she
‘was ready to go home, and then he escorted her
. to the Hanoversquare elevated station. .He soon
learned that she had\a younger brother who went
. toschool and their mother was living in a small

‘inexpensive ﬂat in Harlem. That they had seen
« much better days when her father was alive. He

had been a merchant in the hide and leather dis-

trict.“ but at his death his affairs were found so
, involved that they got nothing out of his estate.

All ‘Mrs. Clover receivedwas a $2,000 life insur-

ance, and most of that was gone now. As time

‘v’

passed Bob and Kittie grew. very friendly, and,

»‘ ﬁnally’ he began calling on her once a week at her

~ home of an evening. One evening he invited her

. and hermother to go to the theatre with him, his
“ . mother andhis two sisters. ‘

, a They accepted, and thus the two families be-

~— came acquainted. Mrs, Yorke was quite attract-

 ed to Kittie’s mother, and-Kittie herself took a

. ;-great fancy’ to Bob’s sisters, as they did to her”
Thus a warm friendship sprang up between all i

‘”'~¢on,cerned. Bob was pleased at this, for he had
‘ taker: a strong fancy to the girl, and wanted his

— r family to like her as well as he did himself. Al- 0

‘ , though Bob did not dream of_ the fact, there was

gtrouble gathering on his horizon. William N_or-
 ris had lost nearly $75,000 through that option

, deal, and he was’ awfully sore on the boy.‘ In the
_ 1 eyes of the‘world ‘Norrisiwas an eminently’ re-
U sspectable man, andihe conducted himself, out-

 wardly, at least, to’ warrant that estimate. But
_uiidertl_ie polished veneer of respectability there
 slinnber-’ed passions that were dangerous to him-
, self as will as others. He was vindictive for one

If anybody wronged him he made it a 'point.to,
get back at him. As an instance of this it was
known to a select few‘ that he had brought about ‘
the ruin of a humble carpenter who had done him ,7
out of a sum of money by leaving a ﬂat 'owned"'by“
l\/Ia‘. Norris without paying a month’s' rent, and
the broker never rested till‘ he got square with
him. The means he took to effect his purpose:
were not Christian-like, but Mr. Norris was~,oi'd, _
a Christian on Sunday and when attendingvestryf
meetings of his church, or donating liberal Sums’
to the moral welfare of the heathen in foreign?
lands. Therefore, when Mr. Norris ﬁgured up‘
his loss in theoption deal his rageand chagrin’
were so great that he vowed to get square with
the (liittle speculator. and he intended to keep his,
wor . i . V e 

‘Beaver was a kind of kindred spirit to Norris‘
Much younger in years, he lived the life «of a mi ‘
about town, for marriage never had had attraac
tions enough for him to win him over to the belie
, He lived in fashionable bachelor apart-*
ments somewhere uptown, belonged’ to the same,
clubs of which Norris was a member,» as Well,as7l
a few additional ones. He was popular among”
his friends, and spénthis money freely. He also
lost considerable sums at gambling joints, »but;a
he was successful in Wall Street his losses didn’t~
both-er him much. . V  :g

Beaver’s morals were neither better nor worse l
than the majority of those with whom he asso-
ciated———which isn’t'saying't_hat ’he_,was a p‘ara'go
of virtue by long odds. Underthe Spur of term
tation he could easily havebeen worse. ” o L, 3

Norris knew Beaver like agbook, and having.
much stronger will power he had considerable in '
ﬂuence over the younger man. i As soon as th
broker began to figure on gettin, fback at Bob
Yorke he took Beaver into his con dence. ‘j ‘

“That boy has made a wad of money out'o:E,.5th
._‘l wouldn’t be surprised if-4h’,

. “As much as that?’? ejaculated the otheribroker
in surprise. “How do you know?" . ; >’~

“Well, I know he did me up to the tune’ of $15,

The little speculator got the money from -his

to attend a directors’ meeting’ of a certain in us-

before he expected to be able to get away. Under
the circumstances he asked Bob to wait for him,
as he wanted to use the money he had arranged’

let go of him and grabbed the girl.

office, holdin her till he believed she had fainted.
Then he shu the door, rejoined Norris, who was
holding the now unconscious Bob, and helped him
carry the boy to the elevator.
jWlien“ the cage on its way down empty stopped
at the ﬂoor, the elevator man looked-surprised at
seeing Yorke, who he knew well, in that condition.
Norris hastily explained that he was a physician
who had been called to attend the little speculator.
‘ “He’s suifering from an attack of organic heart‘
trouble, and I must get him to my office as soon
as possible. His heart has completely collapsed.”
. The elevator man, believing him to be a doctor,
was willing to take his word.

On reaching the main corridor Norris‘ quickly
”..,carried the limp form of the boy to the sidewalk

rushed down with the excited Kittie in it. "She

The girl, ﬂeet as adeer, outstrippedthe man.
“Help! Help!” screamed Kittie, rushing forward
. and striking at Norris with her parasol.

Beaver, who was holding the door of the cab
open, . seized Kittie and swung her spinning
against the elevator man who was following at
her“ heels. . ' '

The man caught the girl and saved her from a

' fall, and then made a spring at Beaver. ‘
‘~ The broker was an athlete and clever boxer. «
_ Quick as a ﬂash he planted a heavy blow in the
man's face and sent him dazed to the ground.

_As Kittie ran to the cab door and screamed to
‘attract attention, Beaver sprang up beside the

Some hours afterward Bob Yorke recoveredghis

The first thing he was conscious of was;a.ba.d

He seemed bewildered by the strangeness of
surroundings, and could not understand whathad
happened to him.‘ ~ ‘ -_ ’ _j_‘:
_ Gradually, as the torpid feeling wore oil’, he lig-

As; he couldn’t answer the question himself it
remained unanswered.

“How the deuce could I hath been brought away
from my Wall Street oiﬁce in an unconscious con-
dition and nobody notice that something crooked

That seemed to be something of a mystery to
.-Bob, especially as he remembered that Kittie was
in his office at the time. , V

 ’He"paced up and down the room thinking mat-
ters. over. V . -
 The more he considered his predicament the
more disatisﬁed and disgusted he became over it.
 Bob looked at the Windows meditatively.
 It would be an easy matter to smash glass,‘ sash

the room. _ ‘ _

The night was dark, with neither moon nor

trees on either of the roadway. A
I “Well, I’m free, and I’ll bet those rascals, who-

The only. thing that bothered him was that he
had left his hat at the house, but as he felt a
small roll of bills intact in hisvest pocket he

guessed he would be able to buy a new hat in the

~ When Bob reached his home he found his
mother and si_ster in great distress.

Kitty and her mother had been over, and 'the

girl had told what took place at the office, and how

.. Bob had been carried off in an unconscious state

 in a cab by two men. She explained how she had

" , done all she could to save Bob, but that one of the

. men had nearly strangled her in the office, and

subsequently had almost thrown her down when

- A she reached the sidewalk in pursuit of the kid-

napers. _ _ p

The late editions of the evening papers had the

j story, one alluding to it as the “Mysterious Kid-
‘ , naping of Wall, Street’s Little S.peculator.” '

The case was already in the hands ofthe head- A

quartérs'detectiv,es, and reporters of morning pa-

" . ,pers had called at the flat to’ see if they could

 learn anything from Boh’s mother. When Bob

rushed inon his family about ten o’clock he was

received with the greatest demonstrations of joy.

It took him half an hour to satisfy their anxious

, inquiries. He did not tell them that he knew the

 - identity of the men responsible for his abduction.

He’ was not in a position tojrove his knowledge.

 “Well, now, folks,” he'said when he had ﬁn-

' ished his story, “I haven’t had a thing to eat

 since I ate’ my lunch at one o'clock. Got a cold

bite in the larder?” . _ V

hard to tell what they will do.” . .

Norris and Beaver, both walked away looking
much relieved. , V

Next morning Bob started to look into the trac-
‘ftion ‘company deal that Norris, Beaver and their
friends were interested in. He found out that the
roadfwas known as the White Plains 5: Barkeley
Trolley Company. It was ﬁfteen miles long and
was barely meeting its ﬁxed charges, after pay-
ing its operating expenses. \ .

‘The Westchester.Traction Company had made

ly because the widow of the ex-president objected

‘All that Bob could learn of the lady was that
her. ‘name was Mrs. Martha Williams, and that
flier home -was at White Plaints. ‘The little ‘specu-

out the hint to see how thelawyer would take it.
Mr. Ball looked a bit startled. ~ Not being a Wall

gency, and believedthat the drop in price was

solely due to the poor ﬁnancial showing the road ’ '

“Have you heard anything to that effect?” he

‘ asked.

“I must decline to say whether I have or not. I
stand willing to pay $600,000 in cash for Mrs.

But I must have an immediate answer, yes or no."

“It would be impossible for me to sell that stock

a chance of the lady selling at 22.”

“I will hardly be ableto get a reply to you_‘

before the morning,” replied, Mr. Ball.

“Send it, anyway," answered Bob,’ rising to go. V

‘» Mr. Norris’ went on the ﬂoor of the Exchange and
began bidding up the price of White’ Plains &

0 CHAPTER XI.-—The Bursting of Qndom.

Bob soon saw that the traction shares were_

, advancing in price.

“I, guess the boom is on at last,” he thought.
He put on his hat and went over the the gal-

’ lerv of the Exchange where he stayed until one

o’clock, by which time W. P. & B. traction had

_  ~ gone back to 30, and was attracting the atten-
_ ; tion of the brokers.

“‘ ell, I’m $30,000 ahead at this point,” said

«N ‘Bob to himself as he went to- lunch.

He did not return to the Exchange, but»_’kept,
an eye on the ticker in his oﬂice. It closed that

day at 35. The stock that Bob had purchased 6

was in six certiﬁcates of 5,000 shares each, and

next morning he put them in his pocket and called
on his brokers, paly & Co. ’

.“Mr. Daly,” he said, “I have here 30,000 shares
of~W. P. & B. traction. I want you to go-upon

‘the floor of the Exchange and unload them in,

blocks of 5,000." B V 0. ).
Then he explained the situation to the broker.
“The Norris crowd will hardly be able to take

/Ti/n..al1‘,this stock,” he said. “Offer the stock to

Norris, one certiﬁcate at a time. If he should re-

“ ; fuse to take any of it dump it on the market and
 break the price.

” I'm going to spoilthat boom at
any cost.  ’

The broker ut on his hat and went over to the

i,\Exchange whi e Bob mountedto the; gallery to

FIGHTING‘ THE‘

As no more stock was offered Norris, the three
members. of the syndicate began to unload with
great caution. V

 They, had sold 2,000 shares when Daly’s repre-
sentative appeared with the. last block of 5,000,
which he oifered to Norris at,,40.
That was the ﬁnal straw and the broker threw
. up his hands in despair, ’
i ‘ Then Daly’s man threw it on the market in a
bunch and it immediately precipitated a slump.
Inside of ten minutes W. P. & B. traction was
down to 30 and still falling.
, Norris, white as a sheet, and followed by Beaver
and their other associate, hurried out of the Ex-
change.
They knew that they were ractically ruined.
Bob, who had witnessed t eir overthrow from
’- ' the gallery with supreme satisfaction, followed
them andmet them on the sidewalk.
“How are things, gentlemen?” he asked them
‘ with a grin. “I’ve just made about $300,000 out
. of W. P. & B.- traction. I unloaded through my
broker 30,000 shares before the slump, the last
‘ 5,000 on the market, and I don’t know how I stand
on that.”
‘ “You’re a liar!” roared Norris. “That was Mrs.
' Williams’ stock.”
pl ' “It was until yesterday, but I bought it at 22,
and got 38,from somebody for ﬁve-sixths of it. It
's was the last 5,000 that broke the camel’s back. I
guess somebody is out of money.’.’ i _ ,
The three brokers glaredﬁercely at the little
. speculator. . V ' _
His triumphant and satisﬁed look conﬁrmed lus
statement‘and maddened Norris. ‘ ' ’
With a howl like that of a wild beast he sprang
at the boy, caughthim by the throat and bore him
. to the ground.

, CHAPTER XII.-—After the Slump.

. Broad Street was crowded with brokers. mes-
_ senger boys, and other. pedestrians at the time’
"and Broker Norris’ 'Vlcl011S attack on Bob could
~ not fail to’; attract instant attention and cause
considerable excitement. The head..of the bursted
syndicate was nearly crazy over his personal
.]ogs‘es, and when the boy let out the truth-—that‘
‘it’ was he‘ who had*dumped all those shares of
I. W, P. 8: B. on the syndicate—he lost his head and
attacked him as we» have seen. Beaver and his
" associate jumped forward to separate Norris
from " the young speculator, but the frenzied,
: tradervhad such a grip on the boy’s throat that it
was as much as they could "do to get the.pair
apart. Bob was nearly black in the face. from
« the choking he had received,.and he fell half un-V
fconscious to the sidewalk. ‘
p v. ~ As a crowd began to collect, Beaver, seeing how
fserious matters looked for his friend Norris,
‘called. on the trader to help him carry Bob
hitoa neighboring cafe. ‘Part of the crowd fol-
'lowed them, but gradually dispersed‘ after the
uwingingidoor of ‘the car closed behind the prin- .
éipals in the trouble. Beaver asked the bar-
lheperifor a part of !a glass of. good brandyfand
he poured this down Bob’s throat, reviving the
hey at once. I _ *

‘ j 1 That closed the interview and Bob left the cafe
and called on Mr. Daly. He found that Daly had
véold the last 5,000 shares in 1,000 sections at an
average price of 28. Altogether Bobfs proﬁts
" amounted to $400,000 on~the 30,000 shares. He
ftold his broker about the oﬂ'er Beaver had _made
"on behalf of the bursted syndicate, and said he
. had decided to give the_ Norris crowd a chance to
crawl out of their hole if they could do so.

"¥I’m not doing this on account of _any sympathy

he was curious to learn how the members of the“ ,
late syndicate were likely to come out of their
hobble. He wondered if the Westchester Traction
Company had taken a hand in keeping the price‘
of the independent road down. The’ impression
prevailed in Wall Street that the big company
expected to gobble up the small road at its. own,_‘ ‘ 
price. .Bob believed that, too, and ‘he guessed the‘ = 
Westchester Company would win out,’ for it was ..
gontrolled by some of the money-kings of Wall,

was taken into custody as he was leaving his]

at his apartments. .. V   

Both were taken to the Tombs. Theyziwere 
paralyzed‘ when they understood why»they,h9;d —,

._ FIGHTING, ran

" terest in the fate of the W. P. & B. trolley line,
~ which seemed destined to fall into the hands of
» the W_estchester Traction Company. '
He called on the president of the road and had
_a long talk with him. Then a directors’ meeting
was called to consider what could be done to save
; . , the, i_ndependent line. Bob was present at the
meeting and listened to all the plans proposed. A
hundred thousand shares of the stock had origi-
nally been issued at 40. the par value being 50.
All this and another million had been usedup in
building and equipping the line for business.
Mrs. Williams had stuck by the road with her
, 30,000 shares, and that gave the insiders a clear
control of the company. When Bob bought her
’ ‘shares and unloaded them on the Norris crowd
the people in control of the road became in the
; minority, and the Westchtster Company, by buy-
ing up the stock onthe market, could have taken
thingslin their own hands. . - . ‘
Q The magnates at the head‘ of that company
i were. in no hurry to buy the stock for 24, or even
when it dropped to 20, as they foresaw that it
would probably go to 15, for nobody but the in-
V siders seemed to want it, and they could not af-
fford to buy it in. As soon as it got to that point
they had brokers ready to step in and gobble it
up. These brokers were also Watching to see that
‘no concerted move was made by anyone else to
,bu_v'it. Bob, however, having made up his mind
‘ torhelp save the road. if he could, played a march
‘ on them. Through a well-known brokerage house
he-,.bought the 30,000 shares held by the Norris
crowd at 19: Then he made a quiet canvass of
, the, Street and secured 20,000 more at around the
same price. He had the original 100 shares h_e
.- had ‘bought when he started to do up, the syndi-
cate, which gave him the individual control of
‘the road.’ not counting the 35,000 ‘shares held by

7 But they did not give up the idea of securing the
, independent road for all that. They commence
"an attack on the’ stock in the market and drove it
: down to 15.. They did this by causing the publica-
Ftion of rumors against the road in the Wall Street
papers, and also in the daily press. Bob, who was

CHAPTER XIV.—Bob Puts Through Another-I I
‘ ‘ Winning Deal.‘ . 9

Of course the fact became known all thro glt :
the ﬁnancial district that Bob Yorke, the little -. "
speculator, as he was facetiously called by ma,ny.::
traders. was now in control of the White Plains’
& Berkeley Trolley; Company. The Street won-gt
dered who ,was at his back, for nobody believed he

stock for himself. The brokers also knew that he,’
or the man whom they believed was ﬁnancing him, «;
had a big  on his hands against thermoney

.’ “Sure they will,” laughed the man he was talk-

ing to. p - -

“Still it is reported around today that he sent

their representative away the other day with a
, ﬂea in his ear.” ’

c ‘ “So I heard; but what can he do against the
opposition? They’ve got the stock down to 14,
and can forceit to nothing if they choose.” _

-I “That won't do any good if the insiders can

manage to hold on.” ' f

. “What's the good of their ‘holding on? They

are not making .a cent on their invested capital,
, _ and it takes a whole lot of scratching to pay the
'1 _ expenses and charges.‘ Should the_road run be-

hind so that they can't meet the interest on the
first mortgage bonds the bondholders will at once
,. throw the -road into a receiver’s hands. As the
Westchester-money kings have bouglit up the
bonds they'll have no mercy the moment they ﬁnd
a legal excuse to get their hooks in.”

Wall Street didn’t expect the ﬁght that Bob

‘ was making to hold the road on an independent

' basis would last long. or amount to much; but

then Wall Street didn’t know Bob as well as it
thought it did. The money kings opposed to Bob
did not intend to be outwitted by a mere boy._ In

‘ fact, they laughed long and loud at the bare idea

"of getting a set-back from a youth of his years,

Iidi-getting that he had really drawn ﬁrst blood

in the ﬁght when he managed to capture the 50,-
000 shares that they might have had themselves

_stea_d,of reaching up and plucking it. The ﬁrst
round. therefore, had ended in Bob’s favor, the

second one was now on. The only thing the
. Westchester magnates could do was to bide their
time. They found that the beating down of the
A stock was not likely to produce any results. as it
was all held by themselves and Bob and his crowd
‘ ~—-—and_ both intended to hold on to it. They'ﬁg-

uréd that having acquired the majority of the
road’s bonds they were in the position to jump on
4 ,-the independent line the moment. it defaultedin
. f\the‘interest payments. - .
J , ; ‘ Bob knew that fact well, and he did not intend

' '_ that the road hould default as long as he and his
. . g ‘ associateshad the money to make good any differ-
- ‘ ence lacking. The little speculator had been so

. much occupied with the fortunes of the trolley

; line in which he was identiﬁed to the extent of

» nearly a million that he hadn't given his atten-
' tion to any private deal for many weeks. He
 still had nearly $900,000 stowedaway in his safe
. deposit box doing nothing. Several times he
‘ f thought of advertising the fact that he had money

» to loan on gilt-edged security,'but he did not.

- . Shortly after the interview he had with the rep-

resentative‘ of the Westchester Traction_ money
I kings he discovered that a clique of moneyed men
had formed themselves into a syndicate for the
purpose of cornering and booming H. &, .
‘shares. As soon as he was sure of his ground
jtlie little speculator called on Mr. Daly, his

broker, and told him to buy any part of 30,000

the last of the shares at an average price of 80.
and then notiﬁed Bob that he held them subject
to his order. In a day or sothe price jumped to .
82. By that time- the syndicate had ca turedj, 
about all the stock on the market except t e“ 30,- I
000 held by Bob-_ At a meeting “of the members
of the pool the said shares formed the main topic '-
of consideration. They wondered who was hold-_ . ,;;
ing them, and how they could get them. ‘ r  *
‘‘'._[‘hey may be held by some trust coinpanyas . _

case they won't come out to‘ bother us.” , V V '
_“But suppose they are in poossession of some
big speculator—-‘what then?” asked the gentleman '
who was managing the deal. “They’ll be thrown
at us about/the time we're getting ready to ,un-: ,1 .7’

hold the price.” - ‘f 3 ‘ ~
“We’d-better start a bear movement against 
H. & O. and try to frighten the person who holds.
them into selling,” suggested another. . 5 ' ' I 
“Just what I was going to propose,” replied the _ 2- '
leader. “But I don't believe any one man has: '1
$2,400,000 tied up in the stock. More likely they :3
are held by some big estate or bank, and they-. 
will not be thrown on the market. However. ‘I’lli'_ 7

tomorrow and see what happens.” ’ , 0 ‘ j
So next day I_I. & O. began to slump badly, and
Bob. to save his stock, had to put up another‘
$300,000 in margin, as the price dropped to ‘70
and then to 68._ It recovered to 71 that afternoon,’ ’
but next day it was raided again‘, and dropped.
so close to 60 that Bob had to put up another’
$300,000,mai-gin. In order to do this he had 
hypothecate $60,000 worth of his W. P. & B. stock-
to make up the $40,000 he was short. The syn?
dicate ﬁnding that a drop of 19 points did not
shake out any of the 30,000 shares, concluded that;

A‘ few days later it was back at'80, the price he-
paid for it, and he got back another $300,000 ‘bf

 Bob learned one day that it emissaries of the.

gW‘estchester Traction Companywere tampering

‘with his motormen and trying to foment a strike
among them. so as to hurt the road. He sent sev-
feral" Pinkerton detectives to the ground and three
of: the men were arrested. They were put
through akind of third degree and admitted that
they "were employed by the Westchester people to
make trouble. .. Bob called on the Preﬁldent Of the
tractioncompany, and protested. against such un-
fair ‘tactics. Thepresident denied that his com-
paiiy. was at the bottoin of anysuch thing. Then
Bob produced the sworn_stateme1rts_ of the pris-
faneys and told the president that if they tried
any more dodges of that kind on his line there

’ ighrouldt be trouble.

 ‘He ‘gave copies’ of the documents to the press,
and statements from his own motormen, making a
pretty bad showing for the Westchester Com-
pany. ‘They didn't appear, however, as the astute
editors sent proofs of the articles to the general.

exhibition of pluck, foresight and energy. ’
The consequence was that the Street took its’.
hat off to Bob. and reckoned him as an expanding
power in the money realm. The fight went on, »
but there was fresh interest in it now. It Was“.
Bob against the money kings, and there were
many now willing to.bet that the little speculatoig
would come out on top, ‘for money alone isn’—lj." V 
everything in this world. Bob, you may wellﬂbe-it _ 
lieve, wasn’t asleep at any stage of the "game. 
He was watching‘ the Westchester money ma’g- . I '
nates like a. hawk. They had no idea that hekept’ ’ ‘
such a close’ surveillance on their actions, and“ " «
supposed that all his thoughts were centered’ in« 
the trolley line. ' ’ ~ . ‘ ‘ y _ 
Bob had a. dozen smart boys shadowing the ,
men wherever they went, either down in ,Wall 
Street or at home. He paid them princely wages, ‘ _. 1

and they were faithful to him, from the ground * " ’

floor up. In this way one day Bob learned-thath’ "
these money kings had’ decided to work, a little
game on the public. Their plan. was to depress ‘
the price of: their own road so as to force out a .: _’
lot_ of people who had purchased the stock at high ’ e
prices. When the price got as low as they could ‘jg
put it they intended to buy in the stock, put up — T
the price again. and then sell it over again at a .,
high ﬁgure as before. It was simply one of the

what is called ashort sale, for Bob wasselling 

something he didn’t.have, and would have to buy  V,
in order to deliver at the right time. - Daly sold,  
the stock at 115, and his offer was greedily 
snapped up. That afternoon the broker of thew 
magnates began a‘ raid on Westchesterl-and by.~.4_
tricks known to the initiated forced it downto W 1’
110. ‘At that price Bob bought 20,000 and deliv-, V

it was gilt-edged. Bob‘ got 10,000 shares for,90;
and 20,000 each‘ at 92. 93 and 95. Daly kept on
offering to buy and the price went up to 100, the
-’ . magnates, not daring to sell any more. In an-
‘other week it was back to 115, and Bob_began to

unload quietly.
He had bought two more lots of 5,000 at 98 and

, 100, and 10,000 more at 105. In‘ all he had nearly
’ " — a million up on margin when he began to sell. He

" ’ got rid‘ of all his holdings at 115 and made the big
proﬁt of $1,800,000, raising his cash capital to

' $3,700,000. Then he staggered the money kings

by going to the president of the Westchester
, Traction Company and offering to uy‘ out the
49,900 shares of   &- B. Trolley Company for
’ 30, and take the million dollars’ worth of the com-
pany's bonds off their hands at the market price.
The president refused to make the deal as a mat-
‘ter of course.'but the offer gave the magnates a
terrible shock. They held a ‘special meeting to
« consider the situation. _  * / _

 . , ‘‘It|‘is clear that boy ‘has unlimited backing,”
‘said the president. “How he has managed to in-
terest capital in that bankrnpt road gets me, but
he has done it. He is certainly a hummer. That
~ -‘boy will run Wall Street one of these days, mark

' my words. No ordinary boy, or man, for that
"  wmatter, could beat us the way we have been
» beaten in our attempt to get hold of that inde-
penjd t line. The best thing we can do, gentle-
men, is to call the ﬁght oﬁ and try to compro-
'mise.‘ We need-the W. P. dz. B. line in our sys-
tem. Let us take this young speculator in with
us. He is a wonder. and will be a power on our _
side as he is atvnresent against us.” _

The presidenﬂsjwords created a sensation at
. the meeting‘. It led to a long and heated discus-
sion. , The other money kin s did not want to sur-
render to a boy. It was ri iculous, they claimed.

“Well. what are we going to do about it, gen-
tlemen?” asked the ‘president.’ A ”
 “Keep up‘ the‘ ﬁght!" ‘roared a stout director

with a red face. . . ‘ ~_
 “I'd rather losea million than give in,” chimed

in‘another bis: man. violently pounding the table.
‘ , ’ “So would I,” said a third. ,
" ‘ And a fourth said the same.‘ The president,
, who seemed to have a clearer view of the case‘
than the dthers.-was inclined to compromise,‘ but;
-the question being ut to vote the opposition car-'
» ried it, and so the fight was not called off.

; could not get a share. One day Bob noticed that

S. & T. shares were steadily falling in the market.
' He could not account for that fact, as the road
was a good one and was not reported as being in
any diﬂiculty. Bob watched it right along and
ﬁnally became satisﬁed that some combination
was depressing it for purposes of its own. The

H - young speculator having so much money lying

- idle, he decided to buy S. & T. and see how he
.would come out. He began by telling Broker
 Daly to buy all he could get at the market. In
. three days Daly had secured 40,000 shares, all he
7 could find. at 52. Three days later there was a
. -tremendous bear raid made on the stock, but_Bob
‘ didn’t care’, for he had bought the shares_ outright,
 paying $2,000,000 for them, and still had a mil-
’ ~ lion and three-quarters in cash.
j .1 The price went as low as 40, and Bob kept buy-
Ting in all that was offered. ‘Thus the syndicate,
, V which was selling short, had.to come u with 20,-
. ’-. 000'shares,« for which the members ha paid over
_ '50, ‘in order to keep its engagements. This was
‘ an unpleasant dose for the combine to swallow,
causing a loss of nearly $300,000 right there.
. After that the stock went up, and at 60 Bob began
ate? unload, selling 20,000 at_ about that price and
clearing $150,000; The price.kept on _up and at
70. Bob told his broker to sell out all his holdings
quietly, so as not to disturb the market. So Da_ly
' ’ went to the S. & T. pole and began offering it.
HTl:e syndicate was obliged to take it in to save
., themselves. and 20,000 shares went their way that
day‘ at a proﬁt of $350,000 to the little speculator.
Next day Daly offered’ the rest in 5,000 lots. The
isyndicate took what the other brokers refused, but
i it staggered them. 
 Bob was hardly out of it with $300,000 more
proﬁt before» something alarmed the brokers, and
' the whole of them began throwing S. & T. on the
market. Everybody seemed to have an idea that‘
tlzieprice was going to tumble and, rushedxto save
, themselves. .The result was that,-with hardly any

(A Serial Story.)
CHAPTER XI.»-—The Picture in the Light

: . But the description of-’ these ﬁictures in. the
light must be reserved for anot er chapter, as
they proved to be of the highest importance
L inthe solution of the mystery which had gathered
‘ out the missing diamonds that came by express.
h It began after Mr. Bum, the fakir, hadbeen
 playing his ﬂageolet about twenty minutes, and
e first thin Will thought he saw was .a hand
 ust out 0% the ﬂame and suddenly drawn
, again. .
 . L It was a large hind, and decidedly hairy. The
 T }sight of it did not disturb him in the ,.least.
.  -Any old thing went with Will that night; he

L ‘were "long and slender,,like the hands of women,
'" land others still were children’s hands; but all

 

  
  
 

 

 

; were dark like the doctor's and those of Mr. Bum,
*  the fakir. ’  l l

 Then suddenly, as the music rose and fell, the
Q . hands disappeared,‘ and the pictures began to
"  /come. _  

i" V . It is hard to explain just how W111 saw .them
‘ "or dreamed that he saw them, but .somehow they

‘fﬂseemed to form themselves in the ﬂames.

 

  

Lfront of LAllén’,s Express office; L He appeared to
e counting his packages and checking them‘ off

his book. V _

5 Then like a ﬂash the picture changed, and there
9 was again in his wagon, but it was on, Maiden
one. Yes, the wagon was in front of. the old

Fauilding where the murder had taken place.

i Everything about the picture was perfect.

‘Will could ‘see the store ‘windows, with their dis-_

lay of jewelry and silverware, and the lights

  

  
   
     
     
  
 
 
 
 
  

g up and «down the Lane, and thereeven was
 ‘s Little terrier “Spot” beside him on the seat,
‘ arkin at the assers-by. .

;1uAs. or himse f,. he was leaning over to take,a
fpackage out of the wagon. It was the package
lof diamonds. He was reading the address—“Kar1
utter.”_ He saw himself jump"’out of the wagon

I’

This time Will as not in it. It was the'o1d‘ L \
lapidary alone. . '> ~ 
Will saw him lay the package on the ‘little’

counter, take a knife, and cut the strings. Then
he slowly opened it, and up went his hands, and
his placid face became ﬁlled with amazement: L _ 
Wi1lTsaw it all, even to the diamonds. This , ‘
picture was progressive, one thing succeeding“ 
another like “living pictures” thrown on a screen.
And such diamonds. ,- ] T
It was an amazing display. , - ’ l ;
All had been removed from their" settings; V ‘ h
each of the larger ones was enclosed in a. paper .
by itself, and the old lapidary ‘opened each paper ;— ,
in turn. \ ‘ —  ’
There was a small oblong box in thepackage: ‘V
which he opened last. 3 , l .s "
This contained what appeared to be diamonds ‘
of huge size. A I . g V ' 
’Wil1 saw the lapidary laugh -as he took theni. ~
up one by one." A . — *
“These,” he thought, “must be
diamonds the doctor spoke of.” _ , .
Then he remembered the Great Ghorgeel; L ’ L 
It was there! Karl Kutter had ldiscoveredg ,1:
it. He laughed no longer——l1is eyes opened Wide.   1
He seized the huge stone eagerly and applied l ‘
a glass to it. «  ' 
It was as big as a pigeon’s egg, and was, cut Q ,
without a “table,” as the flat surface forming“ ‘ 
the top of the ordinary get is called. , -  ¢ 5-
There was little glitter to it, however, and it A ' 
looked less like a genuine diamond than some of

the imitation“  1 

  

Will seemed to know instinctively that this“ 
must be the Great’ Ghorgee. \ . ~ l l * , .7
After examining it attentively through the7 
glass .for a few, moments, Karl Kutter ‘took it i i
to his bench and proceeded to wach it with some] L’:
liquid which he poured out of a small bottle. ' * 
Evidently this_ removed the substance which“ i "
had been spread over the diamond to concealits _» 
true character,. and it shone out like a blazing-V“g,l:

  

Picture_after picture followed each other  7 .,
great rapidity. To describe them all(would take 
far too much space. 1 V  

The next one of real importance, to our story’
was that which showed the old lapidary when he i

  
 

hide them. . L _
At first he had looked at the safe. \ b _.  
That, it will be remembered, was entirely‘-ﬁﬂégd,  I

 

with drawers. V L ., - .. 
‘The big‘ diamonds and the large imitation 
stone could not have gone’ into any of the shallow T’ ‘ l
drawers and the drawer been shut on account of
their size. T’ '~ V j ‘ » i l ' ‘V
Apparently for some reason not to.»be shown‘
in thegpictures the lapidary did not wish. 0 carry‘
the diamonds out of the place,,and as ' e, could»
not put them in the safe it was necessary it
secrete them‘ somewhere.  T j 
Then came the last picture which showed how
hedidit. i. s ,3

which had been thrust into it. - ‘
In this, last picture Will saw Karl Kutter stand-
‘ ing‘ on aﬁchair by the chimney. He pulled out
‘ the -paper and _-thrust the package of diamonds
into" the Stovepipe hole,_then restored the paper.
. As this picture vanished the music of the
ﬁageolet ceased, and_ W111, who surely had been
in a sort of a half trance, came to himself again.

They ushed on to Maiden Lahe, reached the

meeting no one on the way, and attracting no
special attention. ‘

“We are in luck,” whispered the doctor when

 I    FOUND HIS BOY  

Tom Merry was a bachelor of thirty, but he
looked considerably older at the time, and more
especially when he was in a thoughtful mood.

He was in a thoughtful mood as he was crossing
the South Ferry to Brooklyn one night, after ,he
had put in a weary day in a lawyer’s office in the
lower part of the City of New York. ' ,

., As _the boat was pushing into the sli a little
boy toddled out of the cabin toward im, and
caught him by the coat as he lisped forth:

1: a an» > ‘

At that moment a tall woman, wearing a dark

veil, followed the child out of the cabin, and
 caught him as if to draw away from Tom, as she

" said in husky tones:

“You bad boy, that is not your father. Please
excuse the child, sir.”

 The people were hurrying out of the boat at
 the moment, and as .the little fellow still_ clung to
 Tom Merry, he bent down and raised him in his
7arms,.s‘aying, in his good:natui-ed tones.

' .,“All right, madam, I will take the little fellow
up over the bridge.‘ .

, .,And without waiting for the consent of the
lady, who was dressed_in black, he sprang up

toward .the ferry gate with the little boy who ap-

‘peared to cling to him in the most friendly man-

.ner. The lady followed hastily, and ‘when she

reached the gate a tall man, who appeared to be

   
   
  
   
  
   
   
  
  
 
  
   
    
 
  
 
  
    
   
   
    

sprang at her and seized her by the arm crying:
. “I have caught*you at last! Now I want you to
come right home with me." .

‘.fYou are mistaken, sir, as I do notknow you.

“yéu shouldn't break her arm in that way, and I
‘ask you to; let-her go also.” _ . _ _

and aiming a blow at Tom’s face. ‘

‘him, and he warded off the blow with his right

himself in cold water. Tom thought of his war _

fore, and -he had sent the manuscript for publica-i
tion to several publishers, but it had been rejected
time and aga.in.~ «.

That novel was at last accepted by a good house, ‘ I  i

and Tom was ‘offered a fair price for it at’ a time
when he was sadly in need of’ a few dollars.

On reaching the house he fouhd that no one had "
come to inquire about the little stranger, and he
then hastened away to the station-house to make
inquiries there. . ’

Yes, a young woman had inquired about the boy
veryearly in the morning, and the sergant had

given her both the Brooklyn and the New York '

ity addresses of the man who had taken charge
of him for the night. i

Tom Mei'ry'- hastened. back to his boarding:- ‘ ,. V
house again, only to learn that the _child’s mother ‘ ' ’
' had not called there as yet.

On reaching his old employer's oﬁice in the
afternoon he found a letter addressed to him in a
lady’s ﬁne handwriting,

It was from the boy's mother, and in it she‘. '

begged him, in the most imploring terms, to care v
for the child for the present, while she promised
to remunerzite him for his trouble.
The letter concluded by saying: .. \
“The man who assailed me last night has been
the bane of my life, and he is not my husband, but

he is my child’s uncle. The child’s father died six _ - ’
months ago, and he did. resemble you very inu.ch.. 
“I am, compelled to ﬂy in haste from the .

wretch who is persecuting me, and '1 dare not take
my boy with me, fearing that his uncle would

pursue me through him. I cannot give you my».-

name or my future address, as goodness only
knows where I will have to fly. If you have tne

heart of a man, take care of the child for his own '

sake, and he will reward. you in future if I do not.

“It may be days, months, or even years before .

regret the kindness you may show the little boy,

 I,  Some years before his father became involved
’ in a disgraceful affair in the great city, and Tom
‘thought it best to travel under an assumed name.

‘Very soon after taking charge of the boy, reve- v

lations appeared in the New York papers which
proved that he was an innocent man, and that he
was the victim of clever sharpers.

 ' _About the time that the revelations were pub-
, lished, Tom received a splendid offer from a mer-

, cantile house in San Francisco, and he went to
, thatcity, taking little Massey, as the boy called

himself, with him. . .-

v— On arriving on theshores of the Paciﬁc, the
honest fellow assumed, his real name again, and
that was Tobias Merriman. .

'  [When young Massey Merriman, as he was

51.  ~,called, was ﬁfteen years of age, his father took

" ‘him on a trip to the. East, and they arrived in the

, city of New York in safety.

‘ . 3‘ . Desiring to know if the strange lady had ever

. ‘made inquiries about her son, he called at the

  ’9ii‘lce of the old lawyer, where he found two letters

‘ awaiting him there for over eight years.

, They were both written from London by Mas-
eey’s mother, and one of them inclosed a draft for
 one hundred dollars. . _

» ’ The letters from London were signed “Emma

" ., ‘ Wheeler,” and the lady who called at the lawyer’s

-, office gave the same name, but she did not leave

' ‘any address or state when she would call again.

’ ' " The anxious man left his New York address for

' the time with the old lawyer, and then hastened

A away ‘to insert advertisements in the New York

apers addressed to Emma Wheeler, in which“
e intimated where Thomas Merry could be found.

f A '' “Blame my eyes, if that isn’t just like the voice
7 y ‘of the woman I heard on the ferry-boat that night.
- Can it be that it is my mascot’s mother?”
»' Merriman kept asking the ‘question during the
whole performance, and he was asking it still
» when they went out into the street, while he con-
i or ‘tinned, saying: -
Q .“If I could only ﬁnd out where she is stopping,
. I would call on her this very night."

Christ by Lamas and telling about His travels
and preaching in India, Tibet and Central Asia,
has been veriﬁed by the Roerich art expedition,
the Boerich Museum here announced a few days
ago, the Associated Press says. , ,

The manuscripts will throw much light on the
vague years of Christ’s life before his returnto
Jerusalem in His twenty-ninth year, it is believed.

‘The expedition, in and around the Chinese Tur-
kestan since 1923. was detained in Central Asia
by the Daotai of Hotan, but later was released
after its arms were confiscated, according to the
museum.

Nicholas Roerich, painter, philoso her and
mystic; Mrs. Roerich and their son eorge, an _  *
authority on Oriental languages, made up the ex- ..
nedition, whichleft America early in 1923. They
have sent back to the museum at No. 322 River- * ,
side» Drive more than one hundred and ﬁfty .
paintings, embracing an entire artistic panorama
of the Far East’s historiesxand legends. .

 

 

ORY OF SUN AS A VORTEX SPINNING - E '
_ WITH UNEQUAL SPEEDS — 5‘ -  :9.
That the sun, instead of rotating like the earth, E 
areas on whose surface revolve at a speed pro-5‘ ’
portionately greater than the areas near its cen-_
tre. is a sort of vortex spinning rapidly in the
middle and more slowly at the outside,'is the new -
and revolutionary theory advanced by Dr. J. H. « i
Jeans. the British scientist. ’ , I
Doctor Jeans. ‘who was Professor of Applied». .
Mathematics at Princeton University for four‘
years and Research Associate at Mount Wilson. = .
Observatory three years ago, has laid his view 
before the Royal Astronomical Society. ‘ _
It disputes the opinion, held ever since Gallileo 5* g ,
first noted how the sun spots traveled across the ' ,
disk, that the sun. like the earth, rotated all in  
one piece. ‘ ' , , ‘ ‘ ‘ '
Radiation is held by Doctor Jeans to be the fac-
tor which accounts for the fact that the speed « .'—
rotation of the sun is much less near the surface . . . 7
than at the centre. Until recently radiation was ‘
thought to be immaterial, so tliatit could pass »

 
 

freely through the body of the sun.

“In the modern view, however,” says Professor ,
H. H.‘ Turner. Professor of Astronomy of Oxford . 
University, commenting on Doctor J ean’s the-~
ory, “radiation has become material, so that on w _
its way from the hot centre of the sun outward to C 
the cooler surface it puts an increasing brake on ,

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
  

speed of the outer layers to a‘ mere fraction of '
that of the inner. »  . t
“It is jostled by the layers and‘ jostles them in
turn. During its ascent to the surface its ro-

tating speed would be continuously increased’ ‘.
the jostling layers, and these, by reaction, would
themselves begcorrespondingly slowed down. The’
layers would be successively impeded more and
more, the outermost, suffering the ‘most severely.
Thus the stream» of particles from'the centre_of'
the sun outward" would ultimately . reduce’ ,th_ .

speed of the outer layers considerably.”-
