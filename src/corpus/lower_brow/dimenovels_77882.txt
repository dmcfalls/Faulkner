ings of the detective as he sat beside his table in his own
bedroom, dressed only in his pajamas, at an hour that was
"between three and four ‘o'clock in the morning,_ engaged
‘in ‘listening over the telephone to this vital conversation
that was at once sodistant, and its locality so unknown.

in thelife of the detective.

the struggle had occurred would act almost as a receiver_,,
for the persons there, he placed his lips quickly against ‘F
his own transmitter, and shouted out with all the strength 

“Hands up, Strovanoff, or I’ll kill you!”

Without waiting to listen for the effect. of his words, in"

tective dashed the receiver upon the hook, seized his"

The streets of the city at that hour are almost de-

just what it would be best for him to do, and then? he 
turned abruptly and walked around to the opposite’ side . 
of the vessel away from the wharf, intending as soon, as

It was at once evident that the launch had been ob-

 

” served'from the deck of the ship for some time, for in

fggpaddition to the pilot and the ﬁrst officer of the vessel,

upon the bridge, there were four other men there, evi-
dently the captain himself, probably one of them was
Strovanoff, and there were others as well. i

 gun and the waving of the blue ﬂag by the colonel, there

was no cessation in the speed of the vessel, and no move—

 
 

 
  
  
   
  
  
   
  
    
  
  
  
  
    
  
     
   
  
  
  

cate that they intended to stop, but the detectivg and his
friends could see several glasses leveled upon them, and
it was xrapidly becoming evident that the sight of uni-
} forms of the United States, in the launch, was having its
— effect. V i _ . ,
.‘In the«rneantime the ensign had ‘slipped a second car-
Vtridge. into the gun, and now he fired again, after ‘which’
he also leaped to his feet and waived another ﬂag which

to threaten, and Nick saw the captain raise his right hand ,
as if to strike the Russiannihilist, but he dropped the‘,

The thinnest man was sent up the perfectly straight chim-
ney, but he quickly returned to tell the tale that it couldn’t
be done in that way. After a hurried council among the
seven, they then picked the locks of the other cells, and
requisitioned the liberated prisoners’ sheets, which were cut
