g »‘ CI-IAVPTER IV.--Mr. Flint Tries to ‘Pump Tom.

,Tom‘ approached the front door of the road-

» house with some caution. vHe had seen Mr. Flint

. _ standing there a few moments before, had seen
him lookingup the road at him, and had seen him

' 3 go in. Any other boy would probably have stolen

Mrs. Flintsummoned him to supper.

-v: { Tom, however, did things differently from other
‘ ‘ boys. There wasn’t a particle of cowardice about
,2 him. If he was in for a scolding he‘ believed in
facing the music and getting over with it at once.
At the same time he believed in protecting him-
self as much as possible. He remembered that
, Mr. Flint had thrown the bung-starter at him and
f that it had fallen into the bushes by the road-
. house. He wondered if his employer had recov-
T , erediit. Very likely he had, for it was an indis-
pensable article about the bar—room. Still he
thoughthe would make sure about it. Somewhat
 to his surprise the bung-starter lay where it had
/ fdlen. Tom picked it up and went on. He had

. , no intention of using it as a weapon against his
employer, but he recognized the fact that it was a
very handy thing to have in case of emergency.
3 Without a tremor he walked u to the entrance
of‘ the roadhouse and looked in. He thought it
-_ advisable to reconnoiter before entering, lest Mr,
' Flint be ambushed behind the door in readiness to
 take him at .a sudden disadvantage.

CHAPTER V.—Tom Receives a Letter.

“V: “Are you Tom Tucker?” asked the boy, when

‘ _  hero”came out. it i
, 1- “I was told to hand you this letter,” said Vth
'  messenger. ., -

“_Who gave it to you to give me?”
“He didn’t give me no name. He wasn’t very
- ‘well dressed, wore a slouch hat, and his collar
(was turned up so as to hide a part of his face.
" -‘He said I must be sure to give this letter to you
and nobody else. I'm to take him back 231 an-
swer.”  y _ ‘
"1 *_  Tom" opened the envelope, which was’ carefully
i sealed, and took, out the enclosure._ Turning up
lane of the lamps he read the following:
“My Dear Boy: You will doubtless be sur-
rised to learn that I have ventured to come to
.. geacliff-—.the place associated with the greatest
T misfortune of my life, huh I have just made an
._important discovery which concerns your futurh
rospects. While cleaning out an old desk which
longed’, to your father I unexpectedlylcame

 

 

 

 

 across a memorandum which leads me to believe
i »that the proofs needed to establish your right to
"’t.‘he‘ Rutherford estate, now in possession of your
father's cousin, Richard Rutherford, to whose
treachery I owe a life prison sentence, but from
which, as you know, I escaped after serving one
year, are hidden somewhere in the .o1d,;Revolu-
tionary Watch Tower still existing in_a‘ ruinous
state at the extreme end of." Bird’ Poiiituto the
east of the village. I have come down here,’
therefore, to hunt for the precious documents,
' and this "will give me the op.portunity of seeing
‘ ‘you once more.  « t, .
  “Yours faith£u11y,u ANDR.EW'CRAWF'0RD.”

‘ ; ‘.‘P .-—Meet,» me to—night at nine at the Old
Wat Tower. I will watch for your coming. If
you think anything will prevent you from coming
(say to he bearer No, otherwise Yes. Be sure
and des my this note after you .have read it.’?

  
     

 
  

Tom put the note carefully into his pocket and
walked/over to the messenger. ‘

“Tell the man ‘Yes’,” he said in a low tone.
g"‘All right,” answered the boy, who immediately

“Hush!” replied the roadhouse keeper. .
 He had found out nothing, and was much ‘dis-
ap ointed thereat. Tom resumed his seat at the
1e and ﬁnished his supper in silence. As soon
(as he was through he went-. outside‘ in the yard

The appearance of Mrs. Flint with a stack in
dishes in her arms interrupted the current. of his

These unfavorable indications did not deter
either Mr. Flint or_ Tom Tucker from making‘
‘ their waytoward'the Old Wat

Both had been there before and knew the way
in spite of the gloom that shroud

The village of Seacliﬂ’ was reckoned a mile

from the roadhouse,_and the Watch Tower was ‘ _

about the same distance at a right angle.

The village would, long sincephave extended 
to the vicinity of the Point, but for a broad in-'

for that reason.

If it had only been on the other side of the

bay, which was a ‘barren stretched of sand and

' was the person who threw the bit of wood in order
to create a diversion in Crawford's favor, and
-‘thus enable him to escape from his critical pre-
dicament, realized that in helping his friend he
had. placed himself in a dangerous situation. He
had but a few moments to decide what he should

. do in order to extricate himself, if that were
.possible. .

‘.‘The_re’s two. against me, and both armed with

. revolvers,” he muttered. “If I’m caught Ruther-

> less than my death. It’s too bad they are between
me and the door. They’ll have the lantern lighted

‘ ,again before .I could pass them. What shall
i I do?” .
Then it was that he thought: of the stairs lead-

ing to the mined ﬂoor above, and he determined

to risk retreat in that direction. He was near the
ﬂight, and he thought perhaps he might make

his escape without being. seen or heard. As quick.

action was necessary he lost no time in putting
the plan into execution. But unfortunately the
" stairs were creaky from age, His weight, light
as it was, brought forth sounds that drew the
V men's attention in that direction. The lamp was
,lighted and ﬂashed upon his retreating ﬁgure, '
“There he is,” cried Rutherford. “By the
gods, it’s a. boy,” _ v A _' .
He pulled out his revolver, took a hurried aim
andﬁred. Tom felt a tug on his trousers leg
as the bullet tore its way through the folds of
the cloth- Two more shots followed in rapid suc-
cession, but he was not hit, and he sprang out of
~ range upon the ﬂoor above. His situation, now
‘ff that hisline of retreat was known, was not im-
‘V proved. Indeed,’ "it was worse, if anything, than
v before. He realized that he was cornered in a
. a spot that apparently was furnished with no ave-
V nue of escape. He was surrounded with hea s of
rubbish and the broken and crumbling wal s of
the upper story; He heard the ‘steps of the two
_men on the stairs following him, and he lmew
jhat he must either, surrender and meet his fate,
or spring from the top of the Tower ‘into the
‘ darkness. On two sides was a sheer descent of
" eighty feet to the jagged rocks on which the
_ ocean was dashing. in tumultuous confusion. A
<2, >leap at either 'point meant practically certain
: 1 death, ‘
“'1 ' The other sides overlooked the ground thirty
feet below, but on one of the sides the ground was
' ittered with fra‘gments of the ruin, and promised
broken bones. Only in front, where the door was,
the ‘ground was clear, but to leap even there was
_ to court injury likely to place him at the mercy
of his pursuers. In running/to the top of the
Tower, Tom had not considered these facts. His
'~_sole object was to get out of the room below
‘before a search of the place revealed his presence
"there. Now he saw he had run into a trap. The
storm was now over, having passed,out to sea,
the dark clouds overhead were breaking up, per-'
_ mitting the moon to show herself at intervals.
, Tom insti-nctly looked f r a place to conceal
himself. The highest part (hf the wall overlooked’
" the ocean, and it was overrun by a dense mass

of English ivy. The only available hiding place,

unconscious that their departure was watched by
a pair. of eyes, peering at them through the

‘bushes close by. As soon as they were well on

their way the owner of the eyes crept"from his

place of concealment and followed slowly after ‘ V

them to a point whereithe. village path diverged“

to the right. There he paused and looked after
their- retreating ﬁgures. At that moment the
moon, which had been obscured for a time, sailed

out into a patch of clear sky, and its light shone ’

full on the person’s face. It revealed_.the lean

and smoothly shaven countenance of Amos Flint. ‘ T

A self-satisﬁed‘ expression rested on his features;
while a grim chuckle came from his lips. ,Then
he turned away and took the other path which
led straight in the direction of the roadhouse.

When Tom Tucker felt himself falling down the ‘
precipitous side of the Watch Tower he gave ‘

himself up for lost. .

Tom looked up

the ivy, which was clear to his sight in the

‘ saw a long,-bare place bereft of the ivy, the wreck

"“That was a ﬁerce place to fall from,’ he said

' ‘;‘I am glad he has not gone away yet," thought
the boy.

' "whom'he owed his life, and who had already spent

eleven years unavailingly in an effort not only
[to clear his own character of a crime he Was not
-,;'guilty,of, but to bring’ the real criminal to justice
and secure the boy his birthright. His footsteps
made no sound on the rain-soaked grourld, and

‘ C1; wford was ,not aware of his presence.

“Hope, Mr. Crawford,” spoke up Tom, step:

W;

the boy himself gotinto bed in his own room on ;
the ﬂoor above at the back, and was soon asleep. ‘

It was Mr. Flint’s habit every morning at ﬁve to, It
go to the foot of the attic stairs and yell out ,7‘: ‘
Tom’s name to expeditephis appearance dow_n- 
stair". On the morning following the events just ;
narrated he omitted that procedure. He reasoned.’ “
that it would be a useless waste of breathto call‘ . J
a boy whose corpse was either on the rocksat the, :
foot of Bird Point, or ﬂoating about somewhere‘ ~-
out at sea. That Tom could have escaped after’
that fall did not seem reasonable enough to ﬁgure ~
on. So he went about lighting the kitchen ﬁre»
himself, which was Tom’s first duty. While he
was thus employed the,boy came downstairs. Mr.

went almost white.

Was this Tom’s ghost? The door opened and I
the boy entered. ‘ Mr. F1int’s jaw dropped and he? 
stared at him. Then~he recovered his self-posses- , T
sion, for there was nothing ghostly about the boy.
“I didn’t hear you call me, Mr. Flint,” Tom. ;.
said. “Am I late?” '  j

A glance at the clock showed him that it was
only ten minutes after ﬁve. . ..

“When did you get in?” asked the roadhouso
keeper. . '* '

“Pretty near midnight, sir.” , 9

"Hum! You were out late. Wherewere you'.'_”,

“I went to meet an old friend who sent me wo
that he was in the village.” _ .  , 1

Mr. Flint was about to ask him another ques—l'
tion, but it "struck him that maybe"he had better
not, so he told Tom to tackle the fire and went’

I

out to the barn. ‘

“How in creation did he escape?” the old man“
“I wouldn't have ‘given a penny,
for his life after that fall. And here he comes

still I reckon it’s true enough, for he paid the ‘
chap who came into the Tower last nightto make,
away with the boy years ago when he was little——- $5,‘
I mean when the boy was little-—which it appears ‘

he didn’t -do. The chap in question was tried fo
the murder of the*boy’s father and got :3. Hi -

ought to make a good thing out of what I hear

; By the time he was called in to breakfast, Mr.
Flinti ha_d outlined his plan of action, and two
hours later, dressed in his best suit, he started
for the village to call on Richard Rutherford at
Squire Pryor’s home'on Elm street. On reaching
:5 househe asked for Mr. Rutherford when, to
is surprise and _disappointment, he was informed
that the gentleman had departed for Boston by
 eight o’clock train. Thus‘ was Mr. Flint’s

» ‘turned home in very bad humor indeed.

“You had some trouble about taking the buggy, " '

how he had tumbled that man into the -dirt as-”
he was rea.ching~for the bridle rein of the buggy} »

had not doubt but the directors of the company

The deed was recorded at Cranston, tlie‘,cou1'ity'

dicated as trustee for Tom Tucker did no 
come known to the people of Seacliﬂ’. \ , ‘
Bessie and her mother left the "village," Tom '
rected his attention to his property. His fa
tract with Mr. Flint had still.six weeks,to'f , y
and the old man had magdehim an offer _to re-
main all winter which Tom took under conside
tion. ‘He had an idea of accepting it as he _w  _,

he felt like it. had his scheme for blot

. letter: ~He_*and Bessie had arranged to corre-
.; spond regularly, and each week a letter passed

 

 between them. Little by little Tom took the girl a

into his conﬁdence with respect to the draining
of the marsh and its conversion into good, solid
‘ground. He explained to her all the advantages
"that would accrueto him when this was accom-
'_' lished, and said that the only thing that stood
between himand success was the money he need-
"ed to do.the business. A day or- two before he_
S »was to give his answer to Mr. "Flint he received
,a letter from Mr. Brown inviting him to Boston
to" spend a week at his‘ home. After considering
the matter he" interviewed the roadhouse keeper.
' “I’ll stay with you this winter on the terms
~you have offered me provided you have no ob-
.jection to me taking a week off in Boston. Mr.
' Brown hasdinvited me to put in a week at his
house ” sai Tom. . . .
’ “All right,” replied Mr. Flint, so a new'agree-
: nient-was drawn up and Tom signed it.-- ,
1 The roadhouse keeper then paid him what was
 coming to him. Tom wrote to Mr. Brown ac-
‘ ‘cepting his invitation and said he could come dur-
" ing the first or second week in November, which
was the most convenient to that gentleman and
V vhisfamily. The second week was decided on and
' on the ﬁrst Saturday afternoon of the month Tom
‘started for Boston. He received a royal welcome,
esYiecial'l_v from Bessie, _and enjoyed every moment
‘of his visit hugely. Toward the end of his stay
,,Mr,. Brown called him into his -‘library and told
him ‘Bessie had spoken to him about the marsh
,:project, and suggested that he ﬁnance it. He
-said ,he was willing to do it provided it was
‘feasible. - _
“Now vl’ll telljyou what I’ll do. I’ll send a
-practical en ineer down to seeyou some day
inext week. %‘ake him over the ground and ex-
plainlyour scheme. V If he reports to methat it

' “Yes, sir; but if you advance the money it must

('.Mr. Brown agreed to that, though he had no

Monday mornin Tom returnedfto Mr. F1int’s
‘mploy fullof ho over his future. ,Owing ‘to.
;‘the.7f‘ailure of Mr. lint’s persistent efforts _to
Qﬁnd the precious papers that would restore him
.¢to.v his birthright, Tom had given up hope of re- A
‘écovering them, and made only one search himself,
which amounted to nothing. _

CHAPTER XV.—Conclusion.

In a‘few days Tom got a letter from vMi‘.,
Brown in which the gentleman said that the"
engineer had rendered a favorable report of the,
marsh project, and therefore he would undertake.-5
to advance the amount the expert submitted as(_
the probable cost of the work. ’1_‘_om repliedthat‘ Q
he would accept the loan when the time came .7‘,
to begin the work, which would not be before, 
spring. Every Sunday afternoon that the _
weather" was good Tom went to the Point and° "
mounting to the upper ﬂoor of the Tower studied
the marsh, and ii red on what he would do with
the‘ spot when it ad been "transformed into*goo‘d.
real estate. On one of’ these" occasio s he ac-w
cidentally dropped his jack-knife, and _. fell inbii.
a clump of bushes he picked up a bad‘ rusted
revolver, which had evidently been’ there for
years. He concluded to carry it to house and’
try and clean it. He got some oil and .emoz-yx
paper andstarted to clean off the rust. H8-"b€g~ _

which had killed his father. He stopped furthe'1;1
work on it, wrapped it up in a piece of news-'

receivedreplies, and Mr. Flint wondered what
the‘correspondence meant. The old man hired

, About this time a big tug steamed into the
upen roadstead at Seacliﬂ’, towing aspile driver

 v and several scows loaded with spiles. The .spi1e-
« 0 driver was moored at the end of the marsh near-
~ , est. the village. 'On the same day a locomotive
pushed two old-fashioned coaches and eight -dump
“ cars full of, refuse stone up to the marsh and left
J’ them there. One of the coaches was rigged up

  
  
  

L,‘-long table and a culinary department. Fifteen
T ’ laborers and a colored cook came in the «cars in
. ;char’ge'of a. foreman. Tom was down at the
' 7 marsh at the time talking with the boss of the
spile-driver, and he went over to welcome the
workmen.

‘ , An hour later agentlemanly looking young

“fellow of two-and-twenty appeared on horseback ,
from the village, where he had arrived from
;,Crans.l_:on a short time before. He introduced

himself /to Tom as Fred White, an engineer sent
,  George Smith to help Tom carry out the job.
,  ext morning the spile-driver began driving a
e " double line of spiles along“the outer edge of the
j marsh before a large audience of villagers. A
5 ‘space equal to two spiles was left between each
 line, but this was closed at every sixth spile-~‘
' , that is, four spiles instead of two were driven at
;these points. As soon as the ﬁrstsection of the
double row of spiles was completed and closed
Jivpi the‘ laborers began wheeling. down barrows

full of broken stone, which in the meantime had
~ been mixed with cement, and dumped it intothe
{jspace between the two lines of spiles. The spec-

began to understand the object of
_ ‘It seemed clear that ‘a sort of sea-
» wall was being erected to bar the tide from the
Nmarsh, and that the ultimate object was the ﬁll-
',ing up of the marsh for good. "7 V .
‘  The next issue of the weekly villagepaper had
fa glowing account of the plan under way, and

‘predicted its success. The editor said that the
cyoompletion of the work, and the‘ erection of a
 summer hotel on the Point, would give Seacliﬂ’ a

boom, and he surprised the community with the
news that the project originated with Tom Tuck-
ér,'and that he was the owner of the Mason prop-
herty, and not Mr. Brown, who had simply taken
~ title for. the boy, who ‘had paid for‘ it with the

reward he ‘had received from the Eastern Rail-’
:road for saving the Boston express from a smash-
« t';p'in the cut. , ‘

"Spaces were left at intervals along the break-.
water for the tide to enter the marsh and ﬂow
/out again. These were subsequently closed when“,
, ire: wall was practically complete. The last two
< tgere closed at low tide. The work of ﬁlling in
" t e marsh then began, and when half completed’
a. pumping engine was put to work- By fall the
.,entire work. was done. , The marsh had disap-

earedand no one,‘not acquainted with the fact,
would have dreamed it had ever been there.

The news having‘ circulated _in the papers.
throughout the State severalhotel keepers came‘
down and Tom received an bffer of $25,000 from
one for the property. .He refused___it, but leased
the reclaimed section to a company for ten years

hotel‘ and cotta es. Durin the winter he was

one. He was engaged to Bessie who was now:
nineteen. It was a summer afternoon and both’
were standing on the upper ﬂoor of the Watch’ 
Tower at the, spot where Tom had crawled 
‘through the hole in the wall on the night of 
his awful experience. Bessie knew all aboutthe 
incident, and it made her shudder to look -down’: 
over the wall at the rocks and sea below. Sudé T T
denly some of the old stones gave Way and an ’ 5 
oblong tin case fell at Tom’s feet. He picked it 4‘
up in some wonderhtook off the ‘cover,and'pull‘ed’

“My gracious!” he cried. “Here are the miss: \

Next morning Tom took a train for Boston and
laced the papers in the hands of Mr. B;-owpffs’
awyer, who was also the company’s. legal ad-

viser. The lawyercalled on Richard‘ Ruther-
ford at the Roost and was surprised to ﬁnd him
dying from a wound received” an hour before at
the hands of Hawkins. Rutherford made a con»
fessio admitting that he had shot his cousin
John, nd that Andrew Crawford had no hand in’

OLDVGERMAN CASTLE IS DESTROYED  A
AGAIN .‘

Schloss Affing, an old landmark in Augsburg,‘ ,

was recently. destroyed by ﬁre. Legend has it 

' that on the site of the castle a Roman camp once

stood. The castle changed hands many times dur-
ing- the Middle Ages. Members of the House of
Wittlesbach, later the rulers of Bavaria, were. at
one time owners of Schloss Aﬂing. .

Albert Achilles. Elector of Brandenburg, burn-
ed the castle in 1462. It was rebuilt. Razed again
in the Thirty Years{ War, it was~‘rebu_ilt' in 1684. _
This time the main building is said to have been
completely destroyed, although the local ﬁre bri-
gade‘ managed t. salvage much of the furniture‘
and other valuables. As the great tower of the
castle gave way and fell among the burning debris
ﬁve ﬁremen were killed and ten injured.

Many of the romantic episodes in tales of the. p  in

House of Brandenburg took place in the vicinity
of thisucastle. Which Was one of the finest remain- '‘
ing examples ofa medieval German stronghold.

I I ran an engine on that same Gulfport & Bil-

ford road. , .
’.t,6I‘7S1_1ppOSe Baisley remembers Colonel Pinker-

, .11., _ . ' ,
''‘’Bais1ey remembered him perfectly, though the

‘gentleman had not come into power in his time.

,The colonel waslabout as reckless a man as

= one would be likely to find, even in a day’s jour-

ney in the “Paradise of Rogues.”

' He had been- president of a bank somewhere
in ‘the North, and in due time became the presi-
dent of the railroad company.

 In his younger days he had partly learned the
I trade of a, machinist, and in consequence he be-

.;.lieved that he -knew more about a locomotive than
any other man on the road.

'»He was mad if a train was two minutes be-

. hind time, and as he had appointed all the con-

ductors. himself, he charges the blame upon the

'.enginee1's.
a . He lived at Buckvale, where he had a very nice.
Tplace, built on the line of the road, so that he

(could tell at what time every train passed it.

_, _".‘Romsey, you are late,” said Colonel Pinker-
‘ ton to me one morning as I stopped my train at
;the Buckvale station. ,

“Two minutes, sir,” "I replied meekly, as I

‘looked at my watch.

“Five minutes!” retorted the colonel sharply.

, “It is only two minutes by my watch, which

V» “Don't contradict me, Romsey! You have said

nough! There is a better man than you are
that wants your place,” he continued, as he

,was right by the company’s time in Bilford this

' I 'I knew about this man that wanted my place.

He was a relative of Fling, the conductor on

I could not afford to lose my situation, and for

V this reason I “atedirt” more than is natural for

me. _
.'The next day .1 came

"Colonel Pinkerton was at the water tank with

‘into Buckvale on the

his Watch in his hand. He and Fling were on '
"the best of terms; and I know that both of them
«-were anxious to make a place/ for the newcomer.
, But I had the good—wil1 and support of all the en-

gineers, and they knew it was not prudent to dis-
‘harge me without some show of reason.
“You are three minutes behind time, Romsey,”

 the colonel, with a heavy frown on his face.

'.“I thought I was ‘exactly on the moment,” I

_ ventured to reply. . ,_
 (“I say you are three minutes late.”

.; ‘_.‘_Will,you‘ be ‘so kind as to give methe exact
iifne, Colonel Pinkerton? I think your time differs
mom that of the company at.iBilford,” 1 continued.
ver respectfully. . » f  , ~ . p = .
“I have thbiirigaht ti/ma; and it is your dutyto

ave‘ it a1so,”;he «replied, putting  his_‘wa_t»

" and walking away.

But of course I could see that his timefw
three minutes faster tha‘n‘mi_ne. I. . 

As it was, I*was three minutes ahead.ot.-Jghé

train to’ pass it at this station. 

“What time are you, Mr. Fling‘,?” asked. the
conductor, benore we left Bilford the next morn-‘
mg. ' - ‘

consulting his watch; -
' “You are three minutes fast,” I added.

“I am just right,” he persisted, hurrying-away
from me as though he did not wish to have the
diner-ence between our watches investigated. , ‘ -4.

It_seemed to me that he was a party .to, th
pre_s1dent’s plan for getting rid of -me. '1But-
noticed that he gave me the signal to start ‘three
minutes late by his own watch, though by the
right time, according to my own. ' . ' .

“Make all the steam you can,‘ Blunt,” 1"said_,to
the fireman as I pulled out the throttle.- ‘ V

I kept _on all the pressure my_g~auge'wou1d_
allow, and reached my ﬁrst stopping place} ﬁv"
minutes ahead of my own time. -‘ ‘ ’

It was but three miles more to Buckvale, but
Fling did not give the word for me to start —t'
three minutes behind the time by my watch».

I could see no reason_ for this delay, a'n'dvI dog;
think there was any. . ‘ ; . . -, 

I crowded the machine to the utmost’ of_it_s
capacity, for I had an upgrade against me, and
a rather .,heavy train.  J,

I stopped the engine at Buckvale just three and
a half mmutesahead of the true time.  -‘

“‘You are ahead of youritime, and that's worse
than being behind,” growled Co1onel'Pinker. *
evidently disappointed. ‘ , ./ _ 

"I thought -I must be about right by your ti"
sir,” I replied. 

‘fl don’t want any words"about’it,” snappe
he. “There is a lady on this train who has“
take a steamer at Gulport ﬁve minutes after it
due there; if you are late it will be the last tr
you ever run on this road,” continued the colone .
“Now go ahead, and don’t lose another minute
here.” A ' _ . _ "

“I haven’t the conductor’s signal to start"~yét
I remonstrated. , " .

“You have my order! Start your engine}?
roared the president, who was in the worst, hum
possible. , ‘ «A

“But the up train has not arrived yet,.,-rs
I suggested,_appalled at the idea of going 
while the other train was entitled to tl-ieltra-'i:l§.

“Are you the president of this road, or am2]??
demanded the colonel. -

“Certainly I am not the president.” 

— “I am; and every man on the road obeys ‘me,
or he leaves at once.” '   _

At this_moment Fling appeared with his Lw g
in his hand. A  fa

He seemed in doubt, but in a moment rmo,
gave the order to start. ‘ ‘ '

The ‘up train was certainly ..late. ' i

It was usually on the siding when 'I came

‘Time up; will you go ahead,_,Romsey?” de-

_2,nded the conductor, who felt that he was

' “No, sir; I will not!” I answered decidedly.
‘will not cause a collision when I know better.”
i‘Very,well,,Romsey! You are discharged,for

Walker, jump into that cab and run this train

‘ This remark was addressed to the man who had

The magniﬁcent and histori . state coaches
which once formedthe pride of the Pontiffs, a‘

transformed into garages and many imposing
coachmen whose powdered wigs and corpulent ﬁ
ures formerlv drew all eyes, must now turn then‘
hands to ( '.I.er occupations. ' W  ~ 

The transformation began soon after the pre ‘
ent Pope’s elevation to the chair of St. Pete

with a motor car in which the Pbntiif took daily
drives in the Vatican gardens, instead ofnsingftiie
