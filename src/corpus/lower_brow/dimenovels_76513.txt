and the detective had been obliged to leave her in

Nick did not answer Patsy’s remark, but said:
“I have been to headquarters this morning and had
a man sent to Albany to get the extradition papers
for Mrs. Kramer.
“Sowe don’t need to think of her for a day or two.
“Kate Kramer may be in the city now, though I
doubt it. She may also try to pawn the diamond star,
but I doubt. that still more. ,1 think she wants that
gerh for herself.
“But to make perfectly sure, I have had a warning
"V sent to"a”l_t..pawnbrokers to be on the lookout for such
an article, and to notify me the instant any is offered
for a loan. .
“And, of course, I have had the police send an alarm
‘to all stations to look out for Kate Kramer.

r, “The question now is, what shall we do. to ﬁnd her ?”

“She may go to the house where she -lived,’-’ Ida
suggested. A i i g ' ‘ ‘

I “That is what she would “want to do," Nick re-
sponded, ‘fbut I think she will'be too shrewd to do so.”
“She might send a pal,” said Patsy. ‘

“But the rest of the message?‘ Dempsey managed
to get what he had to say in ten words, and the result
is that I can't be sure what he's driving _at.”

Nick looked again at the message.

“You see,” said Patsy, reading over his shoulder. “it

matron was killed by a railway train on the way to
New York,’ or,” and Patsy laughed, “it may mean that
the matron killed a railway train.”

“Nonsense!” exclaimed, Ida.

certain. She murdered the matron and was killed
herself on the way to the city. Isn’t that it, Nick?”

“Pretty near it, I think,” Nick answered. “That
about the train isn’t so clear. I believe it means that
Dempsey is on the way to see us.” ’

He looked at the message once more.

“Ah !" he said, “this was sent twohours ago nearly.
There has been some‘ delay in getting it here.- Well,
we’ll‘wait a bit. If Dempsey is coming he will be
along soon.” i ’ 1

evening. The prisoner was taken to the lock-up and
Ida stayed there until she had been searched.

When the village oﬂicers went to lock the prisoner .

up they found—what they had forgotten to mention to
the New York detective-——that they had no room for
the prisoner.

The village lock-up was a small affair with only
two cells, and the place was so quiet that often weeks
passed without either of the cells being occupied.

On this night, however, it happened that a party of
noisy drunks had been taken in. .

They were sleeping oft’ their jags in the cells, and
 the officers had to find some other place to put Mrs.
 Kramer.

The only place they could think of was the town
poor farm, and they took the prisoner out there.

Mrs. Kramer had made a violent struggle at the
time of her arrest, but she had been very quiet since,
and the village oﬂicers thought she would give no
trouble. ,

The fang and short of it was that the matron #7 the
poor farm agreed to take charge of her through the
 night if the oﬁicers would handcuﬁ the prisoner.

Q .\ This was done, andthey left. The matron locked
 Mrs. Kramer in a chamber and decided to sit up all
 night at the door so as to be sure that the prisoner did

The servant looked in and saw the matron lying on
the floor, dead.

At first sight it looked as if there had been a furious
struggle.

The matron’s head lay in a pool of blood, and there
were bloody marks on the wall and furniture.

Later it proved that the matron had been choked
to death.

“I suppose,” said Dempsey, slowly,‘ and with a
glance at Ida, “that the prisoner cut the matron’s
throat after strangling her. It wasn’t a pretty sight,
and it doesn't make a nice story.”

‘‘Don't mind me, Mr.\Dempsey,’ responded Ida.
“I learned long ago not to mind such things. You
must give every detail just as if no woman was pres-

ent.

He went on to tell of the search that was made as
soon as the: news had been telephoned to the village.

A number of men took part in it.

They found it unexpectedly easy to trace the course
the prisoner took, for she seemed to leave marks of
blood wherever she went.

There was a stain on the wall of the hallway near
her room, and another on the stair banister.

A dark red spot on the knob of the back door showed
how she left the building. '

The men scattered over the poor farm yard and
soon one found a blood stain on a fence.

Evidently the escaping prisoner had climbed the
fence here to get to the road.

It looked probable, also, that she had started toward
the village, and after somelfurther search along the
road another blood stain was found on a stretch of
bare rock >

“Mrs. Kramer,” Nickrernarked at this point, f‘must
have been wounded inthe struggle.”

"“Probably," responded Dempsey, “and we eitpect
to know just how when we ﬁnd her body."

He proceeded to te‘11},hosv the searchers‘ followed the
general direction indicated by the trait of blood until

«they came to the railroad. ' ‘I

There  discovered not‘ only fresh marks of

  of importance. .

  

4 NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

Workmen on the railroad told how the early morn-
ing.Boston express had run into and killed a woman
on a bridge that crossed a tide-water stream not a

‘great .distance east of the Greenwich station.

The woman was crossing the bridge at the time
and the engineer had not seen her until the train was
close upon. her. .

. It,was evident that she made a great effort to get
out of the way. V A

i “It looked,” the engineer had reported, “as if she
tried to drop between the ties of the tressel. She dis-
appeared and the train went on without any shock that

I I I could notice,lbut there's no doubt she was hit.”

Of course, there was no certainty that the woman
run ‘over was Mrs. Kramer—that is, not at (first.

The engineer could not describe her, and he was
the only one who had seen her at all.

The train had been stopped and run back to _the
brid.ss- A ' . .

A search made at that time revealed no trace of the
unfortunate woman. H

It was supposed that her body; had fallen into the

which was running out rapidly.

« So the trainmen reported what they knew at the

station and the train went on. L g
A When the party that was hunting for Mrs. Kramer

 , heard this story, they asked-if the railroad men had

I  hat,     I

“Then I remembered that Miss Jones had told me
how she followed the prisoner from New York, and
that Mrs. Kramer, who left New York bareheaded,
had bought a hat in Portchester.”

“I went over to Portchester and took the hat with
me.

“The stores were only beginning to open up for
the day, but I found a clerk just taking down the
shutters from a milliner’s on Main Street.

“ ‘Ever see this hat before?’ I asked him.”

I “‘]imminy!’ said he, ‘I should say so. \Vhy! I
sold that hat to a woman who came in here bareheaded
last night just as I was shutting up, and here it is
again just as I am opening. And there was another
woman came along last night asking about that hat,
and I told her’ ”

Here Dempsey stopped, for Ida was laughing.

t“That clerk," she explained, “would have kept me
all night with his talk if I had let him.”

. “WelI," responded Dempsey, “he didn’t keep me 

long!” i ,1 let, him saygthat he had told you themay to
a livery stable, and then I broke; away from him. He
was still talkingwhen I left.

did not know that she was bleeding." A

“It's the strangest thing, id the woman, “that

“Could you see her arm at all?”

“No. She had a shawl over her shoulders and it
covered both arms."

Ida wondered a little about this, but it seemed so
certain that the woman was Mrs. Kramer that she
went to the place where she had agreed to meet Patsy
and left the note for him that has been referred to.

Then she took the next train for Bridgeport.

As it happened, Patsy almost caught the same train.

After getting her note he made a bee line for the
railroad station and got there just in time to see the
train disappearing in the distance.

The ﬁrst thing for Ida to do after arrivingiat
Bridgeport was to ﬁnd whether Mrs. Kramer had
come to that city. ., 

She went to the station master and told him on
quiet who she was. '

“I am after a woman,” she said, “who pr
came in on the 7.30 train from the west this mo

“Can you describe her?”

Ida did so.

“I didn't go out to the platform for

They went to the baggage-room and talked -
men employed there. None of them could remem ,
a woman who,kept both hands under a shawl. K
_ “You see," said one, "that train is a local an
doesn't often bring any baggage. It didn't this rnom- .-

"Say!" exclaimed one of the others, “the conductor

“So? where?" asked the station master. ,.

"Oh, somewhere around here. He's not the regu-

It takes great patience, is generally very slow, and
frequently leads to false trails. 1

She asked questions of policemen and storekoepers.
Had they seen such a man as she described between
half-past seven and eiﬁdclock that morning?

In most cases she g information at all; in some
she got information that wasn't worth having.

Now and then she got a point that seemed to be a
clew. ' .

A man who kept a fruit stand was sure he had seen
the woman, and he told which way she went when she
came to the corner just beyond his place.

This was the most promising cle . she had got for
a longtime, the trouble being that 4 around that
next corner had seen such a woman. . i
' Of course, ‘ere was danger in asking so many ques-

» tions of so many different people, but there are times

when that is the 0* thing the best detectives oan do.

At one time Ida suspected that she was being
watched.

A ragged youngster itlled up to where she was talk-
ing with a man and seemed to be listening.

Ida, who saw that the man could give her no point
of value, suddenly said “Tlunk you,” and went on.

She watched the boy narrowly and saw him go down a

He was not a dozen yards away, playing agarne

“I wonder if he was onto me P” she‘ thought a little
anxiously; “It can't be helped. If he has given": tip

he has given it and I can't help it.‘ I've got to take '

chances and lteep at it."  ‘

' She had opened a door and disappeared in a build-
‘ing just as Ida caught sight of her.

But the detective saw how she opened the door.

It wasdone by turning her  half to it and
pushing with her shoulder. . 

“Is it possible?” thought Ida, and immediately she
answered her own question. “Of course it’s possible.
I must find out about it at once." _

In a moment she was at the place where the woman
had disappeared.

It'\\as the -side door to a saloon.

Without any hesitation Ida opened it and went in.

She found herself in ‘dirty back“ room of the saloon.

There were one e— and four chairs there.

At one side was $0: with a slide in it.

The slide was closed. . Q

At the table, facing the street door, ‘sat the woman
who had attracted her attention. ‘ -

She '-was motionless, but Ida felt that her eyes were
‘upon her. ‘

The shawl concealed heﬂmns entirely, and the veil

, hid her face.

It was a villainous face that appeared—but it was
not Mrs. Kramer's.

She glared hatefully at the detective for several
seconds.

“Now what do you think?" _she demanded.

“I still have my doubts,” Ida answered, and laughed
a little.

The woman ‘was terribly enraged.

“I’d like to kill you for your impudence !” she hissed.
“I could do it, too.” .

She had a pitcher in her hand that had been cov-
ered by her shawl.

‘I With a snarl of rage she got suddenly to her feet
and raised the pitcher as if she would strike Ida down
with it.

The detective did not stir.

“Come, come,” said Ida, quietly, “rap for the bar-
tmdef and get your growler ﬁlled. I shan’t inter
fere with ypu.” I

For _a moment the woman stood in her threaten’
attitude. .

Then she lowered the pitcher and went
of the barroom and knocked on the slide. I

“You’ve got nerve,” she said, in a low voi
it saves you this time, but look out! I won’t ans
for your life if I see you spying on me again.”

The bartender opened the slide and the woman _
quickly pulled the veil over her face. V

She put the pitcher on the shelf and the bartender
took it away. '- _

While he was gone the woman did not stir, and
Ida, too, remained motionless.

“Heft y’hX'C," Said IIIC  P1'.¢9°ml}’: 
the pitcher on the shelf. “Have anything, ma’am ?"

This last was to Ida. I

“No,” was the answer,.“I'r_n going out with my

like a  ‘ '

“I won't have any nonsense in here.”
He opened the outside door and the woman stepped
out.
“You, too,” said the- bartender to Ida.
“All right,” she answered cheerfully, and passed
him. \
The woman was walking rapidly, but she turned to
see if Ida were following.
That was exactly what the detective intended to
do.‘and she didn't object to be seen doing it.
Ida had her own ideas about this strange incident.
The woman was not Mrs. Kramer, but the detect-
— ive believed that she had found the straightest clew yet
to Mrs. Kramer's hiding place.
i Seeing that she was followed, the woman shrugged
her shoulders and went on.
Presently she went up the steps of a shabby-look-
house and stopped for a moment at the door.

“Take your row to the street,” said he, angrily. if the raid proved that she was not there and had

not been there, I should be in a worse ﬁx than I am
now. , .

.“The ﬁrst thingpto do is to ﬁnd if Mrs.’ Kramer is
in that house.”  -

The street on which the house stood was not a long
one. I

All of one (side was taken by a factory.

Men and women at this moment were leaving the
factory at the end of their days work. _

The street ‘was stopped at the further end by an-
other factory, and there were no cross streets or alleys
between. Q‘

So the only way to get to 0f  the house was by
coming up to the point where I ood watching.

She I k pains to conceal herself so that ‘she could
look down the length of the street without being seen
from the how’.

Ida did not move from this position until all the
working people from the factory had gone away and
the ‘neighborhood was again quiet.

Meantinae nobody had come from or gone into the

" house she had been watching;

“I shall have to take the chance of a short disap-
pearance," she decided. I

Near her was a tenement house. The front door
was open and several persons had gone in and out while
she stood there. .

Ida went in and passed the stairs to the end of the -I

ground floor hall.
It was dark there, but she needed no light.
’ It was as easy for her to change the appearance of
her clothing as it was for the men detectives.
Her clothes were made for that purpose, and when

Ida came out again nobody would have supposed that ' ‘

she was the same person. » a
Of course, she could not change the appearaneelof
her face. as the ‘men could, but even there she had
made changes-that she believed would save her from
ition in the darkness. of the evening.

“I wonder if she’s'looking for me?”-was the de-
tectives thought.

After a moment the woman’ came back.

She had not been to any store, and she had not
spoken to anybody. It seemed likely, therefore. that
she had been out on a scoutingerrand.

Ida saw her go into the house again.

A few minutes later another woman appeared, com—
ing from the end of the street.

This one also entered the next house and did so, as
Ida could see clearly, without ringing the bell.

Less than a minute after this two women came
down. I I .

They also stopped at the next house, and one of them
rang the bell.

It was impossible to see who met them at the door,
but somebody did and let them in.

“Is it only a boarding house?” queried Ida, “and
are these women just coming in from work in a fac-
tory somewhere?” -

That might be it, and it looked all the more so whet?
still another-w_oman came down and entered alter ring-
ing the bell. ' I

Four who had not been there when Ida first saw
the house had now gone into it, but that was not all.

Another minute passed, and then came two more
women, who rang and were admitted in the same way.

Ida was interested and curious, but she saw no rea-
son to regard the matter as mysterious.

It seemed so, and the smell seemed to grow stronger
I rapidly.
' The thought made her a little anxious——-vnot for her-
self but for her plans.
The house she was in would burn like paper if it
 . . , caught fire, and so would the other houses in the row.

When she opened it she almost coughed, the smoke
was so thick in the hallway.

 A‘lamp was burning on a stand near the second
 ‘stairway and by its light Ida,-saw the colored woman
 standing at the top of the first ﬂight.

The smoke was horribly dense at the top of the
stairs. I ‘

It rolled out in great clouds, for the darky had left
the door open.

Ida put her hand over her mouth and nose and hur-
ried into the room from which it came.

At the further side she could see a dim blaze.

It did not give light enough to see anything else.

She reached out her hand and touched a bed.

From the feeling she could tell that it had been
occupied, but there was nobody there now.

The detective had a terrible fear that the child had
crawled from the bed and lay somewhere on the floor
overcome by the smoke.

Her eyes stung with it and she shut them.

It would choke here to breathe it. I

Still holding her mouth and nose. she got on her
knees and felt with the other hand all about the floor
near the bed.

She found nothing.

Having to breathe, shd hastened back to the stairway
a moment, and then, opening her eyes, saw what
looked like a bundle on the floor of the hall.

Ida picked it up.

It was a: child, unconscious it seemed, although it e

moaned a little when shetstarted downstairs.
At the bottom she met the darky - and another
woman, the landlady as it proved.
“Ah l” cried the latter. “give her to me!"

The detective was only too glad to have the child I A‘

“Have you given the alarm ?” she asked.

"What does that mean?” Ida repeated.

“Why!” stammered the landlady, “the stuff in the
had must have caught ﬁre somehow.”

“Somehow!” echoed Ida, ‘.‘I should say so. Do you
see this?”

She stooped and pointed to a burned match on the
ﬂoor near the hod.

“Yes," answered the landlady, “I shouldn’t won-.
der if my little girl was playing with matches.”

At that moment Idabelieved that she had discovered
and prevented a horrible crime.

She wanted to ask more questions, for it was clear .
that the landlady was tangling herself up) and the de~\
tective was so indignant, that it was all shecould do ‘
to keep from arresting the woman on the spot. ' M

But Ida had to think of other things. :

It was the woman who was probably in the 
house that she must arrest. W

To do that it was necessary for her to conceal her "45
real character from the landlady here. p

So, “I’ll investigate this later," Ida said to‘herself;‘

Somebody, certainly, had been in her room during
her absence upstairs.

It might have been the negress.

Had she been tempted by curiosity to take the note?

It hardly seemed possible, for the darky was busy
and evidently excited all through thevﬁre.

Who then? the landlady? or somebody else who
lived here and who came along just in time?

Ida had seen but three persons in the house: the
landlady, the sick child,.and the negress.

W’ ere there others? '

She was puzzled by these questions for a short mo-
ment. '

Still thinking of them she went to the window and
was about to sit down when she saw a piece of paper
on her chair. *

It was the missing note.~

“Have Iebeen dreaming?” she asked herself; “am
I becominguabsent-minded ?” I
7 She sat down and looked the note over.

It was just what she had written, and she knew
that no one except a Carter detective could make head
or tail of it. ' -

That wasn’t what troubled her.

Ida was in doubt for a moment as to where she had
left the note, when she -went gut‘: ~

If she had left it on the chair, why! then all this
questioning was‘ for nothing,

But Ida-knew that she had~not been dreaming, and
that she was never absent—mi_nded. '

on the table. V I

when her attention was attracted by a slight noise in
her room.

Thinking that the negress or some other person had
come to get her letter, she looked toward the hall door.

Nobody was there, but in that glance Ida saw an-
other’ door opening.

It was the door to the clothes closet of the room.

"She" had opened that door when she first went into
the room and had seen that the closet contained only
a few dresses that belonged to the landlady.

At the moment when’ she caught sight of it now
the door was more than halfopen, and it was still
swinging back.

he lamplight showed a woman standing there.

It was the one whom Ida had met in the saloon.

Her face was more villainous looking than before,
and the ﬂashing of her eyes showed that she was ter-
ribly in earnest,‘

Her riglhtihand was raised, and in it was a revolver
that was pointed straight at Ida.

‘ There are times when even the boldest and quickest

“What l"

It was the first woman who spoke, and she was evt- '
dently startled by the detectives cool remark.

The others were thrown into such doubt that they
glanced at each other inquiringly..

Ida followed up her advantage quickly.

“Do you suppose,” she asked, “that I didn't know _
what I was about when I took a room here? I haven't
worked Bridgeport before, but I knew where to come.”

“Do you mean to say that you are not Ida Jones,
the famous detective?”

“Of course, I do! I’ve been up against Ida before
this, and I ought to know what she looks like. If you
had ever seen her you would know, too.”

“What are you here for, then?"

“I told you. I came to work the town. ,If there
isn’t enough for all of us to do, and you want me
to clear out, you might say so without trying to scar
me to death." ~

“But what did you shadow me into the saloonifor 1'"

Ida had to think fast.

Had they really recognized her?

Should 'she deny that she, had shadowed the woman? I’

Making her decision quickly, she answered:

_ “I was trying to make friends. You wouldn't have
it, and I wasn't going to force myself upon you. \I'
sized you up for one of my kind, andll hit it rig"ht.§s
didn't I?” ' -  V ' _ ’ Q

In all this the detective was watching warily for a.
chance to draw her ‘own weapon. V

But the first woman never lowered hers, and it 
_ I just as certaingas at first that if the detective made a V

falsemove, the revolver would be fired.

“How are we going to know that you’re straight ?’_’j. 
the woman demanded. ‘ 

“You; ought to know already."

"But l1ow.?'’ ‘ ' 

“ByVthis," and Ida held up the note she had written"

the detective. “I feel ﬂattered.”
“We don’t think; we know!" retorted the mur-

‘‘You’ll know more some day,” said Ida, laughingly.

It was her game to make some of the women at
least doubt that she was a detective.

So not once did she admit that she knew what Mrs.
Kramer was talking about.

“You know as well as I do!” cried the murderess,
“for you had me handcuffed last night.”

“Did 1?”

“Well, no,” and Mrs. Kramer was confused for a
moment; “I had forgotten. You left me at the sta-
tion. but you must have known that I was handcuffed
when they locked me up in the poor house.”

As she spoke she waved the bhide back and forth

“Let me ask one question first.” said Ida, hoping to
gain time.

“Be quick. then. for Delia may be back any minute!”

“I want to know about the ﬁre in a coal hod in the
house next door.”

The murderess laughed brutally.

“A fine trick to get you to leave your room,” she
said. “I was sure it was you who hired a room there,
but the others were not so certain. I knew that if you
showed great courage it would be you, and I thought I
)'0ll. might give yourself away by arresting the land-
lady." H

“Did you mean to have the child die from suffoca-

"What did I care for the child? But to answer your
question, no. The landlady laid her on the ﬂoor of the
hall before lighting the fire in the hod. So the child
was safe enough, and the trick worked. for you risked
your life, and I knew it must be you.

“Then we found your cipher note. Of course we V
wouldn't let you send it. and we caught you before you:

“The rest you can guess. I laid for Delia, caught
her, and borrowed her rig.

“Then, after copying her face, I came back with a
squad of police and we wound the thing up."

“You were just in time,” said Ida. .“In another

weren't going to allow me another minute.”

“The Carters are always in time, Ida," Patsy gre-
marked, to which she responded.

“Yes, but I don’t want a closer call than that was.”

was probably worth a good deal more than the one
that had been stolen. They ordered it sent to the

A Ghost Story.
( By Frank _Bowman,.Cleveland_. 0.)

It was night. Slowly the great silvery moon mounted
into the star-studded heavens. A deep silence. a silence
one seemed to‘ feel lay upon the face of the earth. A soli-
tary star shot across the ﬁrmament and disappeared be-
yond. ‘

I was not a very superstitious young fellow at that
time, but thought I: "If there are such things as ghosts

‘ and goblins and imps roaming about this world, which,
of course. is very improbable, to-night would be an ideal
night for them.” And instinctively I glanced hurriedly
about me, half expecting to see an apparition in white
rise from the ground to greet me.

,» _ The morning of this same day I, with Carlo, one of

"my favorites, had started for my uncle‘s farm, which was

- about three miles distant, and I was now returning home.

, My path, a .well—trodden one, led me "through the very
heart of Senobauglfs woods. Here and there patches
of light fell upon the path through the openings in the

. somewhat dense foliage above, making it a very easy
matter to see my way along the path.

1 About halfway .a newlyxerected rail fence crossed the 

path and was lost to view in the gloom beyond. I had
- passed this and had walked a short distance on the other
_ side, when suddenly :17 heard something spring upon
the fence and the next moment the patter of feet upon
my track. In an instant all my previous thoughts of
ghosts‘ and goblins revived  me, and with my heart

. in my very mouth I broke into a mad run- And, oh, how
.1 ran!‘ ,I ran as-one can onl run under -similar circum-
' stances, goadedmn by the wildest fear. ‘But strain as I

reached out my hand and stroked his neck. “Y«,.u rascal,"
said I, “that was a scare you gave me.” Then I looked
at the-single spot of white on his breast and laughed
again. .

On leaving my uncle’s I had not been able to find the
dog, and so had gone without him. But he had returned
not long after I left, and ﬁnding that I had gone started
out after me. His joy at overtaking me had caused him
to leap against me the way he did.

A Messenger’s Fright.
(By Albert Koeppe, Pekin, Ill.)

It was a cold, dark night in January; the snow was
falling fast and thick and a ﬁerce wind was blowing it into
lar e drifts everywherc._

he Cannon Ball Express was late in arriving in the
little town of Cliﬁdale. The express messenger was very
busy sorting his carload of express packages and boxes.
The train crew were rushing here and there, giving and
receiving orders and signals, and ewrything seemed in
Itzmnony with the dark and mysterious night.

It so-happened that on this ‘night the express agent at
this town had a corpse‘ of a man for the express. and as the
car was jammed full, the messenger had to strap the huge . .
coffin-like box on the front platf of the car. The late

» train pulled out and the snow ell very thick over the
-‘body of the dead man.

.-\s it ha pened this messenger was a very superktitious
ti) he dreaded the sight of a corpse, but on this
particular night he forgot completely about the corpse,
until nearly the end of his run. . V _
He at last thought of it. and went to the door. opened
it. and looked out. - VVhat he saw there must have scared
him very much, for he jumped back with a yell" of fright
and terror; ~ ‘
Slamming and bolting theedoor, he ran to the other end
of the car, and ‘yelled for the brakeman. ' The latter came
in and the messenger told him to take alook at the bout

' on the front-platform. A He did. but no sooner didrhe 

eyes on the-boxvvthan he also took to his heels. -_
both went-for theeonduetor. who was a.vcr_v~

-strong.-nerved person.  He asked what was wanted, and

the messenger told him there was a large, white object ‘

pulled vi‘

“When I was put on the case,” replied Harry, “I saw
this nut in the monkey's cage and noticed that the ani-
mal had made no attempt to get at the meat. I became
suspicious, and examined it. The old negress had testified
that her master kept his money in the box with the nuts.
This helped me in making the discovery. The professor
neglected to close the box, and Bijo helped himself after
he had slain his master, discarding this unique money-
banl<‘for another nut when he discovered its spurious char-
acter. If it was Bi'o the robber, why not Bijo the as-
sassin? I acted on we suggestion, and on several occa-
sions proved the correctness of my theory by placing the
revolver in the monkey's way. which he invariably handled
until it was discharged. Thus poor, innocent Bijo was
guilty of a double crime.”

Harry got his reward. and was greatly complimented
for his skillful solving of a difficult problem.

 

The Deacon's Bride.
(By H. H. Woods, Tahlequah, I. T.)',

Everybody in the little town of Fame, I. T., was ex-
cited 10 the limit. for Deacon Raymond, of that town,
who. just six months before, had married, «was dead;
shot, as it was stated, by an assassin, when coming up to
his own gate. .

Every one had his suspicions. but the evidence pointed
to an old darkey. who was arrested. The statement was
that he was seen ‘coming from the spot a few minutes
‘after thehaurder, with a basket under his arm, which the

people supposed contained the weapons, and so he was _

locked up.

Meanwhile. the deacon’s wife. who was a little, child-
like woman, with tender blue eyes, was so overcome with
grief that she was seldom seen out. Just three days
before the trial of the old darkey. Detective Moody, of
Texas, arrived. and set to work on the case.

He was often seen walking about the spot of the mur-
der, mad the house-of the murdered man, but never saying

thought he heard ‘a faint noise near the stairs. He
listened agaiii, but the noise had ceased. He did not hear
anything, but he drew his revolver and ﬁred in the direc-
tion whence the sound came. but he did not hit anything.
as tliev found in the morning.
i'l‘he' boys talked and planned all day, and ﬁnally George
Stillman. the other boy. suggested ‘a plan to catch the
“ghost” that seemed to offer success.
That ‘afternoon_C$eorge went to his home in the village
and procured a large steel trap, which he used on his
various hunting trips. This he took to the old house.
icfore they went to bed that night the boys set the trap
and placed it near the head of the stairs. This done, they
lay down in their blanketsas usual, and were soon asleep.
.\'car the middle of the night they were awakened by
the noise of the trap as it sprang. After lighting the
lantern, they went to examine -the trap. They expected
"to see a‘ man with his foot in the trap, but there was no
man in the trap, nor "ghost." but there was a rabbit. a
'wild rabbit. The boys were so astonished they could
hardly speak. A ’
"Well, I declare," exclaimed George, when he found
his ‘voice, "I thought we would catch. something more
'than a rabbit." Nevertheless they discovered what it
was that-made the noise. '
They got the-reward, and were praised for the cour-
age which they showed in unraveling the mystery.
_ It was a long time before it was found how the rab—
bits made such a rattling noise, but it wasﬁnally discov-
'ered that they got between the walls and climbed up to
the attic. This was what made the noise. A Fi-om'the at-
tic they easily got inside the house.

they spoke in such low tones that the listening detective
did not heara word they uttered. They were about to
go, when “Reddy" said: “Half past twelve to—night, be
sure to be there,” and then the trio of crooks left the
place. “Half-past twelve, be there," laughed the detective
to himself; “well, I will be there."

“Hist, here they come,” said the detective, in low tones,
to his companions. just as a part of the floor of the vault
opened, and a head was popped up. “There is no one
around, boys,” said the owner of the head; “you may come
u .” One after another the men came up, and they were
a ut to open a drawer when the detective gave the signal.
and said: “I'll save you the trouble this time, Mr.

what passed between the two, but failed. The only
words I could distinguish were ‘by bridge of clouds,’ and
immediately a tremulous whistle sounded, and what ap-
peared to be a cloud arose, on which the men quickly
stepped; then they appeared to fade into nothingness,
and the clouds rolled away, leaving me rubbing my eyes
as if in a dream.

“One day, about a week after this strange occurrence.
as I was ﬁshing on a broad bayou, I fancied I heard a
scream. followed by a splash. Paddling near the spot, I
found, by looking through the rushes, my Pedro lashed
to a small raft. while swarming in every direction were
hundreds of scaly alligators. I was horriﬁed, and for a
moment I was nerveless; but, regaining my will power,
I seized the paddle ﬁrmly in hand, and, with a powerful
sweep of my paddle, sent my frail craft fairly hurling
through the water. I approached my comrade with the
speed of the wind, but I could already see that I would
be too’ late, for when I was but two-thirds of the way
there, one monster, more rapacious than the other, seized
him by the arm. and had started for the bottom of the
bay, with the others in full pursuit. Pedro saw me, and
with an agonizing scream, turned his bloodshot eyes
toward me. and sank forever beneath the muddy waters
of Tampa Bay.

“Pedro’s murderers decamped the next day.

“The bridge of clouds was a huge sheet of canvas,
cleverly contrived so that it could roll up or unfold like
an immense curtain; thus giving the appearance of a
large white cloud when viewed from a distance at night.
This explains how .I had lost their trail; but the strange
part of the mystery was that, the next day, I found my
poor Pedro‘s clothes, his money and his old silver watch.
The watch was still going, and his clothes were not cut
or torn in any manner. Now. how could this be, when
I plainly saw them on his body when he was seized by
the alligator? Why was Pedro put to death, and I not
even molested? How did the gang disappear so quickly,
and whowere they? These are the parts of this great
mystery that for -forty years have remained unsolved.

%‘h¢e two friends were in the neighborhood of sixteen
yearsoiageatthetimelaxnwriting I. Th
were inseparable chums, and though often into mischie ,
were not bad boys. « .

The subject that occu ‘ed their thoughts was the as-

about nine o'clock in the evening. On’ be‘! way home

tore 08 two valuable rings that she ware. and, without
a word, the villain bounded away into the darkness.

As-soon as she dared, Edith got up and ran home.
Between her sobs, she told her parents what had hap-
pened, then fell to the ﬂoor in a swoon.

The matter was put in the hands of the police. An in-
vestigation followed, but'it was of no avail, and the af-
fair was seemingly forgotten.

Carl and Roy had not forgotten, and, as I said before,
they were talking the matter over, some three weeks
afterward. They both agreed that if they wished the
villain brought to justice, they must do it themselves.
Finally, they agreed upon a plan, and to meet at Carl's
home at seven o’clock that night.

At seven o’clock Roy rang the bell, and Carl, going
to the door, took his friend up to his room. There they
began to.dress themselves in girls clothes, and, after
muchlaughing and lacing, they presented the appearance
of two ‘young’ ladies, going out for a walk.

Placing’loaded revolvers in their dresses, where they
could uickly get them, they slipped downstairs and out
the ba door. ,

Arriving on the street, they proceeded to the scene of
Edith_’s assault. They passed slowly along the street
where the assault took place.

When they were about halfway through, Roy whis-
pered: "See that shadow skulking close to the wall?"
Carl said nothing, and the pair walked.along. Suddenly
a dark form bounded toward the nearest boy.

“Look out, Roy!” cried Carl. Of course, that gave
them away. The villain, hearing that, started to run,

‘ fbut Carl. was right after,him. When about four feet
behindhim, Carl, who was a good football player, made

a headlong dive, and, tackling the man around the legs,
brou ht ‘him to the ground.

T ! en the ruiiﬁan began to ﬁght, and Carl would have
fared badly had not Roy run up. and. covering the villain
“Keep still there, or I'll blow
your head off.” This quieted the man, who had no no-
tion of {stopping a bullet with his head. _. .

The boys then ordered him to get up, and, with their
revolvers in their hands, drove him all the way to the
policejstation. '

‘ The. slugger was tried, and he confessed gt» a number
of assa’ults,‘and» was given a heavy sentence .to serve.

It ‘is needless, to say that the two boys were heroes
for some time. and Edith thinks more of Roy than before,
 was not. a little. T

ference of Randall, who ﬁrst asked to see the ten—dollar
bill that was recovered.

“just what I suspected,” he cried; for, upon looking
at the bill, the imprint of a row of teeth could be seen,
and upon examining Griﬁin’s box it was found that a
ground-mole had bitten into the box and taken the money.
The money was found in the mole’s hole under Wilke’s
house. ' '

 

An Unsolved Mystery.
(By Joseph Gorzalez, Tampa, Fla.)

Mr. VVhite was returning from town, and as he turned
a bend in the road, somebody in the bushes discharged
a double—barrelled shotgun at him. The bullet went
right through the back of his buggy and through his
body.’ The horse got frightened, and ran away, and
never stopped till he got to his own door. The man's
wife came to the door and found him sitting in the buggy
unconscious. Her screams aroused the neighborhood,
and a doctor was soon brought. 'Mr. VVhite, before he
died, told where he was shot at. The neighbors searched
and found a double-barrelled shotgun; and a walking-
stick in the bushes. They tried to trace the murderer.
but on account of the dense growth of palmettocs, they
could ﬁnd no trail, and the mystery has never been
solved yet. This happened a couple of years ago.
. Two men have been arrested on suspicion, but as
nothing could be proved against them, they were re-

leased. .
