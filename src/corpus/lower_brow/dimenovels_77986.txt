that this outlaw had known his father, and could tell?

,It was in perfecting theseaarrangements that the
knowledge of the Indian chief, Gray Feather, was par—)
ticularly advantageous to them, for he knew distances
._ and locations by instinct, when he did not know them
as the result of observation, and to the white man he
was enabled to explain fully the dﬁfection and the trails
ithey inust follow in order to obtain the position they

wished to occupy. '
Chick and his party went directly back through the
 trailby which the prisoner had been brought into camp,
and at the edge of the open glade, where Chick had
‘encountered the Indian on his return, they halted, while
i « the young detective, with“Thornshill and two others, crept
, forward as silently as shadows toward the fringe of
bushes_ which surrounded the entrance to‘ the cavernous

4 1 passageway at the oppositelsidel of the depression.
 v Although they stopped frequently to listen, and at not
time made any sound which could have been heard, ﬁfty
feet away, they were aware of nothing to interfere‘ with

~a.."«"~' -

“their progress as they approached, and the result was
‘ . ; that presently Chick led~them past the bushes and «on
L into the tunnel, until at last they patised before the barred

V attacking—party. We must not forget that ﬁve men had
b_e_e_r1:left3 behind to guard Kid Curry, and that two more
had. been sent back with Arizona. A

Nevertheless,‘ the men; under the command of the
young assistant to Nick Carter possessed two advantages

‘ which were not to be despised. They consisted in the
facts that the attack was a complete surprise, and that
it was made from twtfsides at once. i

There was another advantage, also, which counted
for s,om’ething———the outlawsihzid no idea of the number

‘ that had been brought against them. ‘They might have

been =outnumbe‘red from lbo"th\ sides, and, indeed, the

yelling and ﬁring and shouting and other noises made by
« V the cow-punchers, when they rushed forward in the early

casually propounded as not to excite any‘ surprise or even

.. .curiosity as to my motive, I learned at different times,

from different parties, what I will now condense ‘intoa

few words. , _

,: f ,‘ The man’s name was Asa Slingsby. He was about
‘forty-ﬁve years of age; He lived between three‘ and
four miles from the village, on a farm of his own on a
back country road. He was well to do, and had within
f the last few years inherited a handsome sum of money.

 I”  He 'was,a widower, without children, and since h'rs”wife’s

 death, in 1872, he had lived alone, working a small ‘por-‘

 tion of ‘his farmrhirnself, and renting out the rest. He
 was not generally well liked, though he could make
it t , himself very agreeable when he chose. He was greedy
and miserly, was very fond of money, and always ready
to drive a hard bargain, It was thought he would sell
