and the galley-house nearly hid the two men from
view.

One of these two was a man servant in the cook’s
employ. _

’By that is meant here _not,a regular member of
the crew, but a poor man who was working .his pas-
sage. " ,_

His name was John Foster.
He had come into Jacksonville the day before the

‘ steamer sailed and begged the captain to give ‘him
' some kind of work, so that he might get to his home

in the North.

Foster admitted that he wasnot a sailor, but he
said he was willing to do any kind of work, shovel
coal, scrub the decks, or wash dishes.

“I’m willing to sleep on a coil of rope and eat the
‘leavings,” he said.

The captain was a kind-hearted man, and, thought

he had all the crew he needed, he asked Foster how
it happened that he was in such hard luck.

- Foster told him some of his troubles, and the cap-

tain immediately decided to help Him to go to the
North, where he had lived until a few months he-

, fore.

There was really little for him to do, but he was so
anxious to work that he was kept busy in the cook’s
galley. ‘T , _

‘He peeled potatoes, scrubbed pans, mopped the

door, _brougl_1t up coal. washed dishes, and never

complained when other men put extra work on him.

;It was John, Foster who was addressed and struck
 stated above. V

.. .,  The others looked around. a r .    

The first he knew was when he got the blow on
the head that caused him to stagger nearly" to the
open deck abaft the house. '

He heard the words:

“You’ll never live to tell your story!”

They came at the same time with the blow which
blinded him, and, when he tried to turn and defend
himself, he was so dazed that he could not see his
enemy.

The pail had dropped from his hand and fallen
into the water.

At the very instant when the blow came the cap-
tain of the Moccasin pulled the whistle cord to give a
salute to the passing steamer.

The noise of the whistle drowned the scufﬂing of

‘the men.

When the three blasts on the whistle were over,,
the scufﬂing had ceased. A

And at that time there was only one man instead of
two on the deck by the galley gangway.

That man was the cabin passenger.

He had followed up his ﬁrst blow with another,
given while Foster was still staggering.

Then he had lifted the half—unconscious man in
his arms and dropped him over the rail.

Foster had tried to struggle; he tried to cry for

' help; but the passenger clapped a hand over ‘his
mouth to stifle a cry, and the blows had taken his ,

strength and will p’ower from him. _
The passenger gave one glance over the rail. (
He saw Foster sink beneath the surface like so
much iron. 4 ii

‘- ~ Nobody had seen him since they couldn’t tell

_- ;He did his work so quietly that they seldom paid
any attention to him. I I
‘T ' _It was only when they ‘wanted Foster to do some-
"thing that they thought of him.

“Great Scott! what’s the matter?” asked one of
his companions, in a half—whisper.

The leader pointed.

“I’ve got ’em,” he stammered, “or I saw a dead
man in there!”

Just then the schooner made a quick turn into the
wind.

Most of the young men were thrown to the deck.

They scrambled up half-laughing, half-frightened,
and demanded of the skipper to know what he meant.
V The skipper’s face was grim.

“There’s a man out there,” he answered, shortly;
“I seed him driftin’ past.”

He gave orders to the one man who served as his
crew, and that man, got forward with a boathook.

“There he is!" he cried, a moment later.

The young men, now sobered, gathered at the
side.

The man forward caught at the ﬂoating body with
his hook, and the passengers pulled him aboard.

“He isn’t dead!" cried one.

Another hastened to the cabin and brought outa
bottle of whisky. ' _ '

“What luck!” exclaimed one, “that we didn’t drink
it all 1”

A dose’ of the hot stuff was forced into Foster’s
mouth, and the young fellows went to rubbing him
violently. '

‘ “Turn him upside down!” yelled the skipper, fro.m
his place at the wheel. } H '

T They started to obey, but _Foster was not suffering ~
from drowning; he had taken in very‘ little water‘.
' _ The -trouble with him was that he had been struck

 .V\’ith this, the skipper took of? his hat and passed

“It’s pretty late,” he remarked; “better not bother
the detective till morning.”

“I s‘han’t sleep,” replied Foster, stubbornly, “until
I’ve seen him.” ,

And so it came about that there was a ring at
Nick’s bell almost at the moment when Sunday was
going out, and’ Monday was coming in.

CHAPTER II.

-1-‘osrr.R’s HARD LUCK.

It happened luckily for john Foster that Nick
Carter was at home. '

All others in the house were asleep, but the great
detective was in his ‘library, interested ill a book.

_He heard the bell, and went down himself to

answer it.

A poorly-dressed stranger was on the step.

_He started a bit when Nick pressed 3. button that"
suddenly threw his face into at glare of light.

“Does Mr. Carter live here?” the man asked, in a
trembling voice.

“Which Carter, my friend?”

‘_‘Nicholas Carter, the detective."

“i am he.”

Foster, for it was he, stared, speechless for a mo-
ment. V ' V

Then he‘ caught Nick by the sleeve.

“For God’s'sake, sir,” he said, hoarsely, “will you
hear my story ?”V '

Nick looked calmly at his visitor. ‘He noticed the
wild eyes, the man's excitement, and he half-sus-
pected that the‘ man was an escaped lunatic.

But the man’s distress was eviden-tlyvreal, and.
even. if he were a lunatic, it would be wise to talk
with ‘him, and, meantime, send quietly to‘ Beflevue‘ —
for pliysicians to take chargeof him. i i '

So, “Come in,” said the detective.

l “I ca.n’t pay you a cent. I’m a beggar! All I’ve

deal better than nothing.” i

Foster sighed bitterly. .

“I suppose,” suggested the detective, ”-that you
were induced to invest in something that didn’t turn
out well.”

“Yes, sir; that was it. That’s the story, but,~if it
was only a case of putting money into a business that
didn’t pay, I wouldn’t bother you to hear about it.

“I was swindled, Mr. Carter, awfully swindled, 
and, if something isn’t done, other foolish farmers R 
will be caught in the same trap.” . V V

He took some water-soaked papers from his
pocket  handed them to Nick. ‘

“I' guess you ‘can’ read them,” he said. “They
were in my elotheswhen I was thrown into the bay,
and of course they got pretty wet, but I think you’
can make out what they say.”

Nick glanced at the papers.

bought the land, and that it was no longer any of his
business.”

“Are you sure that Preble had the right to sell

“In one sense it doesn’t, but in another it's dif-

Foster started up with a groan of despair.
“Then nothing can be done!" he cried.

“Like enough,” responded Nick, smiling, “but he
paid some attention to it as it was. I am Carter."

“Good‘Lord!” cried the captain. holding out his
hand. "‘I’m proud to meet you. But tell-me about
Foster. Have you‘ seen him?”

“Yes, last night.”

“All! then that accounts for it. He slipped ashore
as soon as we got to the dock."

“No; you are mistaken. He was thrown into the
bay by one of your passengers.”

The captain was amazed.

“I suppose you know what you're talking about."
he said, slowly, “and that may account for the way
the cook missed him.”

“How was that?”

The captain told how he had inquired at the cooks
galley an hour before for Foster, and how the cook
said nobody had seen him since some time last even-
ing. I -
“They supposed he had struck work and joined the
passengers,” said the captain, “but I thought it
strange that he should leave the ship without speak-
ing to me.” i

“Did you have a passenger named Taylor?”

“I think not, but I'll see."

He sent for the purser, who brought a list of the
cabin passengers.

The name Taylor did not appear on it.

“Take a pencil,” said Nick, “and put a mark
against the names ’of all the passengers with whom
you are acquainted.” L ‘

The captain did.so. Not counting women and
children, there were the names of eight men who, he
said, were strangers to him.

Nick then asked the captain to tell him about each
one of the men passengers whom he did know.-

In this way the (detective became satisﬁed that the
would-be murderer was not one of those known to
the captain. , ,— . -

“He was one of those eight,” said Nick. ‘‘I must I

ﬁnd out what became of each one of them.”
/He copied the names, and then‘ went down to

Staten. Island, where he found the skipper who had.

- From him the detective learned enough to show’

that Foster hadospokcn the truth in everything.’

Nick explained that the nescued man could use“ .

skipper said wasn’t necessary anyway, and then the
detective went back home.

He gave the list of eight names to Patsy, and told
him to trace them, first getting as good a descrip-
tion as Foster could give of Taylor, Preblc’s partner.

To Chick he said:

"You must keep this man under guard until you
hear from me. It won’t be safe for him to go out
alone. I shall probably start for Florida to~night.”

' Patsy returned at the end. of the aiternooh.

With the list of names _in his hand, he reported:

“Wilson went in a cab from the steamer to the
Grand Central station and took a train for Buffalo.

“Johnson went to the Fifth Avenue Hotel,'and is
tliere now. He’s a rich man, who lives [in Chicagof

“Mortimer is a New Yorker. He lives on West
Seventy-second street, and he went home. To—day
he has been at his business place.

“Richards, I’m not dead sure. about him, but I
think he started south‘ on the midnight train from

it  _ the Pennsylvania station.”

l‘That’s interesting,” interrupted Nick. “A man
travels up from the South by boat and starts back
again before he’s been four hours on land. How
did you get onto it, Patsy?”

,“I learned at the dock,” replied the young detect-
ive; “that the baggage of one passenger was sent for

“Then he must believe that he succeeded in kill-
ing me.”

“-Possibly, but he may be afraid of being captured. '

Perhaps he saw the schooner pick you up.”

When Nick had -heard the rest of Patsy’s report he-

was more certain than ever that Foster’s enemy had
started back for the South on the same night that he
arrived in New York.

He gave various instructions to his assistants, got
all the information he could from Foster, and ad-
vised him to stay where he was until it was cer-
tain that he could go about without danger.

Then Nick started tor Florida. '

As he wished to lose no time, he went by rail..

He did not go straight to Palm Beach. but in-
stead looked up Foster’s wife and child before doing
anything else.

Nick did not tell Mrs. Foster who he was, but he
said that he was a friend of her husband’,Ks_. and gave
her some money, as if it came from him.

“I wouldn’t say anything about this,” he can-
tioned her, “for Preble might hear of it. and if he did
he might give you trouble."

Mrs. Foster promised to keep quiet, and told Nick
the way to the swamp that her husband had been in-
duced to buy. '

The detective took a short look at it. I

“No wonder Foster was discouraged,” he thought.
“There are thousands of acres there that never can
be of use to anybody.”

His next call was at the county clerk's oﬂicc.
where he asked who owned the swamp lands.

“Well,” replied the clerk, “most of that land
stands in the nafne of Guy Preble, but I believe he’s
transferred a good part of it to a company.” 

“ Ah! who is Preble ?”

“We only know that he’s a Northern capitalist.”
~ “Indeed! then he hasn’t owned the swamp very
long?” i _

“Oh, no; not more than two years. He bought it
for next to nothing, for it isn’t worth anything. I
understand that {rethinks of draining it somehow.”

“What about this company?" ‘

“I idon’t*k'r,I.0W except what he has said. *He says I

he has got a number of Northern people interested

in it. Some-of them have bought parts of the

swamp.” '-

.'iThe clerk hesitated.
_ “I, don’t know that I ought to say anything,” he
‘ answered,’ “for it’s none of my business, but the fact
is.that there» have been a number; of men here to
complain that they’ve been swindled.  But we can't
fdo anything for them. I’m afraid there's been dis-
honest work, but, you see, Preble seems to be
straight. He owned the land, and he sold it. What
can we do about it?” E
“Nothing. He hasn’t sold it all, has he P”
“Oh, no! A good three—quarters of it is still in
. his possession.” a
That was all Nick wanted to know.‘ He had no
doubt that in time Preble would try to sell the rest
of his worthless swamp to unsuspecting farmers, and
he made up his mind to prevent -him from doing so
if possible. ~ ‘

At that the one with the knife turned upon him,
and again aimed a blow.

But by that time Nick was on the spot.

He struck the upper man a stinging blow that sent
him staggering along the road.

At the same instant the detective caught the man's
knife hand, twisted the wrist and caused him, with a
snarl of pain, to let go of the weapon.

It fell to the ground. ‘

Then Nick found himself in trouble for a mo- '

'ment.
The other man had got to his feet and was com-

ing at him.
He" had some kind of a weapon raised.
“Steady, neighbor!" exclaimed the detective,

grappling him so that he could not move.

, It was well that he did so, for it proved that the
man had a loaded revolver, and in another half—sec-
ond he would have ﬁred it straight in the detectives
face.

“Let me alone, curse you!" grunted the man, try-
ing to bring the muzzle of his weapon against Nick’s
breast. _

Nick forced him to his knees, and then wrenched
the revolver away from him. i
‘ “You don’t seem to think very well of me for
saving you from being stabbed to death,” remarked
Nick.

“W'hat’s that?” demanded the other, panting;
“ain’t you one of Preble’s heelers ?”_

The mention of that name gave Nick a new in-
terest in the affair. '

' Butjthere was something else
“Wait,” said he; “listen !” .
He was still holding the man on his knees.

' Both were quiet for a moment.

They heard a sound of breaking twigs and hur-
ried footfalls in the direction of the forest.

The sounds grew fainter and fainter.

\ “The infernal redskin’s got away,” muttered the

man.
“Penola ?” asked Nick.

“Make your bets,” called the croupier, as be pre-
pared to spin the marble again.
Some of the players had won and some had lost.
At this call money _and chips rained on the board.
Preble, for Nick was now certain that it was he,
hesitated a little, and then placed half of what he had
left so that his bet “straddled” 23 and 26.
The marble began to'whir.
Somebody reached over and -laid a single chip on
the zero. ‘
Another pushed a t\venty—dollar bill on the square
marked “Even.”
The marble began to jump.
“Nothing more goes,” called the croupier.
Just at that instant Preble placed the rest of his
chips on the square marked “Black.”

The croupier's voice rose above the remarks of

‘happened, for all could see where the marble landed.
“Fourteen, black, second dozen, middle column.”
The chips that Preble had placed on the 23-26
were raked in, but the same amount was pushed up
beside those he had placed on the black.
“Stand-off," he mut'tered.l
He had lost one bet and won another. .
“You ought to have put them all on the black,"
said Dick.
“Rats!” reto‘rted Preble; “why didn't you tell me
to put them on the fourteen?”
Dick turned about and walked away.

chips, amounting to about ﬁfty dollars, on the third
dozen. ‘

He was following the detective’s play, but he fol-
lowed wrong, for the marble stopped in the slot
marked two. ’ L ’

Nick lost the bet he had placed on the third dozen,
but won even money on the color. '

Preble lost all he had in sight.

“I ought to have divided," he muttered, discon-
tentedly. .

Nick heard him. i e

“I’ll make him lose if Iican,” he thought, as he
saw Preble diving into his pocket for more money.

- So, instead of dividing his chips at the next turn,
Nick put them all, amounting to three hundred dd-
lars, on the black. ‘ ‘

That color had just come up.

It was probable, ‘therefore, that red would come i‘

up next, and Nick wanted to lose.

If he lost that bet it would have cost him nothing
to play, for he still had the silver dollar with which « " 
he began. ' ;.

Preble took out a roll of big bills. A 

From them he selected a century, and reached
out his hand as if he meant to follow the detective’ L
again. ‘ it i ‘

cards were being shuffled. “Taylor will lose stead- ,

will be allowed to win for a while, and then they’ll

had lost what he started with.

The latter bought another thousand dollars of 

chips.
Before beginning the third deal Preble struck a
bell. .

In answer to it a young Indian came in. ,

“Let’s have whisky, Penola,” said Preble.

The Indian brought a bottle, and poured a glass
for each i man. i

“Here's how,’ said Preble, draining his glass at a
single gulp. T A

“How,” responded Taylor, doing likewise.

cuﬁof -Preble’s coat sleeve, and into the table.

draw blood. ‘ i V.

pinned to the place where it lay. ' ,

The game was at an end at that table for the day.

For it is a rule ‘of the place that when the bank
has been broken there shall be no more play at the
unlucky table until the next day. s

’Nick watched the scene with the greatest interest;

He had witnessed heavy gambling before, but
nothing quite as striking as this richly-dressed old
woman, who played and won as if the result meant

Indthingto her. ,

“She's as cold-blooded as they make them,”

ltheught Nick.

But he was equally interested in Preble and Tay-
lor, over whpm he kept the sharpest watch.
» The Swindlers stood at the table until Countess
Telka had been paid.

It ended at a grove.

Looking through ‘the partly opened door, Nick
saw that the countess had left her window wide open.

Her heavy breathing assured him that she was
sound asleep. M

Another long hour passed.

The detective kept his eyes ﬁxed upon the win-
dow.

It was almost perfectly dark in the chamber, and
it was but little lighter outside.

At last, without any sound whatever, he saw a
dark spot appear on the space just above the win-
dow—sill. ’

_It was a man's head.

The detective could distinguish nothing more

than the outline, but he could see that the man had
-no hat on.

“One of them," he thoug'ht, “is on the other’s

shoulders. I hope it's Preble who is going to climb
info the room.”

If that should prove to be the case, Nick's work
would be ﬁnished quickly and easily.

Preble would be caught in the act of robbery.»

That would mean a long term in prison. .
And that would stop the swindling operations, for
it was very clear that Preble was the leader, and that
Taylor could not do much, if anything, without him.
For a full minute the head stayed where it was,‘
perfectly motionless.

Then -it roseslowly, the shoulders cameinto view, ‘

and hands were laid on the window-sill. .

The countess islepton, and there was no reason
why -‘she should not, for the robber made no noise.

“Safe! safe!” she starnrnered over and over.

There were liiirried footsteps in the hall, and a
knock at the door of the countess.

“What is the trouble?” asked a voice.

countess. “Wait a moment.” ‘

She hurriedly threw on a wrapper, and let the

At an early hour that morning, a desk and some
chairs were put into the ofﬁce mentioned in the ad-
vertisement, and a sign painter called and put the
words, “Florida Land," on the door.

All this was done before ten o'clock, at which time
Mr. Wellman came in. and was ready for business.

Nobody called on him till after noon.

Then a farmer arrived who said he'd seen what
was said in the paper and guessed he’d look into the '
thing.‘

"I am sorry,” responded Mr. Wellman, “that I
can’t give you any .more information just now.
You see,,I’ve only begun business to-day and my
maps have been delayed somewhere on the railroad.
Call again next week.”

The farmer said he would do so, and went away.

Three or four others called and got the same sort
of answer to their questions.

A little after three o'clock, however, a man came
in with whom Mr. \\'ellman was more willing to talk.

“I understand," said the caller, “that you are deal-
ing in Florida lands."

“Yes,” replied_‘Mr. W'ellman.

“\’Vhere are they P"

“In Florida."

The caller smiled. ’

“Of course,” he said; “I didn't suppose they were
in Texas. lwhat part of the State ?""' ‘ 

“My maps haven't arrived, or I would show you.‘
‘ Can't you come in again to-morrow ?”

“Perhaps‘,'but I say, Mr. Wellman, I think you’ve

“Not till now.”
“You really thought I was a land swindler, did
you?”
“I may as well admit it, now that the game’s up,”
replied Preble. “I thought you'd got into the kind

of game I was working and that it would be safer if .

there was only me in it. Penola was sure he could

Both Preble and t In-
dian were put in prison for life.

It came out that way.

Taylor could not be found at that time, but Nick .

didnot worry about him, as Preble was the important
man. It happened, though, that the detective ran
across Taylor at another time, the circumstances of
which will be told in another number of this weekly.

Nearly a thousand dollars in cash were found upon
Preble. -The court decided that this money could

his path was strewn with eggs. Every few steps would
But he did
not have long to tell his troubles. He was hustled out-
side and bundled into the carriage which was to carry
them to the party.

After about twenty minutes‘ ride they arrived there.

They were admitted by a solemn-looking servant
clothed in a black suit of clothes. Of course Silas at
once thought him the master of the house. He went up
to him, grasped his hand and began giving it an old-
time shake.

“How de do, Mr. Gould?”
the master of the house.) .

“Eh?" gasped the servant. “I'm not Mr. Gould. I’m
the servant.”

Silas said not another word, but moved away. The
people he had come with had gone upstairs, but Silas
did not know that. He began to aimlessly wander about
the lower ﬂoor. By some accident he got into the
kitchen. When Mary the cook caught sight of him she
began to laugh.

“Arrah, it looks like a monkey. Phfat is it yer after,
Mr. Monkey?” ,

“I—-I came to the party, and I'm lookin’ for the
pee le.”

e cook's manner toward him changed instantly.

"Axcuse me, sorr, but I thought ye war a tramp.
Walter, show the gint «to the rayciption room.”

“Och, yaw, but naype you get a carriage.”

Walter was a very fat German employed as gardener
and was averse to any kind of work. This leading Silas
to the people did not please him, for he would have to
walk upstairs—a most dreadful job.

It took him a long time to get up, but it was lucky
for Silas that the progress was not rapid, for his shoes
pinched awfully. '

Now they were at the doorway; which was covered
with curtains. A large fur rug lay on the ﬂoor.

’l‘lie German had left Silas and waddled downstairs.

Silas did not know how to make a polite entrance.

In some manner his feet got tangled in the rug. He
lost his balance and felt himself falling. He grabbed the
curtains and they came down with him. He landed in a
Eoxlilfused heap, his head in the room and his feet in the

Iiuekily for Silas, there was nobody in the room at
the time, except-an old servant, who helped him to his
feet. The servant was laughing loudly when the host
suddenly entered. the room.

He stopped instantly. . V

" Phfat’s yer name?" he whispered to Silas.

Silas told him. ' .

bowed to Mr. Gould. “

over and introduced him to his daughter and son.
Silas, when introduced, shook hands with Mr. Gould’s
son. He gripped so hard that the son had to ask him
to let up. Needless to say, nobody else offered to shake
hands with Silas that evening. v
Silas eluded everybody for about an hour. Then he
’ was cornered by Mr. Gould's daughter Margaret. Now
Silas was decidedly nervous. He knew that if she once
gotgoing as most girls do she would never stop.

“Oh, Mr. Cfurnper, will you tell me something about
your home? Charles Dudley Warner once lived, or,
rather, was born there, and I'm naturally inquisitive
about the place. I kno-A: you do not live in Pittstield,
but you live about five miles west of it. So.yon must

. have visited it. By the way, were you acquainted with
Mr Warner?" ‘

"Wal, I thinks I onghter know him I gets all my
horse: shoed over to his place."

Margaret began to laugh.

“Oh, I dou’t think you understand who I mean. The
person to whom I referred to is Mr. Warner, the writer.
Have you ever read ‘My Summer in a Garden,‘ Mr.
Crurnper?” . . ‘

“\\='l_iat!” exclaimed Silas, “you writin’ books
a'ready ?” —

This was too much for Margaret, who was naturally
full of fun. She let all her penbup laughter come out.
Of course. Silas now knew that he had made some blun-
der. He moved uneasily in his chair, and Margaret,
noticing this, dqoped laughing ' .

“Oh. Mr. Crumper, you did not understand me. ‘My
Summer in a Garden’ was written by Mr. Warner. But
a person  easily misinterpret that. Well, I see you
are not acquainted with Warner, auwe’ll let him rest for
this evening. ‘Are you acquaintéd with any great com-

Nobody in the room. He went to the piano and began
to play. Gradually, after playing it six or seven times
he became so absorbed in it that he did not notice the
folks who came in one by one. After the eighth time he

Silas got up bewildered and retreated to a corner of the

The Monkey and the Parrot.
(By Will L. Johnson, Y.)

Once a man named Jones kept a grocery and general
store in a small town, and had two pets, a nionkey-Mr.
Sims, they called hiin-and a parrot.

They were both as mischievous as old Nick himself,
and one day the man was called away on business, lock-
ing the store and leaving Mr. Sims and the parrot alone.
Somehow, the monkey got loose from his cage, and
opened }:oll_v’s door, pulled her out and proceeded to
have a‘ lively time. First he pulled the plug out of the
rnolasses barrel, and opened the kerosene can and let
both mixtures run all over the floor.

Well, “Mr. Sims” and polly got in a lively scrap and
smashed things in general. A lamp was overturned,
the monkey rubbed oily into the lcercsene and molasses.
receiving a "share 0 it himself. The monkey lost half
of his tail, the parrot’s feathers were all gone, and the
two were the most comical specimens that-any one ever
saw.

I Mr. Jones then came in, and seeing the disorder,
stopped in the doorway, and stared. Polly was perched
on the top of the cotlee grinder, and Mr. Sims had his
head in the cracker-barrel, chattering Pike a magpie,

“ Well," said polly, “what do you think of it? We've
been having a devil of a time since you were gone
away."

Mr. Jones sat down in a basket of eggs and roared A

At a house out in the country the Methodists were
holding prayer—meeting. The people that lived in the
house always took strangers. The Dutchman called in
and was received with welcome.

An old man began to pray, and the rest of the people
began to groan, and go on as they always do.

The Dutchman did notknow what to do, but he knelt.

The man next him began to groan and say “amen,"
so the Dutchman said to the man:

“Is yer vife sick?”

The man-shook his head.

“Vell, is,der baby sick?”

The man shook his head.

“Veil, den, is yer sick yerself?”

“No,"said the man, “we are Methodists, and it’s our
custom to groan and--—~—"

With this the Dutchman jumped up and ran out of the
house.

_ A Schoolboy’s Composition on Corns.
(By Louis Herzog, Md.)

Corns are of two kinds—vegetable and animal. Vege-
table corn grows on rows and animal corn grows on toes.
There are several kinds of cows: There is the unicorn,
the capricorn, popcorn, eorudodgers, ﬁeld corn and the
corn which is the corn yourfeet feel most.

Corns have kernels, and some colonels have corns.
Vegetable corn grows on the ears, but the animal corn
grows on the feet at the other end of the body. Another
kind of corn is the acorn. This grows on oaks. The

« acorn is the corn with an indeﬁnite article added. Try

it and see. Many a man when he has room wishes it
was an acorn.

Folks that have corns sometimes send for the-doctor,
and if the doctor is corned himself he probably won't do
as well as if he isn‘t. The doctor says that cornsare
produced by tight boots and shoes, which is probably
the ressonwben a man is tight they say he is corned.

You show good sense, Arthur. in your letter. You
did very well in your attempt to solve the mystery.

Try again sometime.

Here is another good letter:

Eorron Ntcu CARTER Wnns:1.v——

Dear Sir: In reading the story of “Nick Carter's
Ocean Chase" I was interested very much in my guesses
as to who the thief was. At first I had a little suspicion
of the Roumelian minister himself, but as I read on I
began to form an unfavorable im ression of Palog.

Wlxen he told how be procured) the diamond I began
to think hard.

“That man," I said to myself, ‘,‘is evidently bad at
heart, He stole the diamond from thepoor natives.
What was to hinder him from stealing thcdiaznond from
his government?” -

Of course there was no proof. but stillzl had a lurking
suspicion of him. The only foundation for my suspi-
cion was the knowledge that Palog was dishonest.

As the story showed, I was right in my suspicion.
Do you not consider that I did good detective work?
< Yours truly,

Springﬁeld, Ohio. I?oANKwxr.L Russet.

In that case you were right, Frank, but your plan
would not work every time. You ought to have had
something more to base your suspicion on before you
decided that Pale: was the guilty inan.
