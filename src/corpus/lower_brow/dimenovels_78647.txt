A “But how did. shegleave the palace, since she did
_ not pass the guard?”~‘-I I - .
“Have you ‘forgotten, Mr. Carter, that when you
were here, before our war with Russia, you learned
I I that there were many secret methods of entering and
‘ ,_ leaving the palace?” *
, “No; but  did not suppose that any of them were
If known to Talika.”
T “Nor I; but who knows? She may have discovered
‘one by accident. However, the fact remains that_she
has temporarily disappeared. When she returns, as I
I have no doubt she will after your departure, I will
tell her that you wished to see her, and that we
I searched for her. It will delight and please her even
more than hollow good-bys would do.”
“Thank you, your majesty. And now I really must
go.» May I say in parting that I am very proud of
your majesty’s friendship? And may I add that if
the time should ever come when you have need o_f my
services, you have only to send for me ?” '
“Iknow that, Mr. Carter.”
, The ‘detective took his leave then, and hastened to
' the train which was to bear him to the steamship.
~ But all the way down there he was worried, vaguely
about Talika. He felt a premonition that he had not
‘seen or heard the last of‘ her, although he could not
if have told what form that premonition took.

2, I So absorbed was he in thoughts of her, and of all
 that had happened since he cam-e to Japan, that he
° momentarily forgot all about the information the

]mikado had given him relative to General Lakatira
and Tom Harnett.

  It was not ‘until he had passed aboard the ship and

 so; and Nick.felt that a roll of paper had been thrust

CHAPTER II.

NICK CARTER’S SPECIAL BODY-GUARD.

...-.-q

The “roll” of paper, if roll it could be called,
proved to be a long narrow strip that had been rolled
tightly together, and as Nick began to unwind it
he d_iscovered that it was a message written in the
Japanese, "beginning at the top and extending down-
ward along the strip. ' '

The translation of it was as follows:

“I-IoNoR2xBLE MR. CARTER: Beware of dangers’
which will pursue you across the ocean, even to your
own country if it should happen that you do not suc-
cumb to them before America is reached. Although ,
General Maoki is now a prisoner and will speedily be
condemned to death, his hate has found a way to be
revenged upon you, even though he shall be dead
when that revenge is consummated. What form that '
revenge will take or when and how it will be carriecl,_
out is not known to the writer; nor are the enemies ‘‘
who will go with you on the ship known to the writer ;’.* 

but that those enemies will be there, is known, “so  
watchful, honorable and illustrious one, lestl youTfall“- 

a victim to their machinations.

«The arm of Maoki is long even in death.‘ There{‘_ 

are Samauri who have served him, who will be faith-

ful and loyal to his memory and his wishes, even A 2

to the extent of taking your life. Do not walk alone
upon the decks of theship at night. Do not eat, save
at the general table where all are eating together.

-Accept nothing from any stranger while on the voy-

age; Do not stand alone with your back turned to~
ward others, at any time of the day or night. Keep]
yourself well guarded at all times. ~ "
“There are two persons to whom you may impart‘
this information, for they are faithful; but two only.
They,.are‘ Lakatira, the general, and Harnett. Consult ,..
with them about this and th'ey will tell you of the wise
dom of heeding the warning here given, since they I
can explain to you the signiﬁcance of the Samauri
oath of allegiance to his niaster; and some of the
Samauri who have served Maoki now seek your life.

“Lastly, if there are secret enemies against you *.
aboard the ship on which you sail, there are also

secret friends there, to watch over you. And, oh,
honorable sir, do not try to discover those secret
friends, lest you place impediments in the way of their ,
service to you. ‘

The detective read the letter through to, the  ll
twice. , - _ e . I
The translation of it made a curious combination of

A the stilted phraseology of the Japanese and the.di,—
rectness ‘of the English languages;

but he could not If ’
doubt its sincerity.

/' Indeed, there ‘was something about the .let_ter that

 "Presently he raised his eyes to Harnett, who was
if .watching him. . .
, ~ ’ “Tom,” he asked, “did you catch sight of that boy
i  who gave me this‘ note?” H _
; .“Can’t say that I did, Nick,” was_the reply.
i .“I’m sorry. I hoped that you had.”
' “Why ?”_ , ,
“I would like to question him. I’d like to know
where he received this message”
“What is‘ it ?”
 . , “Read it for yourself and tell me what you think
',of,it.”
He passed the message to his friend and stood
 { watching him While I-Iarnett read it; and he noticed
I  that, as Harnett began toundo the roll he gave a
" slight start, then frowned, andthen a strange smile

the interrogative reply. , .

‘<1: ' The detective shrugged his shoulders. .

, 3‘ “Yes,” he admitted; “but it seems folly to suppose
  that anybody is pursuing me aboard this ship merely
:‘ _.,to—.—oh, pshaw!” _ ‘ .
 He was silent again for a time, and then he turned
Qsiuddenly to his companion.

 “Tom,” he said, “when I passed that message to
you just now I watched you rather closely, and I saw
omething in your face which leads me to the supposi-

CHAPTER III.
THE MAN WHO DIED FQR_ NICK VCARTEER,

_“Now, general, let us have the story,” said the de- V I
tective, as soon as they were comfortably seated in‘ his 
stateroom. “What is _it all about, anyway?” »:  '

“If I should boil my reply down to a simpleistate-. fa ,
ment of the fact,” replied the general, with a sm_ile,,
“it is merely that your life has been threatened, and .
that I, with others, have been ordered to take'this- 
voyage with you in order to protect you.” I. i V  I‘ ~
I “That much, I believe, _we had already agreed upon;  
Who has threatened my life?” i I  I *

“Maoki.” ' '

“He is in prison, is he not?” I A y ..

“Yes; his body is the,re,"but his inﬂuence is as much” F I
at liberty as it ever was.” ‘ , 7 ‘ii A 7‘

“I don't think I quite understand that, general;’’7

“I am afraid, Mr. Carter, that with all yourpkinowl-L I "
edge of Japan you know very little about our Sa— ?
mauri,” was the reply. ,' . - ~ * L

“Then I will ask you to enlighten me.” 4  

“The original meaning, of the Samauri,” sai_d'thei.-
general introspectively, .“has almost disapp_ea,red—-—'onl
the surface. Beneath the surface, however, it has asdl‘
deep signiﬁcance as it ever did.”  .   

“Well?” ,! 

“In the days of the Sh0guns~—in the feudal-days of I
]apan——-the Samauri was merely a ﬁghting-man.‘ , He
had no other calling. He was a warrior and the 
nothing but bear arms, and ﬁght for his f'eudalVlor,d.l
His loyalty was pledged to that lord, or.baron,“llah4'
solutely, and with a Japanese, ‘loyalty of'.=»that'~sor:;g .
amounts to" fanaticism.” ' ‘  

“I have been told that.” M ' v ‘  - , ,

“Maoki ‘and his ancestors have been feudalmbarons. 
of. Nippon since our history began, and to 311.15,}-4-33,‘
Samauri who regardthemselves as owing allegiance '
to that family, Maoki in prison is no less their leader‘
than Maoki at the head of his army in the ﬁel‘d.".’. I

“I can understand that, also): . A p “K;  ,

I-so/ne day two weeks or more ago, and rescuing a child
.,from death? A child that was ‘directly in the path

of a big automobile approaching at great speed? Do
you recall that circumstance?”
.»“Yes,” replied the detective thoughtfully.
. “Well, that, child was the grandson of the Samauri
I have referred to.”
“AM. And for that reason ”

g“For that reason—because you saved the life of »

that child—-the man I have mentioned came to me and

4 told me of the plot that had been hatched against you.

He belonged to Maoki; his allegiance and loyalty were
as much the property of General Maoki as mine is to
my emperor. But all the same, you had saved the life
of his grandchild, and he could not let you be made
to suffer. So he came to me.”
' “And for once forgot his loyalty, eh?”

“Aye; but he paid the price.”

“The price? What do you mean?”

“I mean that after he had revealed to me all that it
was necessary I should know, in order to take measures

- for your protection, he straightway went out and
. killed himself.” '

p I ((What.’)J
_.“I thought you knew something of the history of

' ~the Sarnauri, Mr. Carter?”

“But-—-great heavens, man! It amounts to that
man giving his life to save mine.” _ A
e “That, sir, is exactly what he intended to do when

he came to me,” said the general calmly. ,.~

“And do you mean to tell me that you understood
-when he came to you that he intended to do such a
monstrous thing as that?” . —

'_ ,' “Certainly. There was nothing else for him to do.”

K(But..__..__,7
“Having repudiated his master, he had to die, and
It is the unwritten law of his
kind.” . ' ’
" “And he had already determined upon that before
he went to you with the story P”
‘ “Certainly.” ’ I
..“In other words, he deliberately committed suicide

 order that he might save me, who had happened,

by accident, to save his grandchild?”
“Yes.” I
» “It is incomprehensible!”
I “Not if youthoroughly understand the life-training

:of the Samauri, sir. He was face to .face with-two

obligations. One of those was to his master, whose

. soldier he was and whose family he had served since

his birth, as had his-fathers before him; the other

’ 3., ‘washis conscience, as you would call it.”

7!

“And he chose the latter, even though ,
_ .“I-Ieechose the latter because it involved his per-
sonal honor, While the former was merely a matter

'of‘ pride of loyalty. He could not do as he.did do
and live, for that would be continual dishonor; but

“The man’s name? What was it?” ‘ v . 4,

“That, Mr._Carter, I can never reveal to you.” A’

“Don’t mourn for him, .sir. He died bravely, will-

the highest of duties when he made his own death, 
necessary. He killed himself with the short sword- 
of the Samaurif’. . 

“And you knew when he left you that he intended ,_ .
to do so?” - J

“Certainly.”

“And made no effort to prevent it?”

“_‘I_..0gi,' 'Maoki said to him as soon as they were

called upon to act. The vengeance will probably be

“Cheerful prospect,” said the detective, smiling.

“ ‘You will keep this man Carter forever under sur-

-own country, if sail he does, you will go with him on
the same ship, but you will not raise your hand against
him or do aught to harm him until after he has arrived
in the city of his own home——New York, in the United

men were not to work together.” ‘ -
“Not at the start; that is true. But if the time aI- 
lotted to the ﬁrst one expires without the accomplish-
ment of the act, the second one takes his place; and 
then the second one has the right to command the; '
ﬁrst toassist him, and also to demand that he tell i
the second one what his original orders were, and 
explain why he has failed.” ~ 
“So, if number one fails, there are presently two on”

both fail, then, there are three on the trail. Is that the 
idea?” ' . .

The weight of it was like a giant hand pressing
against the vessel and gradually forcing it over on its
side until the huge mass of steal and iron was almost
on her beam-ends, and seemed to be held there in
suspense, helpless and impotent.

At the instant the gale struck him, Nic_k’s hand was
grasping an iron stay that passed just above his head,
and he clung to it with all his strength while his body
was ﬂung out straight away from it, like a flag ﬂying

* at .a mast. T ‘

"And so he hung for several minutes while it seemed
asif his arms would be pulled" from their sockets or
that his grasp upon the stay would be torn away
despite his great strength.

Presently, however, there came a lull; one of these
cessations in a hurricane during which the wind seems
to hold back for the sole purpose of gathering ad
ditional energy for a second onslaught. -

T It was sufficient, however, to enable him to get his
feet again upon the deck, to take his, hearings, to lo-
cateithe door through which he wished to pass to gain
the interior of the vessel; and then he released his hold
upon the iron stay, and with head down he riished for-
ward with an inward prayer that he might reach that
door before the giant ﬁngers of the hurricane could

- seize upon him again.

So he started for the main cabin door; started on a
run; but even as he did so, the second swoop of the
hurricane struck the vessel.

- The first one had been furious; this one was ter-
riﬁc. i

V Haveyou ever seen a feather in the grasp of a
sudden squall of wind?

It was so with the detective.
He was seized as if with hands; he was whirled
round and round as if he were on a pivot, only all

'  the time he was carried along the deck, his feet scarce-

ly‘ touching it at all.
, Then hecollided with something that was soft and

, yielding, and he seized upon it just as they were be-

ing carried past one of the upper saloon windows,
and? Nick caught one glimpse of the man he had
seized, discovering in that instant thatit was Hanshu,
the’ policeman.

Therewas a murderous-looking knife in Hanshu’s
hand, and even ‘in the storm it was raised to strike;

it but as the wind carried them both along the deck,

TERRORS OF/ THE TEMPEST.

It was a strange and curious freak of the gale that
spared Nick Carter’s life in that critical moment.’  j
The second rush of the mighty wind came from a A
different quarter from the ﬁrst one, and it-was much
more terriﬁc in force. 

It tore away’ everything that was movable from" 
the decks of the ship, and many, things that had been  .

     
  
 
   
 
    
   
  
 
   
  
 
  
  
   
 
  

On the upper deck three of the boats were wrenched. '
from the davits, smashed, and carried away, while‘
the davits themselves were twisted into ludicrousg
shapes, as if they were made of moist spaghetti in-
stead of wrought-iron as large as a inan’s_bicep'si_;
One of these boats was located almost directly oven
the spot where Nick Carter and the man Hanshu wer
thrown against the starboard rail. V -‘ I

This boat was not entirely carried away; that is, type:
rope that held it to the davit at the bow became.
jammed in the block, and with the result thatvthelv
boat itself struck the water, bounded into the air,‘
righted, and then, as the rope held, -it was dragge” I
along beside the ship in an almost vertical position 
with just the after end of the keel bounding froni '*‘

Nick could not see anything at?-all, but he could feel,

i A and, placing his hand against Hanshu’s. heart, he- dis-
 covered that it was still; there was nolpulsation there.

not seem to have been disturbed, replaced the satchels
where they had been before the storm, extinguished the

lights, and opened the door and peared out.
The storm had passed almost. Only the aftermath

' _of it was left. I

There was still half a gale of wind blowing, but
it was as nothing compared to what had been.
Returning, he seized the bundle he had tied with ‘a
string, and, stepping to the rail, he cast it into the
sea; then, placing such articles in hispockets as he
thought "he might need later on, and assuring himself
that, his money was safe, he passed out of the room,
closed the door,'and made his way slowly along the
deck to the smoking-room, where he entered and hud-
.dled himself in a corner of it. _ _ ‘
I-Iere, thoroughly exhausted by what he had" passed
through, he presently fell asleep, and it was ﬁve bells
—-—half.-past. six——_-when he awoke; awoke, to discover
that the captain was standing in front of him, staring
‘ down upon him. ‘
Nick glanced around him quickly, and discovered
that they were alone in the smoking-room; and then
the captain addressed him sharplyin Japanese.
.“Who might you be, and what are you sleeping
here for, instead of where you belong?” he demanded,
with suspicion in his tones. A
Again, with a hasty glance around him to assure
W himself that there were no listeners, Nick replied, and
in English:
_ “Captain, I was only waiting here until I ‘could
have an opportunity to speak with you alone. Will
you take me to the chart-room, where we are sure of
,» not being interrupted? I am one of your ﬁrst—cabin
passengers. I am Nick Carter.”

“The devil you are! What are you doing here?
".-‘And why that rig———if you are telling me the truth?”
 3 Nick got upon his feet. , '

 “Take me to the chart-room, captain, if you please,”
‘ A he said. “It is a matter of very great importance.”
I I V For aemoment the captain hesitated. It was plain
‘ that he was suspicious; plain that he did not yet be-
» lieve the statement; but after a moment he turned on
his heel and said, gruﬂly: J A‘
 “Come, then. But if you don’t« make good, it will

of the voyage.” . _. g .
_ _ The captain was hollow—eyed and worn with far-

itigue. _He had borne the whole brunt of the storm
 with all its accompanying responsibilities.

his experiences there, with the consequent results, and, l

' CHAPTER IX,
3 ‘ X , . THE BETRAYALgOFl A Ir?LO'l‘. .

I
.. It ‘was the second night after that when Nick‘Car-
er; in going to his stateroom‘-——the one ‘that had been
lssigned to him in his new character"-——was arrested
ifhile passing a door by the sound of/voices conversing
blow. tones and inthe ‘Japanese language. “ " I

    

- 1

It was not the sound of the voices, nor the language;

in which they were conversing, that attractedihim, but
he heard distinctly the utteranceof Lal<atira’s name,
and coupled with it was the name of Harnett.

The hour was late. Nick had been up forward in
the chart-room, smoking and chatting with thetcap-
tain, and it was now past midnight. The sea was as
calm as the Paciﬁc Ocean is popularly supposed, to be.
" After the utterance of those two names, only the
faint murmur of the voices came to the detective as
he listened, and presently he stepped closer to the
door, believing that they came from there.

But as he did so, the sound of the voices died out

-altogether. The door was open, however, and he

peered inside the room, only to discover that it was
empty save for one person, who was soundly sleep’-
ing  the lower berth.

“Hmm! A
stepped back again to his former position.

Again the voicescame to him in a lowmurmur.

Sometimes that murmur rose till he could distin~

guish here and there a word, and then it sank away V

again to a sound so faint that he could scarcely be
sure he heard it at all; and yet it did not seem to

«him that the speakers were raising or lowering their

voices. -
A It was some sort of a trick that the accoustic prop"-

erties of the vessel, or the action of the breeze, was

playing with him. ‘

Several times he altered his position, but each time,:_,;
with the result that he heard nothing at all save when 
She stood in that one particular spot. V ' ‘ ‘

Now and then‘ words of that conversation carrne to"

him, but neverconnectedly. I _ _,

But he gathered _in such words as v “Lakatira,”
“Maoki,” “vengeance,” “duty to the dead,” and he
heard his own name several times repeated, so it is

not strange that he longed to get nearer and to hear, I

exactly’ what was being said.
But he could not locate the source of the sounds,

do what he might, and at last, with a resigned shrug, ” i

he passed on to his own door, which was the second
beyond where he stood. - A

Just beyond this door was a narrow ﬂight of stairs
which communicated with the next deck above, and as

‘he was about to pass into his own room it occurred

to him that he would ascendto the upper deck 5for a
moment. ‘

He did "so, insilence, pausing. whenonly his head"
. ,,and ha1f_~his body__ were above the deck; and now again

I

   

:93 

That’s strange,” he thought; and he

   

   

the plainly heard the murmur of those same voices;
_hei discovered also how it happened that they had
" iireached him while he wasstill on the lower deck.
 'f._ L‘ " ;Sorne passenger who desired a great deal of air in
j J his room had caused a windsail to be rigged "beside his
' ~ﬁ7,window; that is, a piece of canvas had been stretched
‘Ca  tightly out at right angles with the window, to catch
 ,.what; air there was stirring and deﬂect it into the
“ ' room.“ ‘

._ _ The voices came from the room next to the one

CHAPTER X.

NICK CARTER OUTWITSI AN ASSASSIN.

The detective instantly determined how he would  i.e;»7;~
in this extremity. I ‘  V
He was aware of thi: fact that ‘there had been .ﬁ'vel_ ,
men engaged‘ in the consultation he had so fortunately‘ v 
overhgeard. _ He had been able to determine that much '  
by the sound of their voices, although he had picked 3

 

up only threeiof the names ; andwthe facesof the men 
.p.he hadrrot seen at all.'. _- * I  > :“ A . -

up Two of them only, had he seen at any time, and
those were the two he had noticedlnear the ship’s
' bulletin at the time of the announcement of the death‘
of Nick Carter; but even now he did not know how
to connect the names with them.
 He had heard" the names Noga_suka, Mustushimi,
and Kuroki used inside that room, but it was doubt-
ful if the men had taken passage on the ship under
their own names. .p-'' '
As he glided away hencongratulated himself on the
_ i fortunate circumstance which had enabled him to over-
’, hear that conversation, since if he had not done so, he
might have been sleeping by now, and, therefore, have
become“ an easy victim for the man who had been bad-
gered, by his associates into swearing that he would
commit the murder without more delay.

VVhen’Nick started away he hurried with all speed
down the narrow stairs to the deck below, and passed
into his own room. ’ ,
V He knew that he had but a few seconds in which
to accomplish what he wished to do, and_ the instant
he entered and closed the door after him, he seized
the extra blanket, which was lying in a roll at the
foot of his berth, pulled back. the covers of the bed,

i and forced the roll beneath them. _ ‘
Then he pulled the bedclothes over the rolled blan-
ket andtstepped back away from it just as he heard,
_. -"the stealthy tread of the assassin outside the door.
i-The man had stopped to listen to discover if his in-
Y tended victim were sleeping or. not.
Nick glanced toward his bed and smiled. There
‘ was just enough light coming in at the bull’s-eye open-
ningto enable one to see that there was something in
the bed; that, was all. It would require a close inspec-
ttion indeed to determine that is was not a man who
\ was sleeping there. V ' '
. i As he stepped back, he assumed a position which
 would bring him directly behind the door when it
should be opened; and then, as he knew the man was
listening, he breathed heavily a couple of times, like
a man who was sleeping soundly and well. ’
— The sound seemed to satisfy the assassin outside,

 turned. Then the. door was pushed slowly and si-
lently ajar. ‘

what he supposed to be a man stretched between ‘t-lie‘,

For a moment more he appeared to hesitate ;‘ bu
then he advanced slowly, thrusting one foot. acros
the threshold inside the room, and dragging the othe
one slowly after it. _ . ,  _.
He did not make a sound; and after that first 5&1
vance, he moved swiftly. / ‘, _ A i»
In an instant he was inside the room; in anoth
he was bending over the bed; and thien—-for ,_ .
could see him quitesplainly now——~‘he struck a; 
downward blow with his right hand, and

But whether he did or not, he had no time-to
orﬁto cry out, for no sooner had his arm fallenI_1

And he seized him, too, after a manner of his‘
grasping him by the throat—with his left hand
clutching him by his thick, black, coarse hair with.

Nick Carter worked rapidly now.

He pulled a pillow-case from one of the pil ,

for the ]ap’s ankles, and within three minute

, For just a moment then the detective was undecided
iwhat to do next. '_ , "
r _ He stood thinking for a, moment, then he lifted
"the man and threw him into the upper berth. l
 "T he Jap was conscious, although he was entirely
jh'élpless; and as the detective deposited him upon
heupper berth, he said:
 “If you try to roll out of there, you ’will only suc-
ée_d._in hurting yourself, so take my advice and don’t
ry it.” i V ‘
’_—,Nick left the room abruptly then, for he had de-
Btmined that he would capture the whole‘ gang while
' was about it. , _
 locked the door after ‘him and put the "key in"
‘.3’ pocket, and then made his way swiftly to the upper
ckagain. - r I
It was his purpose to goto the room where he had
erheard the consultation, to thrust his head in at
window, and, with a revolver in either hand, hold
'm._uP and demand thét they all surrender';_thus, he
ought, he would make an end of the whole con-

 
  
    
   
  
  
  
  
 

‘racy "at once.
‘There was a light burning in the room still, as
' ‘czkapproached it‘._ ' '

g He hesitated for a moment to listen, but could hear"

1 ‘sound, and he concluded that the other conspira-
ors were waiting in silence for the return of the
M ii who hadgone out to commit the act of assassi-
tion. ‘ _‘
Convinced of this-, thoroughly satisﬁed that the other
if ‘men were still there, Nick suddenly raised him—
f, stepped forward, thrust his head and shoulders

ro'om was deserted. , \ —
lt{—was a disappointment; a bitter gone, "too.

He withdrew as quickly as he had made the ad-

«ce7,. and, stepping aside into a shadow, waited "sev-

moments, listening for a sound of some sort, for
 ad“an idea that the four men might not be far

 that, however, he was mistaken. , . M

ship; and, reaching them, each got quickly into; his,

own berth. ‘ ' ‘i '7  ' _
As Nick thought the matter over, he‘ ‘realizedithat 

this was what had ‘happened; and he realized, also, that" 

i_-

t he was no nearer to ‘capturing the other four than he-‘

had been in the beg'inning.- ,_
More than that, his disguise had now become a»use— T
less thing indeed, since the assassins were perfectly‘
well aware who he was, thanks to theshrewdness.‘-of
the man who was called Nogasuka. 4 c .l '
i It was now nearly four o’clock in the morning, and
daylight was beginning to appear in the east. ‘ V
Nick returned to his own room, entered, and turned ‘,
on the lights; then he examined the feat‘ures‘of his, ?
captive, discovering as he did so that the man’ was ,
one of the two who had’ conversed in his hearing 'ne"ai'-.3 A

.the bulletin—boarCl the "morning after the storm’.

‘And he knew that the man was *Kurol<i, because’ of
the conversation he had overheard; he was also aware‘ ‘ i
that the other man whose face he knew was Nogasuka; p
but there were still at least three others, and possibly” '
more,‘ whose faces he did not know. i "  T

The Jap glared at ihimiwhilehe was making the in-.
vestigation, but, of course, he could not speak, since 
he was so thoroughly gagged. ‘ .

Nick drew back again and glanced at the lower, 1
berth, smiling grimly ‘as he did so, for there in mute '
evidence of what might have happened, piercing the
bedclothing and the rolled blariket to the guard, was '
the long knife that Kuroki had used when he entered
the room———used in the beliefxthathe "was driving the
weapon into the body of Nick Carter. V’  vs‘

The detective extinguished the light again and ‘Went V

forward" until he stood; as near the bridge as he could, , 
get; then he called softly to the oﬂicer on watch, » “
‘who was pacing slowly from’ port to starboard and 
the‘ gathering light of‘ the early_, ; 

backagain to port in
morning. _ _ , _ 
The oﬂicer on watch did not reply to him at iﬁrst, but" 7»
as Nick repeated his low-toned ‘call, he stopped, leaned iii T i
forward, and demanded to know what was wanted.‘  _
M . “I wish to know if the captain happens to be astir,” _'
said the detective. “If he is ‘not sleeping, Iiiwouldi .

liketto speak to him at once. If he is asleep, I

For a moment the second officer hesitated; then he
nodded and disappeared, anda moment later the door
of the chart-room was thrown open, and the captain
‘thrust his head outside.

“Come in,” he said, in a low tone. “I turned in
early last night, knowing that I would have a good

NiEw NICK CARTER ‘WEEKLY. ’ x  “:27, 

appointed for death by General Maoki, after his ar-
, "rest and imprisonment. There were six men named
,7 to carry out the decree of vengeance, and those six

_ engaged nine others to assist them, making ﬁfteen in

all.» Last night there was a consultationibetween ﬁve
, -‘of those men, during which your name was used.
F,  that is my excuse for my present attitude.”
 " He paused again», but still there was no answer.
 '. “Colonel Mustushimi, are you one of the original
 six men I. have referred to? I know that you would
‘not be "one of the other nine. Answer me.”
 ,“I am, general,” was the calm reply, uttered with-
out emotion of any kind.‘
A.‘ -“Then you are aware of the identity of the man
, ho is now holdingyou helpless?”
I “I suppose him to be the American who is called
 ick Carter.” ». ‘
“You are correct. How comes it that you are-serv-
hg in the interests of Maoki?” '

.“My father served his father and grandfather. My
oyalty belonged to him. The service I am now on
was repugnant to me, but rather than take my own
ife, I‘ accepted it. I do not like the /Yankees, any-
way, as you know. I would like to blow them off the
face of the earth, and drive them out of their ships.
I accepted the appointment.” '

' "And now?” '

“I am conquered, general. I am your prisoner.”
“Colonel Mustushimi, I have always respected you.
Would you have me release you P”

if ‘_7Yes, general: if you will do so.”

“-May I 1'61)’ UPOH you? Upon your honor?”
"You may.”

"§‘Without converse with your associates?”
“Yes.” i
.‘‘Release the colonel, Mr. Carter.”

Being released, Mustushimi turned and faced Nick
Then he bowed low, ﬁrst to him, then to
I-Ijarnett, then to thegeneral. Then, without a word,
Vurned abruptly and left the room, walkingwith

Nick was gazing in surprise at the old general, and
iifreplied to the unasked question: ,

_“The colonel is a warrior. He has won renown on
gtbpattle-ﬁegld. He.‘will supply the place of the law,
ydybe his own executioner, Mr. Carter. Colonel
Iustushimi is ’dead already, so far as the world is con-
irned.“ He will notexchange another word with his

or two or three, he willipass across the shadow into
the other life. He thanks me for it, and even now he

is thinking kind thoughts.of you for permitting himi

to die with honor. Come! Let us go outside into the
air. This has saddened me.” I

I The three passed out together to the deck and‘

strode along it to the waist of the ship, where the deck

extended from rail to rail. '
Here there were a number of passengers already in

evidence. A party of gentlemen and ladies were talk-

ing and laughing together near the starboard rail. >3

Over at the port side, a gentleman was bending over
a woman, evidently his mother, who reclined in a
steamer—chair. I
the rail that extended athwartships and divided that
part pf the vessel from the second—class passengers on
the next deck below, a group ofimen—]apanese, they
were——were' engaged in some kind of an animated
discussion. There were eight of them, Nick noticed,‘
and first one and then another and another glanced
up at their approach, until all the eight were gazing
with their eyes ﬁxed upon Nick Carter. ,

At the very center of the deck, standing alone and
looking off over the water, was Talika ; but she raised
her head at Nick’s approach, and smiledupon him.

Lakatira and Harriett had both stopped a few yards

in’ the rear, in response to a request of Mustushimi,
who intercepted them. i

As Nick Carter paused beside Talika, he half-i

turned his back toward the eight men who have been
mentioned, forgetting them utterly for the momenta,

“G_ood morning, Talika,” he said. “I, was hoping‘

7!

that you would be here, for I

E He was interrupted by a sharp cry of warning in the 7 in

voice of Lakatira; he heard, also, at the same instant,
the voice of Tom Harnett crying out. ‘A

He half-turned, and at that instant he was seized
from behind by many hands, and he felt himself lifted

from his feet and hurried toward the rail; also there I
was a sharp, ‘stinging pain in his side, which told him

that he had been stabbed.

A cry from the lips of Talika told him that she had ‘i, "
also been ‘seized; and then, as he exerted his great I

strength to the utmost and tore himself free from the

hands that had seized upon’him, he saw Talika asishei
was lifted from ‘her feet and hurled bodily over the .

post rail into the ocean.’

When he tore himself loose from the men who had ‘
attackecl him, others tried to seize him, but ,his_ﬁsts

shot out this way and that, clearing a space in front

Many anxious hearts had been awaiting, during the Christ-
mas and New-year celebrations, news concerning the safety
ifithe big Canadian Paciﬁc liner Mount Royal. This four-
master steamer of 7,000. tons left Antw_erp on December
7th, 1907, for St. John, New Brunswick, with 300 passengers
a1nd.a crew of 2oo on board. Allowing for delays, she was
ore than a fortnight overdue, and many began to fear,
is her safe arrival in Queenstown Harbor was flashed along
hewires, that one more wou/Id have to be added to the
orig list of missing vessels whose fate has never been prop-
‘r'1y_ determined. ’
People‘ began to think that, as in the case of the Allan
may Huronian, which, in’ February, 1902, quitted Glas-
goaw, for St. John and disappeared, leaving no trace as to her
- fate, the Mount Royal would never ‘be heard of again. until
he sea gave up its dead.

One of the most disastrous storms in its consequences
to lighthouses was in September, 1906, when forty~£our were,
either swept into the sea and lost or were so badly damaged
that no light could be shown. Four of the keepers were-
drowned. "

The importance’ of sticking to the job is shown by the‘? 

experience of ‘two sets of keepers of small lights in. a cer-»  

tain bay. .The bay, though it was more a river than a bay,

was full of ice, which threatened to carry the lighthouse'f'"i

away. Theitwo men at the light stuck to their post. _
The structure was carried off, was swept down a consid- _
erable distance, but ﬁnally lodged so that’ the men could
escape. They made things as fast as they could and

The ‘ Unconscious Crime.

A DETECTlVE’S PECULIAR EXPERIENCE.

One beautiful July morning, a messenger entered our

hqoﬂice and placed in the hands of the chief this laconic
V message: »

JOHN LEVONT.”

'‘ t/"Having read it, he passed it to me, saying‘:

a

"i,‘f:An.swer it in person, Herron. Mr. Levont is senior

Street.”
Twenty minutes later I was in the presence of Mr."

‘Levont, whom I found in hisprivate oﬁice, writing
' busily.

“Good morning!” he pleasantly remarked. “What can
I do for you?” i
“I have come here from the detective bureau, to which

"= you, a short time since, sent a message.”

Please be seated, and as soon as I’ve ﬁn-

“Oh, yes.

I , is_he'd'th_i_s letter_I will attend to you.”
/ down, and, while he was occupied with the mis-
.,tsive,‘icarefully studied him whom I had never seen be-
‘ fore. 
"  »,He was -"tall, well-built, possessed of faultless features,
’  wealth of hair upon his head, that showed not a single

bald spot, though the hair was white as snow, as was his
heavy mustache. — ' .
' ‘He was of very pleasing manners. . ‘ -
By the time I had completed this mental inventory, he
had sealed his letter, and, turning to me, said 2 I
“You will kindly excuse me for detaining you, but it
is highly important that my letter should go by the post
leaving the city at II :20”--ringing the bell as he spoke-—

» responsive to which a boy’ came, to whom he gavethe

niissive, requesting him to hasten it to the post-ofﬁce. ,

.Mr. Levont’s story was rather an old one, and this
‘ was its substance:  ’

“For some weeks “past,” said he, when we were alone,

 . “my wife has lost considerable sums of money, jewelry,

,diarnonds, etc., from her'sleeping—room; g V
“Now,‘invariably, when my wife retires to sleep, it is

 her custom,‘ after’ securing the doors and. the‘windows~.'...

the night, at least once a week, on opening',tl1_e’ safe I

“The peculiar part of it is, that she always ﬁnds ever

“This is the mystery which I have at last detenn nedﬁ
to engage a detective to solve.” . .. 5 1‘

“Very well, sir,” said I; “I will undertake the case,
I feel certain that the mystery is in the fact that ther
ists some secret way of ingress and egress to and I
the sleeping—room, of the existence of which .you’re‘

“I am at your service,” said I, adding: “Of I

“Of myself, my wife, a coachman, butler, and tw

“I am sure, however, they’re all innocent, for they"
all served faithfully, for Irnany years.” ' ' ’

“Possibly not.. But, by the way, has any one in

“One person.” . ‘E "

“Consequently above suspicion.”

“I think so.” I A «

“Can I see the maid?” _ I

“No ; she is not in my employ at present.”

“Gone where?” I asked. I

“I do not know.” * . r

Mr. Levont, in spite of his hauteur, seemed. —....i

Instinotively I crouched low as a ﬂame banished the  a

I was not a little astonishedto see the matchapplied‘
to a lamp that stood on a box, thus giving permanence to

The light shone full on the face of the woman. I .

Lifting the lamp, she moved to the farthest end of the" _; ‘

upon the somewhat loose ﬂoor, and, raising a short board,
disclosed a heap of shining matter below. i .7 ‘
