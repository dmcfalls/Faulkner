“He is a Syrian, chief, but he was borniin Madagas-

who commits murders because he enjoys it. In his travels;
somewhere he found the deadly blow—gun and the poi-
soned dart, and improved upon both of‘ them. It was»one
of his poisoned darts that Horton used to kill:Potter., I
The Syrianhhad made use of one of them the preceding
night to murder an accomplice of Horton’s whom Selim
wanted out oftthe way. I His name was Jack Seabright.‘
Selim is now invjail forythat murcler, and-I happen to‘
know that he has not been told of the arrestof his mas-2
ter.” . _ ' A i S
“Well, Con, what is your idea about it all?” V
“It is rather vague, but it is this: It occurred to lme;
that it might‘ not be a bad idea to let Selim escape. He;
is a bad man to let loose on the community, I know; but
the fact remains that he was conﬁdential man for Hot.
ton, and to a certain extent for Potter, also. ‘ I believe;
that if there is any man on the outsid‘e—I mean otheri I
than those two, Potter, who: is dead, and Horton, who]
is as good ,as dead—who could make a shrewd and ap-
proximately correct guess about those plates, it would

he seemed to have: to give at the present moment, and

‘i had finallytaken him to’ the strong~room on the top

next to the restaurant, and all trace of him lost.

futile attempt at disguise, but still show enough of the

man-eating tigers. They carry bells, and at night torches.
  There was until lately a pony expressmin China. From
T . the _palace at Pekin to the bounds of the empire the em-
"peror’s carriers galloped, shouting: “Way for the king’s
 .-messengers!” ’ r -"
_'They were begrimed with dust,‘ and their cut and bleed-
ing faces often show what perils they had encountered. The
T route ‘between Lassa,vthe capital of Thibet, and Pekin has
changes of horses, but not men. One man must ride night
" , and day the three thousand miles‘ distanee. Despatches have
been carried in twenty-ﬁve days. i
The man who is to carry the messages puts on a long robe,

V K’ in the lining of which are the despatches. The robe is then T

i tied fast and sealed upon the man, and must not be taken off.
_ The messenger rarely eats anything or sleeps; he, drinks a
 '= little “buttered tea” at stoppings, and smokes opium. This

keeps him up till he reaches the imperial city, and receives ~

great honors and large sums of money. No private mail
a is carried. by these messengers. ‘ . T

T  ‘ ‘There are picturesque mail-carriers yet. 'In the Landes
 France, where the ground is marshy, mail—carriers mount
  high stilts, and stride across the country as though on
"?s'evei1-league boots. They are not afraid of falling, fon they,
 can balance like jugglers; and it looks very quaint to see
 , one doff his cap and hand down a letterhto a pretty damsel.
.  ‘V_They.ca"melexpress of India is a gorgeous affair, with trap-
“K pings of high color on the camel and rider. The camel is a
 ‘ rabid traveler, doing sometimes eighty ‘miles a day; ‘but the
