Without saying anything more, the detective in-

been committed.“ , t

The two main apartments faced the street. Behind
the one to the left, which was on the main hall, was
the madam’s chamber, and next to this, on the side "
hall, was the girl’s room. One of the elevators was
situated at the point where the two halls joined.

The girl’s‘room beside the madarn’s apartment was
dark, but the ‘room in front of it contained alwindow‘ M

a low three-story building, the roof of which was di-

“Not if you look at her sharply. I had my sus-
picions aroused as soon as I heard her voice, and I
made up my mind to test her. I got her to throw one
of your paper weights out of the window at a cat, and
she threw it just as a woman throws and not a man.”

Mr. Maillard mused for a moment.

“I believe you are right. I’ll have her locked up at
once.”

“Do nothing of the kind. Don’t even let her‘ think
you suspect her.”

“Burg”

“She may know something of this mysterious rob-
bery. Mind, I don’t say she does, but it is best to wait
and see. You can have her arrested later on.” A

“It shall beas you say.” -

“Now, I want to know about Mr. Dilks, who occu- ‘
pies Room 126."

“What of him?”

“Who is he ?"

“I don’t know.

“Yes.”

The hotel proprietor left the office and came back in
ﬁve minutes. .

“Mr. Dilks engaged the room last Monday, and left
last-night,” he said. “Evans don’t know him. ii):
says the man talked iron, and he took the fellow to
some construction company's agent.” .

“Left last night? Where did he go to?”

“Evans_didn't know.” h

“Then that's all. Now, I’m ready to go to work!’

“I think you have done a little work already."

Nick smiled, but made no answer.

A little later he left the hotel. His disguise was»
‘completely changed, and now, instead of looking like .

“I can put Chick onto the thing. He can do such
work just as well as any one.”

It was close on to supper-time, when Nick presented
himself at the hotel again.

“Ah, Mr. Carter, I have just received a letter in
reference to the case,” said Mr. Maillard. \

“Indeed!”

“Yes.\ Here it is, you can read it for yourself."

Nick took the letter which had been scaled but not
posted, and read the following:

mistak when you had Miss Annette Garnet arrested

“What do you mean?” ,
. “I think she knows of something in ccﬂinection with
the case that she does not'care to tell." ’
“Ah, I see!”

“VVho brought this letter?" i
“I don't know. It was left on the desk during a
rush, and Evans did not pick it up for ﬁve or ten is
minutes after,” said Mr. Maillard. “Evidently the 
writer was not an educated man.” - ‘ V .g 

“The misspelling may be only a blind. One thing 
is certain, the party who wrote it was a foreigner, pose 
sibly a German or‘ a Frenchman.” ! p _ ‘ l,‘ »

line of writing that had been almost totally erased.

scope. , V .

“What do you  asked Mr. Maillard, eagerly.

“It is very faint.”

At length Nick began to put down letters.”

“.-—n—tt a--m--—-—”

He looked at them for a moment.

“Annette Garnet.” 1

“Indeed! Can you make out the rest?”

“Not at present. But, perhaps, I can after I pre-

“I’m in a hurry.” - - L  -—  - —« '
The man allowed the elevator to descend.
For about ﬁve seconds it had gone up out of sight.
As it did 30, Nick fancied that he heard an angry
and surprised exclamation.
Had he been seen?
They stopped at the second
out into the hall. ‘
The man and the bellboy had disappeared.
In vain Nick looked up and down and into the side
halls. 9 V ,
Not a trace of either could be seen. It was as
if the very ﬂoor had opened and swallowed them up.
For‘ once the great detective was surprised,

ﬂoor, and Nick passed

Never before had he witnessed such a rapidity of

movement.

His passing must have been noticed, and both bell-
boy and man must have run for it immediately.

Nick could not help but wonder who the two were.
and what the square package had contained.

The faces of both had been turnednaway from him.
and. in the dint light, Nick had noted nothing by
which either of them could be identiﬁed.

A-s he passed over the spot the detectives boot
preaseddown upon some hard, round substance that
lay imbedded in the soft carpet.

He stooped and picked the object up. ‘

It was a shoe button, similar to the one found in
the madanfs room .

Here was a clew. I

Beyond a doubt. the-man who had stolen the jewels
and the fellow who had attacked the bellboy were one
and the same. 0
_ But who was the fellow? .

Was it Mr. Dilks. formerly of Room ‘:26?

to Mr. Maillard. _ '
They were love letters, signed “Jean.” .

7 One in particular attriteted Nick’s attention.

Trsnshtod, it ran as follows:

V “Brmovnn ANNETTE :--Three long days_lia\je passed

“Yes, to-night."

- He moved in the direction of the voices, but when
he reached the spot no one was to be seen.

“Another failure,” he muttered to himself. “I
must be getting slow.”

Nick was terribly put out because he had not caught
the two speakers.

But he felt certain of one thing. That was that
one of them had been a man and the other a woman.

"Mammy Tooter’s, eh ?” he said to himself. “Then
Blinky Nolan is in the game, after all.”

The threads of the mystery were still widely sepa-
rated, but Nick was sure that sooner or later they
would come to a common center.

The few words he had heard made him change his
course of action.

There was to be a meeting of some kind at Mammy
Tooter’s that night. and he must be on hand to wit-
ness what took place. -

Mammy Tooter was a notorious fence, who, more
than once, had been up before the courts for receiving
stolen goods and sheltering criminals from the iron
hand of the law.

But for some reason or inﬂuence she had got 03
scot free. and her ranch was still in 3 ﬂourishing con-
dition. "  '
Nick knew that to enter the place he must stand

-:a rigid examination. .

Mammy Tooter and her son Jake were not to
taken in easily. and, ‘if discovered. Nick knew that
his life would be worth nothing more than the insur-
ance upon it. - - »- ‘

In thinking the matter over Nick came to the con-

‘clusion that the man he heard speak in the hall was

going to the old ience’s place to .see Nolan.

Why, he could not determine, excepting it might
be to concoct Some new villainy or Settle up for what
had been done.

Jumping into ’a cab. the detective was driven home "
with all possible speed. ’

Here he found Chick in deep conversation with
Patsy.

“VV ell, boys,’ anything new .9”. asked ixick, .

A little later Nick emerged from the house by the ~

 way. 9
He has oolnpletely disguised, not only his outward
appearance being changed, but even his underclothing
and the things he carried inrhis pocket.

CHAPTER VIII.
A RIGHT FOR LIFE.

So skillfully ‘did the great detective tell his story
that Blinky Nolan believed every word of it. "

The tough was greatly disturbed, for he well knew
that in killing the greatest detective in New York, as

he supposedihe had done, he had brought down upon 1

himself all the wt/ath of Captain Titus.

He knew the detective and the captain had been
warm friends, and that the latter would leave no
stone unturned to bring whoever was guilty to justice.

“It’s a lie, I didn't do it !" he burst out. J .

“Nick Carter said: you did, an’ his word goes every
time,” replied the detective. "De boss told me ter
tell yet to keep shady fer a long time ter come.” L

' “I intended ter do that, anyhow," replied Blinky.
.“I’m only waitin’ fer him ter pony up, an’ then I'll
slide out fer Ruggle’s place in Philly.” .'

“Wot’s .de boss gain’ ter" give yer’ fer dis job?"

Jake Tooter did so, and Nick proceeded to take a
light drink, and ﬁlled up Nolan's glass.
« “My trait, Blinky,” he went on. “Say I”
“spit it out.”
"Where did you meet the boss?”
“I was hangin’ ’round dc Hotel Royal, and did a

He had hardly uttered the words before Nick jumped
to his feet, and drew a revolver.

“I don’t allow any man ter talk ter me in that fash-
ion, sonny,” he exclaimed.

And he pointed the weapon at the man’s head.

The fellow tumbled back.

“Take that where it came from, or I’ll let the electric
lights shine right through yer carcass,” went on the
detective.

“What yer want ter say yer Eastern Frank fer?”
growled the man, in a lower tone.

“ ’Cause I am.”

“Yer a li-3-”

~“Stop thar, ’ceptin’ yer wants ter commit suicide."

“I’m Eastern Frank rneself.”

As the stranger uttered these words, Jake "Tooter
looked at the detective closely to note the effect.

But Nick did not falter. ‘-

“Yer say yer Eastern F rank,” he said, slowly.
“Well, I ain’t got no cousin, an’ I say yer a liar from
Liarville, an’ yer can't back it.”

At these words the stranger's face grew dark as
thunder, and he put his hand back to draw his pistol.

“Holdup, sonny!" ordered Nick. “Iywasn’t born
yesterday, an’ I don’t allow ennybody ter git the best

_of me in that style. Own up like a man, wot’s yer

right name?"
“My name is Eastern Frank, I tell yer." ’ L
“Yer a liar. I’ll give yer two minutes ter tell it
straight, or by the jurnpin’ snakes

The real Eastern Frank was completely stumped.

“Strike my friend, will yer!” howled the detective.
“Skip out of here before .I.pulver»ize yer.”

. The loud words and the blows drew the attention of
all the other men in the room, and they gathered
around.

; ‘‘Wot’s the row here?”

“Let them light it out in the _vard.’7
, “Don’t make so much noise, de cops will be down

‘‘Wot’s de trouble, Jake ?”

“I am, am I?” cried Jake !

Nevertheless he paused. . i ‘

But those behind pushed him forward, and Nick
soon found himself hemmed in. ‘

“Down with the spy.” _

“If hehis a detective, kill him on the spot!"

Nick said no more.

The time was past for? parleying: action was now
the order of the day.

Raising his pistol, he brought the butt down with
all force on Jake T ooter’s head. '

It made an ugly wound, and the man fell to the
floor stunned.

“He has killed my son,” shrieked Mammy Tooter.
“Kill him, kill him, boys! A hundred dollars to the

\

"first man who runs a knife through him.”

At these thrilling words a dozen blades were brand-
ished in the air.

For an instant Nick thought his last hour had come.

He resolved to ﬁght to the last.

Both arms shot out with tremendous force, and over
went two of the foremost men like a couple of tenpins.

“lam not to be taken. Stand back every one who
does not wish a bullet through his heart.”

“Good. I’m wid yer,” whispered Blinky.

And he reached out, and knocked over one of the

- smaller men. v

“See if"you can get to
whispered Nick.

Following this advice, the tough dove under the
table, came up on the other side, and made for the
door. ~

stop him. ' ’

Blinky was full of liquor or he never would have
done what he did.

That was to hit the old woman and knock her down.

CHAPTER IX.
- A TIGHT AND Rover: nx.

Nick was as much surprised as any one at the death
of Blinky Nolan. M

It pained him to think that the ‘tough had lost his
life while trying for once to do something that was
really praiseworthy. \ '

But now was no time to give this matter considera-

The attention of all present was drawn to Mammy
Tooter on the ﬂoor, and the corpse beside her.
For the moment the detective was forgotten.

“VVhat’s the matter ?" asked'the man, who had just
spoken to Nick.

“Did any one just come in here?" asked Tooter.

“Foley just came in." ‘

“Foley!” '

“What’s de matter wid you, Matt. Here I am.”

“Is that so. Well somebody just came in, an’ he
said as how it was you.”

“It’s that spy. Search the placp, boys!”

The men separated at once, looking under the beds
and into several closets.

In his place behind the curtain, Nick discovered a
partly closed window. He raised its sash to its full
height, and peered out.=

In the uncertain light he saw an alleyway some six
or seven feet wide Beyond was a house, the roof of
which was several feet higher than the window.

Could he jump from the window and catch the gut-
ter of that root’? It was a risky thing to try. but was
it as bad as to remain where he was?

In two seconds Nick was through the window and‘
standing on the sill. Another secbnd and he would
have taken the jump.

But at that instant a pair of strong hands grasped
him by the ankle. “

“Here he is, Jake I've got him.”

Nick tried to kick the speaker. but the chap was
smart enough to keep at arm's length. ‘

In a moment Jake Tooter and the others appeared.
‘‘_We’ve got you at last, have we?" be snarled.
“Make another move an’ I’ll.blow the whole roof of

an inch, and peered in.

Two men were seated at a table, playing cards.

One was a short, stout man, evidently an English-

The other was 9. tall, slim fellow, with black, well-

the Englishman was saying.

Evidence pointed that way.
The young Frenchman had visited the maid on the
evening of the robbery.
He had been let in from the housetop next door by
the girl, and no doubt had departed the same way.

“\/Vhlo vos it ?”

“That's him.”

“We think so. He is somewhere about, and we are

Of course, Nick took in every word that was spoken.
At the same’ time he planned some means ofescape.

From the conversation he knew it would be useless '

to go back to the cellar, as that would but lead to the

Yet he must act quickly.
The hunters meant business.

the entry.
Nick looked aronn"d for the door leading to the yard.

It was locked top and bottom, and both the keys

were gone. .
To pick the two locks would take too much time.
Already one of the men was approaching.

’ v Forbes made his second report to the Fourth precinct.
‘ ‘ Then"/he shut the door of the ca.ll—box and made his
way carefully through the intense darkness and heavy
downpour of rain to his former place of shelter-the
‘ ’ a doorway of a house several blocks up the

His back was turned to Forbes, and the latter, with I
leap, was upon. him, his strong hands encircling the ras-
cal's throat.

Then, despite the fcllow’s efforts, the officer pinned

* him to the floor, face downward. his hands still retain-

ing their grip and choking the man into insensibility.

The unequal struggle soon ceased, and Forbes se- 

curely bound and gagged the thief.

Then he returned to the basement door and peered into i;

the darkness beyond. 
Satsilied, he stepped toward the hack.‘

He had almost reached it when a. ﬂash of lightning il-  

lumined the scene, revealing the fact that the ﬁgure was
no longer at the corner, but at the side of the vehicle.

The same ﬂash disclosed the oﬁicer’s presence and iden- 

tity, and a bullet whizzcd by his head.

Forbes sprang forward and‘ brought’ his clubbed re- V

volver down upon the man's head ere he could ﬁre again.

The fellow sank limply to the sidewalk, where the ol!i- 7 
cer secured his wrists and ankles with hcndcuﬁs, after , »:—':

which he gagged him and thrust him,in,side the hack.

Then he dragged the first thief from the house andr‘ .

placed him beside  companion, saw that both doors

were tightly closed, mounted the box and drove to his,‘pre- '_‘ if

The two criminals and their booty were turned over to

men had his jaw tied up. He said he had the tooth- T

ache. ' '

The other one said he had lost some jewelry, was look-
ing for it, had a search—warrant and he would like to
search the house. The farmer was scared, for he had
$15,000 in the house, as he was going to buy some land
the next day. But he .took them to all the rooms in the
house, and the last one which had the stand in. The

_ men made him take everything out and tell them what
everything was. And when they came to the money-box
. they made him open it. Just as he opened the box, one
of the men shot him dead. They tried to kill the grand-
child, but she escaped and called for help. The farm-
er’s wife rang the farm bell and the three farmhands,

who were on the way home, heard‘ it ring and thought it I,
strange for the farmbell to ring at ten o’clock in the night,

and they hurried home, but were too late. The murder-
ers had gone with the ﬁfteen thousand dollars. The
 fan-nhands scoured the whole place, but it was of no use.
  A douple of weeks after, three men were walking
" 4 “ around a town spending moneylike water. Two of the
men were neighbors of the murdered farmer. They were
known to be poor. They were arrested and put in jail.
Their trial came off. The grandchild recognized two of
the men'who murdered ‘ her grandfather. They were

- hanged. is they had a right to be.

anti went to Dallas, Tex. She then produced a small
locket with a miniature photo, which the old man at once

‘ recognized as his dead wife, and she his little Violet, who

had been stolen years ago.

Thus two hearts beat happily, but not as one life,
and the old man had his loving daughter for a companion
the rest of his days.

Two Boy Detectives.
(By Clement Y. Yates, Milford, Conn.)

On Monday, November 18. 18——, a prominent citizen
of Milford was attacked on the corner of West Main
and High streets by a man with a large stick, and he
turned around and ran home and arrived there breathless
and nearly scared to death. »

On the same night, 311'. Clark was attacked in the
\same place, and he, too. was scared and ran home.

Two boys, who were nicknamed “Nick" and "Chick,”
and who were amateur detectives, decided to solve this.
So_when "Nick” told "Chicl<,” they each took a man
to interview.

When they returned home, “Chick” asked “Nick" to
bring his man to their headquarters in an old barn at
9 P. M. sharp, and he said that he would.

Nine o'clock came, and Chick pulledhis man into a‘

dark corner of the yard just as he heard “Nick" come
up with Mr. Baldwin.

It was too dark to distinguish a person’s features, and
so when “Nick” and Mr. Clark came into sight, Mr.
Smith exclaimed:

“That’s the man.”

And Mr. Clark said: “Your partner has the criminal
in the shadow of those bushes.”

Then the two boys took their men into the barn, and,
by comparing notes, it was provgd that, instead of a
great crime having been committed, the two men had
run into each other. ,

Mr. Smith had oﬁered a reward of twenty-ﬁve dollars
for the arrest and conviction of his assailant, and he now
gave it to the boys after being convinced it had been a
collision.

but we had not the thief. We found tracks to the river,
and from it. We also found where a boat had been

: stuck in the sand. The nose pointed up the river. So
we proceeded slowly, but surely, till we found a farm
down the river where boats were. But on the river bank
were those same tracks. The owners got a search war-
rant and searched the farmer’s house and found the
goods, and the farmer with those shoes on. He was ar-
rested and sentenced to twelve months in the work~
house, and the owners gave us each a twenty dollar bill '
for our services. This was our first detective work, and
it was easy enough.

Killed Over a Shotgun.
(By Chas. Burbage, Sylvan Springs, Ark.)

Horace Denton, colored, unwillingly gave up his life
a forfeit for that of Tom Vestal. The conviction was
secured under a perfectly clear, but most peculiar, chain
of circumstantial evidence. The murder occurred in
January, 1902. Vestal resided in northern Arkansas.
He had traded at gun to Denton and Denton had given
him ‘a cow in payment, claiming the cow was this own,
but later it was found that the cow belonged to Ed. W il-
son, also colored, who resided near Denton. _
A few days later Vestal went to I)enton’s and got the
gun, telling enton that the cow belonged to Smith. On
the following day, Vestal was shot and killed while at
work in his field, near the house. Vestal’s wife. being in
the garden at the time. heard the report of ‘the gun and
saw Vestal fall. but she did not see the person who ﬁred
the hot. as the assassin was concealed in a, thick growth
of azel brush. She alarmed the neighbors. and a thor-
ough‘ Search was made. They discovered tracks behind
a tree where the murderer had fired from ambush. and
the ground being very soft. the tracks were easily fol»
lowed to acreek, in which the murderer had waded for
a half mile to ward of discovery. On the on he side‘ .
of the creek the tracks were found again. an it loddis
reset from there to Denton's house. The tracks showed — : 
plainly that the bootsworn by the man making them had < t
~’twenty-tour square-headed tacks in the heel of the boot
worn on the left foot. and nineteen round-headed tacks
in the heel of the right one. A girl at Demon's house
said that he came home wet to the waist and had taken
oti’ his boots and put on a pair of shoes.  K (K
~ -‘Denton was arrested. A Search was made, and the '
boots were found, in a hollow stump about a quarter of
1 mile from. the house, wherehe had hidden them. 
‘boots ﬁtted the tracks perfectly, even to the print of 1‘
