“Who is your friend P” Satan spoke sharply. A
Nick at once resolved to be frank and tell Satan all
about Patsyland the connection of both himself and
' his assistant with the Gerald Laken case. ‘He would
not be exposing any secret, for Satan,,bf course, knew
that Nick was engaged on the Laken case and that
Patsy had been lured to the saloon. ,
‘The smooth villain heard the story and affected the
greatest surprise. “Well, I never !”Ahe ejaculated. “So

“Very well,” replied Nick, “I am willing that you ‘

After the parting, Nick took an ‘.‘L’»’ train at First

where Gerald Laken ihadiregistered. _ I -
The millionaire had not retired. He had been ex-

pecting ‘ Nick’s ‘ coming, and greeted him with the

anxious inquiry: “Have it done anything?”.

The detective told his story and Laken sighed. “Poor 

Patsy!” he said. “I am afraid he has been killed.” '

, Nick’ shook his head, “No, he is alive. That is my .
feeling, and Iiam going to hold to it until-—-—-?”_ I

taking time by the forelock. My man was not there,
but a few judicious inquiries made me think I would
ﬁnd him at a jungle in Morrisiana. _

“Thither we went and in the jungle, aibrush hollow
among the trees, we passed the night’. Early this morn-
ing a new<:omer.appeared, the fellow called Jim Satan.
It was not getting—up time when he arrived, but I was
awake a1id‘_,I_liear<l hiin"‘ask the captain of the gang
if ‘Shorty’ were there.

“The word ‘Shorty’ made me prick up my ears. I

looked at the speaker sharply, ‘and the thought came,

to me that he might be the tall man who used the
revolver on your head, Nick, while you were choking

. the short one. The reply to the fellow’s question was,

‘Ain’t seen him fer two days.’ The next words of the
tall man seemed to resolve my conjecture into certainty.

“Then, ‘Shorty’ has been pinched. I was afraid of
it. I“left him in a hole last night. ‘XIVliat's he up
agin’ ?’ askeditliecaptain of the hoboes. ‘Rough house
in .a Water Street joint,’ was the reply. No more was

i said, then. The tall man hunted a place fora snooze

\and stayed there for a couple of hours.

“While the hoboes were preparing breakfast, I asked
my friend, the yegg, if he knew the tall man.
I knows him, sliglituallyj. he said’. ‘He's not one
ofus, but he hikes in once in a while andjdrops a few
bones. Acts of that kind have put him solid with the
gang. His name's Jim Satan. If he’s got another, I
never heard of it.’  s * I  i v

“ ‘Was this fellow Shorty his pal?’ I asked.

“ ‘Sure. ' They worked‘ together, Shorty doin’ the
roughwork an’ Jim usin’ his block.’ . ‘

“That was all :I wanted. I had lost Shorty, or rather
he had been found by some ie elsc'——and I thought I

' spotted your handiwork, Nick‘—-but I had discovered

'his partner, the brainy oneiof, the pair, and, therefore,

‘ the one to be feared. I I waited until Satan woke up,
4 I knew '
 it would be iimpossiblerto arrest Satanthere in the.
, jungleﬁfor the whole mob of hoboes would standby V

him and beat the life out of me. I must play fox.‘ "

and then I prepared for some delicate work.

‘Yes, ,

“I had had my breakfast stew, andyl had the shivers. ,

. I ..It was right, in’ aphysical sense, that I §lﬂQl1ld leave
=theI' jungle,» and it was right, in a professional sense,

that I"should_ do so.’’’ i

"It was lucky for me that the fellow" knew but ,three
or four of the gang.’ ‘There are changes every day,
as you know, Nick, some’ going ‘away‘a_nd ‘others com-

 in‘g,in". . The jyegg, who stuck to me bécausehe knew
I had a_ dollar or two in my jeans,’ introduced me to.

I did not go until he had disguised himself. He made

V pered:

no explanation for this action, and no questions were
asked by the hoboes. He ﬂung a dollar at the captain,
and then we_,three slid out of the jungle. ‘ I
“Before we entered the restaurant in Harlem I
slipped some money into the .~yegg’s hand and"’whis4‘
‘Something may happen inside. Whatever
you see, remember that it is none of our business.
You are all right, so long as you don’t meddle. Shut
up, no questions. I am running this funeral.’ t

“The yegger blinked his little eyes and lohked scared,
but I shook my head at him and put on. an ugly ex-
pression, Satan was walking ahead of us, and did not

“In the restaurant a table in a corner was found, a

The proprietor knows me, and I gave him a wink when H

I entered. He is his own waiter——the ‘place is a small

,wasfooled as I said before. I closed and locked the
‘door up there, and I sat between it and the door of the
cell. Along about one o’clock this morning I heard
a tapping'orn the basement door, I kept as still as

a mouse, for I.thought some one wasgtrying to get‘

in.‘ But ‘pretty soon I came to another conclusion.
Some one outside wanted to speak to me. 
“I got up, ascended the steps and ‘called out: ‘Who’s
there?’ The answer was, ‘I am Mr. Carter. I have
something particular to say to you.’ I am no detect-
ive. I have got a gdod common school education, and
Iknow a few: things, andil guess‘ I have a lot of things
to learn. You ought not to have placed a plain, ordi-
nary person in such a position of responsibility.”
“The decision is yours,” replied Nick,» curtly. “Now
go on with your story.” .
“Well, I unlocked‘ the door. I had no suspicion that
I took the person outside' to be
you.” = , , r 9
“How long was it before you discovered your mis-
take?” ‘asked the detective, ~sourly. , _ I _ '. '
The gardener made an effort to call up’a grin.
“About the ‘millionth part of a second,” he answered.
“As.I opened the door something occurred to my head,

 NEW NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

when I saw what the old, no, the young German had
done to him.” . 4 ,
Patsy’s story came to an end just as he and Chick ,
I ‘ were in sight of the‘ gate of the Laken residence.

CHAPTER VI.
‘WITHIN AN INCH or HIS LIFE.

Nick Carter showed surprise at he appearance of .
Patsy, but the feeling was not prono nced. He greeted
the young detective warmly, and refused to hear what
Patsy had to say for himself until after Mrs. Smithers’
late prisoner had had something to eat.

The story of the capture, ‘imprisonment and rescue

P deeply interested the great detective. His countenance
wore a look of satisfaction when Patsy came to the
endof his tale. I . 1 I
f‘I thought Shantytown might be worth a visit,’,’, he
said, “and, therefore, I sent Osterhaus’ there and "also
told Chick to take in the place. I think we arenear the
, I witnclaup. Osterhaus has done so well that I would not
V be surprised’ if he should come to us before_,.nig,:ht with

the good news that he has located Mrs. Smithers. And
N, that would A mean the location of Meg Alverson as
' well.’’3 I I ’ '
 _‘‘I suppose we must notify the coroner of the death
I of Jim Satan,” remarked Chick. p I
I “Yesl I’ll phone the oﬂice at once.’.’.   V, .

, This dutydone, Nick said to Laken, who had sat 
V silence during the conversation: ‘=‘IfK you will ‘go over
fl to New York within an hour, you can catch. the after-
C noon train for the South.” ' r i .

. The millionaire’s facebrightened instantly. M He had
been thinking of his wifeiand the detective’s suggestion
pleased him. i .  ' . ‘ i ‘ v , .
» L “You are a mind reader,” he replied with a? smile.
'3 “I. am anxious/to see‘ niyivwife, to know\ithat sheyis
 ,’alive and in no danger, and you have told me‘ how~ I
i can shorten the time oi waiting. 1 I willtake that train»
and meet her at Rlchmolld.” », v 9‘  -

“.G0od,”.said Nick. “With you outxof
can work with more comfort. The enemy will have
only me‘and“my~assi.s,tants to deal with.”. » I I‘ V 
,“Do youiwant me to. prepare a package. to put in

P “No. The tree matter isoff. It is Nick Carter a d

But such alternativeiaction was not required. At
ﬁve o’c1ock Fritz Osterhaus, flushed andvpanting,
walked up the avenue to the house. Nick was on the
porch, and his face showed, great relief when he saw
the young German.

“Well?” he asked quickly, “have you made it P”

“Oof I hafen’t, den you gan dake "my bet. fon a

Chick and Patsy, who had been strolling about the
grounds, came up »-and the quartet adjourned to
Laken’s study. Nick had been placed in charge of the
Laken ‘establishment pending the returri of the mil-
lionaire. ‘ . .

“'l‘al<e your time,” said‘Nick, pleasantly, ‘as Oster-
ha-us dropped‘ into a chair and began to -mop his per-

\

spiring face, “You have done wonders,Aandg}’ aré,_ ‘

ment. I could have arrested you, l\/Ieg, that night, I
A but therewas Patsy to consider. He was in the power I
of Mrs. Smithers, and your arrest then might not only
I mean the death of Patsy, but the escape, from. New
York of the woman who was wanted for the attempt
on -my life as well as for the blackmailing and con-
ﬁdence operations directed against Gerald Laken, the,
Long Island millionaire. Thorohgli consideration of
the matter convinced me that by watching you, Meg, I
could not only get Patsy out of a hole,.but also that I
could gather in the whole force of the enemy. Do
you see? Thereafter, while you’ thought you were
i playing with me, I was playing with you. And it was
a pretty game most of the4t’ime,.. There. were one or J
' two moves that surprised but did not disconcert me.
You made one, Meg, when you killed Jim Satari and
‘, released Patsy.” , ' I ‘I ~

“Oh, if I had only known,” said the woman ﬁercely,
“I would have trapped you in spite of your reputa-
tion for sagacity. And you did come near bidding
good-by to this world. If Red, the Rocky, had struck
you as he ought to have struck, the game would have
been ours.” ' ‘

I “Yes, that side move of Mrs. Smithers was a sur-,

prise. I suppose she wanted to make sure that I would
be out of the way to—night, and, therefore, hired Red
to way1ay..rne. But my ‘luck stayed with me, and the
end I sought was. reached despite the surprises.

“Of course you know, Meg, that the programme for
the raid here was not given to you as it was carried‘
out. The only part that was not changed without1
your knowledge was my ownf I appeared to you, as I
had promised, as the Chinaman. You were agitated
when you saw me on. the street, for you had hoped
that Red, the,Rocl<y’s, murderous plot had succeeded.
I will say that you gave very plausible explanation of

2 your nervousness, for you are an actress of fair abili-

ties. But you are not a star. Far’ from. it. A star
would have donebetter with the role of the yiouing

German. You overdid it,lMe‘I. You weréitoo ﬂip _ .

that I couldinot get out.” ’ .

Apart from his amazing feat? with prison bars and bolts,

_How TO MAKEA SIMPLE TENT.

Every [boy likes to have a tent, and a good one can be »
made at very little expense; the stormy afternoons and long
evenings of the winter‘ will be excellent times in which to

’ construct it.’ You can make either a wall-tent or an A, or

wedge—tent, whichever you prefer, 9 r
First make upyour mind which would best serve your
purpose, and about what size you want your tent to be.‘

- _ Then calculate how much canvas it would take.

This calculation may be done either by arithmetic or by

' chalking out on a pavement, or represent g with a string
7 2 on the ﬂoor the lines of the tent that are n cessary for your‘
V measurements.

For instance, to ﬁnd by arithmetic the
amount of canvas necessary, for a wedge-tent, square ‘the.
number representing the required height of the tent; square
also the number representing one-half of the required width
of thetent; add these two results, and ﬁnd the square root‘

;of the whole; the ﬁnal result will give you the measurement
i of the slanting line from the top of one of the upright poleS/ T
to the ground. Twice this measurement, besides about four

in/ches-snore for the hems and two; or three‘ inches to spare
for the rounding of the canvas over the top pole, will ‘give!
the length of one of the longvstrips of canvas. To ﬁnd out

divicling the required length of "your/ten't from front to
back by the width of the canvas, which for this purpose may
idth is
twentyénine inches, but one inch must be allowed for the

it seam. The amount of canvas necessary. for the front and

back of’ the tent is not so‘ easilydetermined, but‘-it may

readily be ﬁgured out closely‘ enough for youto make a,good «
estimate ofhow much canvas Swill be required altogether,
remembering that-where the door is to be the canvas. should
lap over. ‘ V t’  i ’
i f calculation is probably much the‘
more simple one of the two, especially for tents that have’
walls. “When youihave chalked out’ a lineto show the re--
,quired height of thetent, one for the length of it, ‘two for V

for “each hem and a few inches to spare, some of which may

' I THE TRUTH ABOUT SNAKE-CI,-IA-RMING. ‘ A

‘It may-be stated positively that snakes said to be charined ‘ "
are not drugged nor eleiztriﬁed. Neither are they hypno- 1
tized, for no human being .ever yet existed able to hypnotize. -
or’,mesme1*ize a sn,ak'e of any species whatsoever, .or to '
affect it in any way by what the gullible )public‘is pleased
to call the “power,/of the human”'eye.’’ 4. \ V ,

Neither are their fangs cut out, for the snakes used are
nearly always of a harmless species, and ’have, no ’more»:
venomous power than a rat or a pigeon. They are, for the. L
most part, boas——boa—constrictors—4from South America, of .-
al-1, snakes the most gentle and tractabIe,in disposition. Any 
on'e’can’ take up 'a boa, provided he acts gently and with a 
slight knowledge qf, the animal’s likes and dislikes. 
.‘There are things, however, which the boa will ﬁercely
resent, and’ these the charmer knows and carefully avo'i'ds.y
For. instance, should any one annov a .boa—constrictor"by«
pufﬁnghis breath strongly three or tour‘_tini1esii1it'o' the rep?
tile’s face, it will become so ﬁerce that the charmer _must- put ',
it away, or suffer the c0_nsequences‘of a ﬁerce paroxysm ofm.
hissing and biting rage, and a large boa’s bite is.\not to be ’,
thought lightly of, for he has six rows of teeth,‘,four in the ‘
er, all half an inch Iong,.;mc1 

 

as’ ﬁne as needles. .

The whole explanation" of this “snake-handling,” which, "
by courtesy, is called “charrning,” ‘i's this--the charmer
doesrtt hurt the snakes.’ He doesn’t frighten them. He
does none of the things whichwhe knows‘ will angerthem.
