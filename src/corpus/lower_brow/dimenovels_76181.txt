2 CHAPTER I.I.—Revenge land Moneya,

The boy, who had been an attentive "listener to
the conversation of the .,two canvas/men, huggeldj
the tree still closer in the darkness, and listened
more eagerly than ever,’ for, henow expected‘ tho‘
chief rascal to divulge the scheme he had in min
for getting square with Mr. Newton the pros’
prietor of the circus. He was a r y, out “of
work, and ‘out of money, wiho ha walked -man L’

if he could. His name was Joe Melville, and he
was an orphan, without home or friends. Luck
had been against him for a lon time, but a‘ g3§ps ’
woman he met along the roa two days he. or
had looked at his hand and told him, among other'_
things, that his luck would change when he reachk
ed Dover, and that he would strike the ‘tide, that
would lead on to fortune. ~ _ . I , " 
As she had told-him many truths concerning-
his past, he was inclined to put someyfaith in he
words. At any rate he felt encouraged, and con,
tinued on. his ‘way withffresh hope. He was ~pa,ss-he

Murdock. He had expected his companion would
come in‘ on the (project, but not without persua-
.slon. He neede a pal on the job, and Dan was
the only person he could trust. He felt as much
satisfaction in bringing his associate around to
his views as Old Nick is presumed to feel at e
fall of a soul from righteousness. He was a wick-
ed ruﬁian himself, and it was his object to make
’Hu.rley a bird of kindred feather. He knew that
whatever were Dan’s shortcomings he .,would
never go back on a pal, but he felt no such
scruples himself. He would feel’ no compunctions
V - about sacriﬁcing Hurley if at any time his inter-
‘ festswould be beneﬁted by doing so. ‘In that re-
spect he was just as slippery and treacherous as
the Old One himself.
‘ “Shake,” he said to
fclasped hands. ~"“Now;‘I’ll trustyou.
I have in view is this: Newton,’ you know, lives
out in your neighborhood. He lives with an old
. maid sister and his daughter, who is bein’ trained
for an equestrian act in the ring. Some time this
season he's goin’ to bring her out, under some
ghigh-falutin’ French name, as a foreign artist
~he’s engaged at an enormous salary. He’s a foxy
old rooster, Newton is.” ~
“ “She’s a handsome gal——-Jessie Nbwton, and as
r-light and graceful on a horse as any ma.-m’se1le
inythe business,” Sid Hurley. “She’s learnin’
theropes fast. but her old man won’t bill her till
Matthews, the equestrian director, says she’s

‘(Maybe so, but there’s many a slip between the

‘ cup’, andvthe lip.”
“That’s right she might meet with some acci-
ent afore the show started which would spoil her
chances for-all time,” said Murdock, signiﬁcantly.

‘ circumstances we’ve got to try some other plan. 

I don’t say that I've got anythin’ ag’in Jessie
Newton, but I know she’s the apple of the old’
man’s eye. If anythin’ was to happen to her he’d- '
go rip esmrin’ mad, then the show would go to
blazes anyway. Now it’s my idea that somethin’
shall happen to her to-night, see? One of them ,
misfortunes that nobody expects and consequently” ’ ,
can’t guard ag’in.” ,‘
‘fNo, no, Mark Murdock, she mustn't be harm— , ,
ed, I tell you,” cried Hurley, with feverish ear.— ' ~
nestness. “She must be left out of your plan or '
I’ll have nothin’ to do with it.” ‘
“What’s she to you?” asked Murdock, ﬁercely.
“She’s nothin’ to me, but ” ' '
“You soft—hearted slob, you’re stuck on her, too,
like’ the rest of the bunch,” snarled Murdock.
“_Do. you .s’pose s_he’d notice a common canvasman-.3 
like you'!_ I've sized her up. She’s got no use for’ " .
anybodv in the show except to have ’em admire ,
her, and run errands for her. Why she struck 
Ben Dav the other mornin’ in the face with her 
whip ’cause he accidentally made her horse shy '
while she was practicin’, and she had to jump of} "
to save herself.” I ~
“He didn’t say nothin’ to me about it,” said
Hurley. ' “ ”
“Of course he didn’t.

And you wouldn’t either’

. if she broke your jaw. You make me sick with, 

    

your blamed squeamishness. ’Cause she’s New-1 .
ton’s daughter, and has a handsome face, you
and the rest of the chaps think she’s an an el.‘ ‘

‘‘_I don’t care whether I know her or not, I
won’t raise my hand ag’in no woman,”,said Hi_71r-. _
ley, doggedly. ‘‘_I’m ready -to take a hand ag’in"‘* 
New-ton. We were ﬁred by his orders. Cutthe , 
gal out and we’ll talk business.” , _~
Murdock shot a look of malice at his compan—’ “"*";
ion. » For a moment it looked to the unseen watch~
er behind the tree as if the rascal meant to at-.
tack his pal. Then Murdock uttered a wicked} 1-
laugh. , 
“Oh, well, since you object to my plan we’ll say,
no more about it. ‘We’ll pass up the revenge and 
tackle the money end.” -  -1
“How do you expect to get this m.oney.yoa'
speasli about?” asked Hurley, showing some ins’ 
tere . ~ " , "
. “I happen to know that Newton received a bigf L 
sum of cash from the bank to—day, and that he i’ V
carried it out to his house.” » . 1. 
“,_You-2 know that, do you?” , ‘ 
“Yes. He ain’t got no safe there, so it. I —
ought,n’t to be so difficult for you and me to pa‘ , "
the house a visit some time after midnight and
get away with it.” , 
5‘I ain’t a burglar, neither areyou. W-e’r'e’
sure to bungle the job, and then we’ll go to pris
on, which wouldn’t suit me at all.” i l ' ‘ s '
“No danger of anythin’ happenin’ to us. I've‘:
been out to the house several times doin’ odd obs ‘
for Newton, and.I’ve got the lay of the “es:
down ﬁne. One of the cellar window gr-atin”s is
broken, and we can get in that way without any
one‘ bein’ the wiser. I heard Newton tell Mat
thews that he was goin’ to his lodgeto-night, :a.'nd>
didn’t expect to get home afore two in the marma-
in’, so we’ll have acouplae of -hours in whichto do

 which was"new, to him. Heﬁeltisorry he had

greed togstand in with Murdock, andwould have i

drawn outif the had possessed the courage to do
.so.-' His wavering attitude made the other canvas- .
man ‘mad, and he berated him for his indecision.
Finally Hurley agreed to stand by his companion.

 As they started of'f,: Joe moved around the

trunk to keep the tree between. him and the ras-

cals. In doing so :he- stepped on a round stone,

‘which. rolled under his weight and caused him»

to: fallwith some noise.‘ Murdock looked sharply

round and, seeing the boy’s shadow, uttered an
imprecation and, dashing at the tree, ‘seized Joe
by the collar ‘and yanked him up. °  i g 4

J “Where are you going, Mark?” asked‘ his pal.

 "Yes. There’s a dry well close to your barn.

f“We’ll put him out after we’ve put our job,
through,” said the other, who, however, had no"
intention of doing such’ a thing-

He meant that the well should be Joe’s grave,
but felt obliged to tempo:-ize with his companion
for the present. They passed in sight of the
lights ’ of a handsome residencehowned and oc-
‘cupiedr by William Newton, the proprietor of the
N circus.’ A mile and a half further on was the
' unpretentious cottage where Hurley and his wife

lived.’ Mrs. Hurley had cooked supper, eaten her
own, and had her ,husband’s warming on the
stove. She never waited more than ‘a reasonable
time for him, as he was rather’ irregular in at-
tendance at his meals, often not showing upyat
all.‘ For fear of attracting Mrs.- Hurley's at-
tention \Murdock stopped the wagon a few yards
from the gate of the lane which connected with .
the yard at the back of the house. He and Hur-
,_l‘e'y then pulled‘ Joe out of.the vehicle and carried
him up the lane between them. They skirted the

 

  

with loose boards. ‘ .

of the well and‘lowered the boy down into the
dry and long disused circular hole. When the
rope slackened Hurley tied the end of it around
onegof the planks that he replaced in position.
Murdock watched him witha wicked look. -

Joe’s feelings when he was lowered into the"
dry well may be_ better imagined than described. __
Bound and gagged as he was, his lower limbs
only being at liberty, he could do nothing to hel
himself. The well was faced-with cement lai
over brickwork. _

doubted if an cry hecould utter would be heard
by'~Mrs_. I-Iur ey at the house. He judged that
she was a good, honest woman, who was cursed
with an scamp for a husband, and he pitied her
from his heart, He also pitied himself under the
circumstances. From ,the conversation of the.
men he judged it was their intention ~.to release"
.him after they had robbed the house of the circus
proprietor. _ That was some -comfort, to be s‘ure7,_ _'

him to his fate, and he would probably die by.-
slow degrees at the bottom of the well. 

This disquieting thought gave him the shivers.
But a worse shock was in store. for him. He
heard a slight sound at the top of the well. Then
aelgissing voice of Murdock was projected down

 saw a dim ﬂash of light at the top of the well.

“Can you climb up if I lower a rope to you?”

she realized thatthe boy’s‘i:escue' was a matter
of more importance that the rope. 
“I’ll run and get the twine,” he said.
She was away about ﬁfteen minutes, which

“I’ve got the twine. I’ll tie the end to a" small
stone and send it down,” she said. : 3 ’
“All right, ma’am,” responded Joe. ‘ =
Presently he saw her leaning over the“ mouth
of the well, and her actions indicated that she
was letting the twine own. The stone ‘clicked
two or three times against the side of the well,
each time nearer to him than before. It. was so *

''»up himself and started the horse. In a minute

her husband outside the circus Winter quarters.

. A /‘Ah, if I could only get Dan to break with that
" rascal I might be able to persuade Mr. Newton

‘fMr. Newton is a gooda-hearted gentleman, but he
insists‘ on rigid’ discipline over his employees. I
, 'can’t blame him, for he has a lot of money in-
, vested in his business, and it costs a great deal of
money to run a circus.”

 “I do, and a lovely girl she is. I.believe Dan

. ness which I never can’ forget. Her father is
having her trained for the ring, though not with-
= but reluctance, I believe; but she seems to be
'« fascinated with life in the ring, and Dan says

. will make a star bareback rider.”_
V They now came in sight of the Newton home,
 hich Mrs. Hurley pointed out to Joe.

, It was a substantial, modern building, sitting
“back from the road in the midst of an extensive
‘ lawn. The inmates had evidently retired to rest,
;for there wasn’t a light to be seen in any of the

cries of the girl, whom he believed to be Jessie
Newton, and the fact that he had a revolver
nerved the boy— to the rather unequal task of fac-
ing two husky rascals, either of whom was phys
ically able to do him up. Murdock was the’. man-
he really _feared, for the fellow had shown a
brutal indifference to human life that bpded ii}. -
for the person who tried’ to corner him. . ‘ ' "
Joe worked himself backward through the win- ,
dow and dropped into the cellar. It was pretty i
dark the1'e.a_nd he was forced to move around‘,
slowly and with caution in order to avoid obstacles
while looking for the stairs that led up into the ‘.
ground ﬂoor of the house. He found the stairs"
in a few moments and rushed up, landing in a
small entry between the kitchen and the dining-;
room. Opening the nearest door he found him;
self looking into the main hall. It‘ was "dimly.

They were the_ cook and V the house-maid, 'whﬁ
slept on t_lie‘attic ﬂoor, bpt the boy had no. idea
of their identity. As Joe stepped forward to
s ea_k to them, they uttered a shriek apiece, and‘, ,
e uding him, kept on down. As neither of them
looked young enough to be Miss Newton, Jgtedet
them go on arid turned toward one of the doors
on the landing. As he laid his hand on '
rieai'est knob the door was opened "in hisyﬂfacev
and a _man came out with a bag loaded with
something over his shoulder. ~ _

He butted into Joe and then uttered an ex-V
clamation. There was a lamp,‘ burning in the
room he was leaving, and the rays fell on the
boy’s face. The light revealed the ‘man's identity
to_ Joe as _Dan Hurley. Hurley recognizedfhim
with an ejaculation of astonished consternation
and started back. .. «~

-smelled smoke. It seemed to come from the next
floor. He started up the ﬂight to ﬁnd out what
it meant. As he stepped on the landing'a door
opened and he saw a glare of ﬁre behind ‘the
burly form of Murdock, who ﬁlled the opening.

'“Good heavens!” breathed Joe. “The rascal
must have set the room aﬁre, intending to destroy
’ the house.” r
. « He had no time for another thought, as he was

face_ to face with the arch rascal himself. The
' leam of the ﬁre showed each to the other, and

knew they were up against it. Hurley gave a gasp ’

“You're my risoner."

Murdock, owever, was not so easy. Though

Mark Murdock, and the law will now deal with

“Say you so? But I shall not go to prison
without my revenge,” cried the scoundrel with an
imprecation.

“I’m shot, and I'm afraid fatally,” murmured
Mr. Newton, as Joe and the rider bore him into
the men’: dressing-room, and a groom was‘ sent
out into the ring to ask the services of some doc‘-
tor in the audience. Jessie had just ﬁnished
dressing after the grand entree, in which she
took part,,wh.en the two shots startled the occu-_
pants of both- dressing—room‘s. The “news soon
circulated that Mr. Newton had been shot by an
employee. Frantic with anxiety the girl rush

“Oh father, father, are you badly hurt?” she"

But the circus owner was unconscious , and
could not answer her tearful appeal.

When the doctor learned that the girl was the ’

on the front seat with him. There was some ex- , ’

citement in the audience, but the equestrian di— ~
rector calmed it by telling the spectators that one ~'
of the circus people had been wounded by the ac-

cidental discharge of a revolver. In the mean-

time Hurley and the dead policeman were loaded ,

the show was placed by the chapter of hardluclx
that hadihappened to it the preceding night, and
asked if Mr. Newton could under the ,ci_rcu1_n-
stances legally transfer his property to his
daughter, and whether that transfer would pre-
vent the property of the circus from bein s_ub—
ople bringi sui " for
damages for allegel injuries ‘sustame in conse-
‘quence of the iire.
the fact that Mr. Newton was liable to ' at
any moment, it would be advisable for h ‘to
make‘ the said transfer of his property to his
daughter so that the show, being in her ‘name,
could go on without being hampered b the juris-
diction of a court in the event of his eath. _‘
As to whether the transfer would offset an at-
tachment issued on behalf of a suit for‘ da
would largely depend on the view that-a judge
might take of the motive of said transfer. If e
thought it was executed for defeating the ends
of justice he would probably hold that an attach-
ment was valid and could b’e made. On the con-
trary, if he thought it had been executed in ood
‘faith, with the sole purpose of relieving the s an
of the embarrassment that the owner's death
would occasion, thereby enabling it to continue
in business, he would probably vacate _any attach-

ment so‘far as it app ied to the show’s property.

Joe said that it was solely for this reason that l.

he wished the transfer prepared, and he laid be-
fore the lawyer a complete schedule of the prop-

, erty of the circus, and requested that a docu-
. ment be prepared transferring all right and title

to Jessie Newton, r. Newton’s leg heir. The

lawyer promised to have the paper drawn in ..,

and sent it to the hos ital at the earliest possi e,
moment by his chief c erk, who was also a notary
public. Joe returned to the hospital and was
told that Mr. Newton's condition was unchanged.

He was permitted to see the circus man for a few ~ * ‘ ‘

minutes, and explained to him, without tellin
him anything‘ about the ﬁre, why it was consi ,-

ered necessary that, pending his stay at ‘the 1105- ‘

pit-al, and to prevent complications in the event
that his wound proved fatal, he should transfer

the show in its entirety to his daughter.'_ Mia. _
Newton agreed that it was a wise precaution, and -;
consented to the transfer, so when the lawyer's A

clerk arrived with the paper it was duly and
legally executed. Jessie then a pointed Joe her
general manager, and authorize _him to take full
control of the show.

, — The first thing he did. was to ‘telephone, the a'd-, ’ /
[Vance agent, brieﬂy explaining that the show

was at a temporary standstill owing to the ‘de-
struction of the big “top” and its contents, Next
he telegraphed the ﬁrm that ‘had sup lied Mr.

est period of time’ a new big “top” of‘ the same
dimensions as the old one.

said that he was her son, and that if e was bad
she would-not dee-rt him. _
‘V She ﬁnally persuaded her husband to let him

George came back home, but his father prohibited

“Well, it doesn't ‘satisfy me. Things were

, “Well, they W111 be against you again,” said‘

both sides making charges.

7 In one of, his speeches a Week later Jimmy was . vii
called [upon to explain certain charges which had .

made a statement that was veriﬁed by several wit-

v _ . brolte up the meeting for that evening-. The young
. ’ man who had interrupted the meeting attempted

, "to‘make an explanation, but the audience fairly.
‘ V * howled him down. The young man exclaimed;
’ ' “I can prove that he has made a false state-A

merit.” -
An old farmer named Ragland retorted:

“Prove it and I'll ‘_contribut»e one thousand’ dol-I _

 lars to sustain the bar-room of ‘this county.” .

The young man said he was not there defend’-

in’ the bar-rooms,‘ as he was not a drinking man

ladies were seen wearing white ribbons ,on which

V was printed. the sentiment:

__"I am for Truthjul James. For whom are you'?’’

topic for allthe papers in the State-and the

The Magistrate committal him to the Tombs

an investigation. It was found that Marino had
been living for gears in a room at New Chambers

WINDOW THERMOMETER HANDY

A thermometer is a sure and safe way to know
just how cold it is outside of the home, and to
have one fastened outside your window will save
you a lot of discomfort. It will aid in keeping the
temperature of the room even, because you do not
have to open the window and stick out your head
to find how cold it is.

class, consisting principally of engineers, man- .

It has decided that memlbers of the bourgeoisie
