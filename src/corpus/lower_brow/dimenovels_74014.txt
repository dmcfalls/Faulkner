 She threw out her claw~like ﬁngers at Dick's
‘ face, but the boy dodged them.’ Then sheswung
the strap and brought it down on the young
_expressman’s shoulders with all the force she’
could muster. _ A \

‘weight of the blow made Dick realize what the
girl was up against. He grapped thestrap and

passion. “I’l1 be the death of you for that!”

She’ ﬂew right at him tooth and ‘nail, and he
