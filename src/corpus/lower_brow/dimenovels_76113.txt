at the store this afternoon to see if you’ve gone
back to work.”
. _ Thus speaking Bob walked off, leaving his
"friend seated on a low bluff overlooking the broad

'‘ ~“  . Atlantic, which at this point curved into the sandy

. shore with a bold sweep, forming the shallow har-
‘ . bor of Rockhaven that of recent years had come
into some local prominence as a summer resort. It
. was now about ten o'clock, and there were a num-
ber of bathers, mostly of the fair sex, gamboling
and swimming about in the light surf. There was
one in particular who had attracted special notice
‘from Ed. She was a perfect little beauty, both
in face and ﬁgure, and about sixteen years of age.
.She was the most graceful little swimmer he had
even seen, and she could dive like a porpoise. She
was more daring than the others, would go out
' -« ,as far as the end of the life—line, and hang there,
7 .with her feet beating in the heaving water, ap-
parently enjoving the sensation; but was always
’ immediately recalled bv a well-dressed gentleman
on the shore, who appeared to be her father. Ed
., "admired her antics greatly, because he was a
[ ﬁrst—class swimmer himself. I-Ie’d have given any-
‘thing for the hondr of her acquaintance, and the
privilege of swimming around with her. But
‘she was far removed from his humble sphere in
life, for she appeared to be a young lady of some
''''’considerable social standing, which indicated that
V, ‘her parents were well off.
' ‘ At length she came out of the water and stood
j talking to her father. Evidently he thought she
had been in long enough, f-or he pointed to the
..bathing-houses and laid his hand on her shoulder,
jas ifurging her to go in and dress. ‘She ob-
jected, and danced around him in a frolicsome
way. Finally she tagged him and ran toward the
bluff on which Ed sat a little distance out from
the beach. The gentleman chased her, but stood
a ‘no’ chance of overtaking her. The lower part of
T the bluff was composed of rocks, piled up in a
~ confused line, running out for some distance. At
‘this point there was a dangerous undertow, of
';.which all the bathers had been warned. In ad-
dition there was a sign stuck at the foot of the
rocks with the word “DANGER” in capital let-
. ters. Ignoring the sign the girl began to clamber
up the rocks, laughing in high glee at having out-
"witted her father, and then started to scamper
 out over them. Her father shouted to her in a
tone of great concern. »
“Comeback, Dora, come back.” . .
. . She paid no attention, but mounting the high-
 , est rock in the bunch made a motion as if she in-
'"tended diving off it. Ed, knowing the peril of
fthat place, sprang on his feet and shouted_to
._ her. She turned around and looked up at ‘him,
. apparently thinking he had ,a great nerve to ad-
‘dress her. Seeing that she ‘disregarded his call,
.- he hurried further out on the bluff to watch her
in case she did jump in. T
_ ,,“Dora, Dora, don’t jump,” cried her father,
 anxiously.
The girl ap -arently wished to tease him, and
' ,, made another luff to dive. This time she leaned
 a‘ little too far over, her shapely foot slipped on
.1. the rock, and she pitched downward in an un-
graceful way, striking the water awkwardly with
.a splash, and disappearing under the surface.
‘Her father, in great dismay, rushed up on the
rocks, and when he reached the top of them he

tracted father did, only plainer, for he was di-
rectly above the girl. He perceived thatshe‘

.was unconscious, and that unless a good swim-—

mer went to her aid she would soon be drowned
There was no good swimmer near enough tobe
of any use but himself. Throwing off his jacket,‘
and kicking off his shoes he dove straight down
into the sea, and struck out for the imperiled girl

_’ CHAPTER II.-—In Which Ed Saves the Sea
Nymph.

The girl’s father was ﬁlled with agony. Thoughl
noiswimmer he was on the point of plunging int “
the sea after his child when he saw Ed ‘launch’
himself from the top of,the bluff. ‘ ’ V’ -

“Save her, oh save‘my Dora!” cried the g'en'tl’e-_
man, wildly. v - _ ~

Ed didn’t hear his appeal. It would not have .
urged him to greater effort if he had. Already“:
he was cleaving the water like a ﬁsh in the wake "
of the prettv miss. The‘waves, however, were

 

bearing her out almost as fast as he was going; 

himself, aided’ by the sweep of the water. A’!-
ready both were beyond the .,end of the bluff, and :‘
the case looked kind of desperate. '

» if Ed could have saved her had she not recovers

consciousness and made some effort herself to
keep on the surface. She was in no condition,’
nor had she the strength to save herself. .She-
saw  at last trying to reach her, and began
swimming feebly toward him. No one knew bet-
ter than herself that her hopes lay in him. A

last he reached her. '-

“Don_’t catch. me,” he said. “I’ll save you.”,

“I will do as you say,” she replied, making no
move to-grapple him. Seeing.that he had a rea-
sonable creature to deal with, Ed felt that half.
the battle was already won. ~ '

‘,‘Put your arms around my neck-, miss, behind
me, and hold on, I’ll do the rest,” he said. "

Dora obeyed, feeling nerfect conﬁdence in,‘the‘.". :

brave boy who had come to her rescue. Ed then
struck out for the shore, taking lon agy
strokes. Dora’s father had watched d’s eﬂbrts
to save his daughter with mingled hope

anguish. He feared that the boy’s plucky efforts
would be fruitless. For awhile he had lost‘ sight‘
altogether of his child, and his heart stood still
as he pictured her lifeless body ﬂoating out to sea;
But following the boy’s head with his eyes he "E1:
last made out Dora’s face on the surface ,of the‘
water only a short way ahead. Then he sawtlle

two heads come together. ,

-“-ling a box of dates that the storekeeper had
opened that morning and incauti-ously left ex—
,. . posed within reach of a pilferer. Ed concluded
‘ not to face his uncle then, so he went around
to the back of the house to reach the stairs that
way. He had to pass through the kitchen, and
, he expected to meet Mrs. White there. She had
' , ;sh_arp ears, though no sharper than her tongue,
2 and she knew the step the moment she heard it.
“Where have you been all mornin’?” she de-
Imandedacidly, when= e stepped into the room
" - ‘gwhere she was prepa ing the noon meal.
" - “Down at the shore,” replied ‘Ed.
"‘Oh, you have. For the land’s sake, what

~’ , “Why, White can't put me in jail without

' ' it, .I’m not likely to go to the lock-up.”
"I thought you was there by this time.”
. “You did? Whatymade you think that?” .
“Because Abel sent for the constable and told
him to hunt you up.” . .
I “That was a mean thing for Mr. White to do.
It shows that he hasn’t got‘ much feeling for me,
jfthough his first wife was my aunt.”
V “And ain’t I your 8.li‘l'ilJ,‘t00? Though I reckon
you ain't no great honor to me. A boy who will

The constable looked inquiringly at Ed.
“There’s nothing suspicious’ about me taking.

a new boy and didn’t want a thief around the
house. That looks as if I had to move, doesn’t
it?” said Ed.
“If there’s any searching to be done, I’ll do it
at the lock-up, not here," said the constable. '
Ed thought of the roll of bills in his pocket,
ut he was not worried, for he knew he could

account for the money being in his possession. , - ‘*5-

‘‘I’m ready to go with you, Mr. Jones,” he saidff
.“Corne ‘on, then. You will be just in time to

So Ed and the officer walked oﬁ’ leisurely to‘-

the street who knew Mr. Jones and his vocation, ’ , 

there was nothing in the_manner of either that
gave_ them the least suspicion that the boy was
-a prisoner.

A

CHAPTER IV.—Ed Is Brought Before "
the Justice. .

The lock-up was next door to Mr. Jones’ cot-- " )
tage. It consisted of a small office and three
strong rooms with iron doors and barred windows,
all on one ﬂoor. In the rear of this building was
a barn where the constable kept his horse and ~ 

, light wagon.

Jones took his prisoner into his office.
e opened a book that he took from a drawer
of his desk. In it he entered Ed’s name, address,

is accuser, etc.

,“Novsr,” he said, “it’s my duty to search you.“  I

You may hand me whatever you have in ‘your _’
pockets, and I will put them down in the book." ~
“Very well,” said Ed. “To begin with, here is

a roll of money. Count it, please, for I haven’t _ 

had a chance to do that yet.” ‘
The constable looked astonished.
“This isn’t the money ”
“My uncle claims he lost?

It's my own, and,

fortunately, I’ can prove it. I saved the life of a. i ('7: 5,3:

young lady at the beach this morning, and her‘,
father loaned me that money.” . ‘—
._“Loaned it to you?”

“He wanted to give it
take it except as a loan. As I didn’t know but
I'd have to leave the store after the charge my’
uncle made against me, I thought it would be well

i

to have a little money to fallback on,” said Ed. I ’ ’ ' '

'I‘he,constable counted the roll, . —
“There is two hundred and ﬁfty dollars here-—
exactly the amount your uncle says was in the‘
pocketbook he lost. Rather singular coincidence, ' .
isn't it?” said the officer with a frown. f ’
“I admit that it is, but as long as I can account. ;.
for it what’s the difference?" replied the boy. V .

‘ “It is,” and Ed proceeded to relate the incident
~ in question to Bob.

“Gee! You’re all right, Ed. So you made two i‘

hundred and ﬁfty dollars by saving the girl?”
— “No; I only borrowed the money. ’ Mr. West
/ ﬂ Wanted to give it to me, but I wouldn’t have it
that way. I don't believe in taking pay for sav-
ing a person’s life. Life is one thing that’s above
. ﬁnancial consideration. ’ Mr; West no doubt con-
. siders his daughter of more importance than all
,_g he’s worth. He couldn’t really pay me for the
‘ service I rendered him. so why should I accept
fsuch a sum as two hundred and ﬁfty dollars?”
“I suppose you borrowed the monev to see you
through in case you broke with your uncle al-

.  together?”

.9 ' “I borrowed it with an eye to business. I’m
, ing to start an express route from here to
. '_ ampden.” .- '

“Do you mean that?” l

"I certainly do. , I’ve been ﬁguring on the mat-
ter for some time, though I had little expecta-
, tion of ever realizing my idea, because I saw no
“way of securing the capital to start with. Now
-. that I’ve got hold ofall the money I need, I’m

going to begin business right away.”

 

“I wish I could go in with you, but that’s out .

--of the question.” _
. “There’s only a living for one in it to start
‘ ._with; but I hope to build it up into a money-mak-
. , ing venture.” ‘
“I suppose you mean to make regular daily
 trips to Hampden and back in a wagon, ‘carrying
7 trunks and merchandise back. and forth?” 7
“That's the idea. It's a wonder to me that no
‘ such route has been established before, for it
 would be a great convenience to this place, par-
‘. ticularly when the summer boat from Boston has
,. stopped running. During the season most every-
*  thing is brought down on her, but she only makes
‘ one round trio a day, ‘leaving here at nine and
.  Boston at four. It takes her three hours. Now
\~ ~ the stage. that runs between this place and
I". ' Hampden carries. besides her passengers. only the
' I .. mail and express matter and baggage. Often the
, latter has to be brought here on a special team,
= «when there’s a rush of visitors. The store-keep-
f "er,s have had to get all their stuff down by boat,
or send specially to Hampden for it if they order
“it from the city by ‘rail. So you see there’s a
good opening for a regular express business be-
tween here and Hampden, and if Igdon’t tackle
-it somebody else will pretty soon.” .
0 .. “I guess you can do well at it. You’re strong
and used to work,” said Bob.
“I mean to push it for all it’s worth.”
.“Where are you going to live-—-here or in
jaﬂampden ?” V
“I shall live here, and makes two trips a day.”
‘ .“Two trips? That's going some. Do you think
you can keep thatup?”
"Why not. I guess a good horse can stand it,
_ .an if he can, I’ll hold up my end. My idea is
to eave here at seven in the morning so as to
“connect with the. train that reaches Hampden at
mine from Boston. I expect to be able to leave

 supposed he intended to quit the village. When
hevsaw that the boy had embarked in the very
.. business he had in view, he was somewhat stag-
ered. He swore some under his breath, for

“ on account of his youth, still there was a possibil-
pity that the boy might hurt him at the start.

Buck Norcross’ knows his business from the ' ;

Ed was on his way home, as he now called ‘
Bob's house, when he saw Norcross in front of '
the Riockhaven House talking to.one of the ha,-
bitues of the billiard and pool room. Buck saw
him, too, and hailed him when he was on the
point of passing. ’

“Say, you’ve got a nerve, Ed Andrews,” he said
in a grouchv tone. '

“What’s troubling you, Buck?” asked Ed, who
had a pretty shrewd notion that Norcross wanted
to say ‘something about his business announce-
ment in the News. ‘ =

“Nothin’ is troublin’ me, but I guess somethin'-
will be troublin’ you afore long,” replied the man,1g .»
pointedly. V . .\~.z.'u.$.

“What do you refer to?” - 

“You put an advertisement in to-day’s News
statin’ that you intend to carry on an express
business ‘tween here and Hampden.” ‘-"

“What if I did? Anything wrong in that?” 

“I s’pose you thinkvyou can do it?” , . -

“Yes, I think I can make a success of it.”

“What do you know about runnin’ an express 
route»? You’re only a store boy,” sneered Nor-
cross. -

“That’s one of my,business secrets.” ._ ,

‘‘It’s my opinion you won’t last more’n a week "’

“I’m sorry you have such a poor opinion of my
abilities.” _ r ~

“I ain't sayin’ nothin’ ag’in your abilities asa 
store boy. I reckon you’re smartas any boy at I
that. But you have a nerve thinkin’ you can run
an express route.”. ‘

“Suppose I have, you’re not particularly inter-
ested, are you, whether I make a success or fail-
ure of my venture?” : *

“Look here, Ed Andrews, what out it into your
head to take up with the express business?"[

. “Why do you ask?” - ' , -., «

“Because I'm goin’ into the business myself,
and there isn’t enough in it for two.” , 3.

“If you think that, you'd better stay out of i "

mented on by the editor of the News, who refer-
 red to his advertisement in another part of the
L 'faper, and said that his project would ﬁll a
ong-felt want. Before the boy met Buck Nor-
. cross he had called upon a dozen or more busi-
’ness men in the village, handed them his card,
anpdrtoldthem that on and after the following
.Monday he would be prepared to carry between
Rockhaven and Hampden any package of mer-
chandise, not too heavy to handle in a light
wa on, at reasonable rates. _
-, e received many promises of encouragement

were glad to have a daily express‘ route estab-
lished between Hampden and the village. In
one store a farmer, who was making some pur-
chases, asked him what he’d charge to carry three
barrels of potatoes from his farm, along the
'r€g.d he,-would traverse, to a Hampden grocery
s re. i
' “Twenty-ﬁve cents a barre ,” replied Ed.
 “Well, you can call on vour way Monday morn-
ingland get them,” said the farmer, telling him
. whereuhis place was. ‘ ‘‘I’m-pretty busy harvest-
_,._ 'ng now, and I can’t afford to, send a team to
V town with those potatoes.”

“All_ right, sir,” replied Ed, registering his
ﬁrst order.
. »"‘You might as well take a box of. goods .for
mek that Mr. Hickey," that was the name of the
farmer, “has just bought,” said the storekeeper.
.“It will be right on your way. How much will
‘on charge me?” i , ' .,
‘ “How big is the box?” asked Ed.
‘The store-keeper told him.

dollar isn’t much, but it's better than nothing;

Besides, it shows that I’ve made a real start.‘
Before Ed reached the Sedgwick house he pick-.

up two more commissions, amounting to nearly

another dollar, to take to Hampden. At the

supper table he told about his encounter with .r

Buck Norcross. ' -

“Buck is sore because you’ve gone into the
business that he picked out,” laughed Bob. “He
expected to enjoy a monopoly, and now you’ll
cut into hlS proﬁts. You'd better keep your eyes
skinned, for he's iust the chap to play you some
dirty trick to get even with you.”

“I don’t see what e can do. He will,prob-

ably run me down ‘ the merchants when he
goes around soliciting business, but I don’t think
his talk will carry far." ‘
_ “He can’t hurt you that Way. He'll try to do
It, of course, but you needn't mind that. What
I mean IS he’ll try to work oﬂ-‘ some scaly, under-
hand Job on you, hoping to put you out of busi-
ness. He isn’t to be trusted, so you want to keep
you weather eye lifting all the time."

::I’ll keep a watch out for him.”

If I was you I'd insure the wagon and horses. ‘
They represent the bulk of your invested capital." "
It won't pay you to take any chances,” said Bob. ' 

Ed thought his friend's suggestion good, and 
said ‘he would adopt it. Next morning when Ed, I
woke up the rain was pattering heavily on the _
roof. 'That fact reminded him that he ‘would ’

. have to buy a water roof garment to protect

himself against a possi le rain storm. He would ,
also need an oiled covering to protect the goods
he was carrym under the like circumstances.
It also struck him that he would need a couple"
of lamps, but ‘there was no immediate hurry to- ":
get them. ‘ 5, ‘
“It’s cost me over the original two "hundred .

der how Buck Norcross expects to start on one
hundred- It wouldn’t greatl . surprise me to
learn that he is the part w 0 got away with

the possibility of it, now it’s up to him to try -
and ﬁnd out whether there is any truth in it.”
The weather cleared durin the afternoon, and
Ed" went over to Wave Cree Cottage. He took. ,.
Bob with him and introduced him to Dora. Bob’ 9
was quite struck with the girl’; good looksgand
plquant manners. The three took a walk"'t2o‘-’

-andvit was a loss to them often to send their

zéangement with them to carry all their out-of-
town deliveries. He drove around the village to
places he had not yet vi\sYited, and caught on to
' couple of bundles for town. There was no‘
special need for. him to meet the Boston train
that afternoon, but he thought he had better keep

Buck got nothing else that day and he didn't

a. trunk for a quarter. As this was half what

Rorcross’ crony, whose name was Ira Bunker,
accompanied him with alacrity. They had several

ﬁdrinks for which Buck paid, and then they went
' outside. i

Before dark Bunker had ‘told a number of per-

il sons that Abel White had lost a poctketbook con-
Ctaining over two hundred dollars, and he hinted
that the store-keeper’s nephew might have taken

it'i,n order to get the funds to start his express

route.

Nobody in the village had bothered themselves

‘ about how Ed secured his capital until Bunker

began circulating his insinuations, then they be-

Vgan to wonder if there wasn't some truth in the

iiggestion, for two hundred or more dollars was
‘ ot of money for a store boy to have, especially
when it was now remembered Abel White had

: represented him to be a kind of charity boy he

had adﬁpted into his family out of the goodness
eart.

{in ‘a small village like Rockhaven, news of any
kind circulates fast. Reputations are torn to
shreds in short order on the ﬂimsiest of pretexts;
‘ Half of the inhabitants had lots of idle mo-
merits, and they were unhappy unless their
tongues were on the wag at those times.

’ .By the time that.Ed was eating his supper

 with the Sedgwicks, in happy unconsciousness of
7 what Dame Rumor was saying about him, a
Ugireat many of the villagers were talking about
_r:~tbe pocketbook that Abel White was reported to
‘fliave lost, and wondering why the news had not
vbeen printed in the paper that morning. The

general opinion seemed to be that _.the store-
keeper was keeping his loss quiet in consideration
In the course of several hours
Ira Bunker’s statement, ‘with its added insinua-

:..tions, had developed amazingly, so much so, in-
fideed, that he would scarcely have recognized it

as his original version.
‘ The fact that Ed had been able to invest two
or. three hundred dollars’ in an express route lent

J almost positive conﬁrmation to the prevailing sus-
picion. that he was guilty of stealing his uncle’s
5 missing pocketbook.

Store-keepers who had begun to patronize the

diustling young express boy heard the unsavory
] gossip, and began to wonder if there was any
»'truth in it.

if what was going on reached the boy’s ears, how-
ver, and he arrived home still ignorant that any
scandal had attached itself to his name.

‘Next morning_Ed went to see Dora, and Bob

brted the results of ‘his ﬁrst week to the Wests,

could be expected. .

that they walked further than Ed had intended ‘"

through a patch of woods with the young lady;

suggested that they sit down for a few minutes if
they Could ﬁnd a suitable spot. They soon came;,, .

going around about Ed Andrews?” 1 

“What?" ' . ’ p ,

“They say he stole a pocketbook from his uncle? ;

money to start his express business.” , — n

“I wouldn’t be, surprised if he did. He must "
have got the money somehow,” replied Buck. ' I

“I dbI1’t know about that. I've known Abel

‘it; at _‘the~boy’s head. Then he _turned, sprang
over the back fence, and ﬂed as fast as his legs
would carry him. Ed dodged the can and rushed
, topthe fence. He saw_ that it was useless to at-

,_ tempt to overtake the man if he wished to do it,

which was doubtful. He knew the fugitive was
.7 Norcross, and that answered all purposes. _He
‘ went" to the hole, picked up a handful of shavings
Iand smelt them. The odor of gasoline was strong
"upon them. He put his arm through the opening
and pulled out a handful of the shavings. There
[was quite apile of them inside. Norcross’ pur-
pose was evident. He had meant to set ﬁre to
the barn, and his object was to destroy Ed’s two
 horses and his wagon that were housed inside.

. Had his plan succeeded, another rse,_b_elon ng
to,Mr. Sedgwick, would, in all probability, ave
,- lost its life, while a bugigy, and much other prop-
. erty, would have been estroyed in common with
Ed’s possessions.

' , (‘The scoundrel!” exclaimed 'Ed. He’s worse

" than I ever thought he was. I must bring Bob
down here right away before anything is dis-
Jturbed, and show him the peril he were up
‘ -against.”

', He hurried back to his room, aroused Bob, told
, gim to dress and come down to the rear of the

am. ' J
'f‘Why, what’s the matter?” asked the aston-
:— ished Bob. l _
"f‘Do as I tell you and you’ll ﬁnd out,” replied
Ed, darting out of the door without further ex-
‘ planation, and returning to the barn. .

T ‘,B‘ob,'convinced that something very serious had
happened, lost no time in gettln into his clothes
~ and making for the back of the am. He found
_d waiting for him. Bob had entertained. the
V dea that he would see a dead body stretched out
onikthe ground, but on his arrival nothing like
that appeared to be around. '
 “What’s the trouble, Ed?” _

“See that hole and that pile of shavings?” said

 

    
  
   
   

,,,“P,ut your arm through the hole and see what
you feel.” ,
“ _Bob did so and pulled out a handful of shav-
. ings. '
i I’ .“Smell them,” said Ed.
; , u‘.‘Phew! What’s on them?” , ‘ .

‘ .,,“Gasoline, one of the most inﬂammable of liq-

‘ H
imgllvas somebody trying to set ﬁre to our barn?”
., .,pskéd Bob, waking up to the situation.
 “You’ve guessed it. I caught him at it not a
moment too soon. Guess who the rascal Was.”
V ‘ ."I couldn't. Did you recognize him?”

_" ?‘I did. -It was Buck Norcross.”

» “Y-ou don’t mean it,” gasped Bob.

. “I do mean it.”
; ‘ ,“He saw you and made his escape?’ ~

, “Yes. He ﬂew over that fence and ran to-
ward the next street. He's probably some dis-
=tance from here by this time.” _
=i ”“If you can swear that it was he we will have

your horses and ours would have been burned,’.
not speaking of your wagon, our buggy, a lot’ ’_
of other property, and the barn Itself. Even our ’ '-
house would have been threatened with destruc-_f
tion. B'uck has settled his own hash this time.—":
-“Will you go and bring Constable Jones here, ‘ ‘
or shall I?” ' 1
“I’ll go if you want me to.” I ~ . '» ,.
“Then chase yourself. I'll stay here and -
watch.” '*~‘* . 1
Bob hurried off to get the constable. He was - , ‘N
gone three-quarters of an hour, and he brought  . ~
Mr. Jones back with him. The constable had sew ,-
cured all the particulars from Bob, and was quite‘; ‘ 
prepared for the evidence of attempted arson Ed 
had to show him. ' i ‘ '
“It’s clear case that a ﬁre-bug has been at
work here,” said Jones. “Bob told me that you
came upon the rascal suddenly and recognized

 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
    
  
  
   
   

him as Buck Norcross.” _ .
h“Yes, it was Buck allright. I can answer to‘ 
t at.” '
,“Well; in the morning you must call on Jus-.
tice Smith’ and swear out a warrant against him.-
I’ll take it and hunt the’man up.” ~ . ,...
The shavings were removed to a hole in the ”‘r-“-*‘—
ground and set on ﬁre. Bob got a board, and 
a hammer and nails, and closed up the hole in 
the wall of the barn. The constable took charge 
of the can, which still contained perhaps half a- ,‘
pint of gasoline, to use as evidence. Ed then told
about the interview that he and Dora West had
overheard between Norcross and Abbott, the‘
storekee er, that evenin in the wood. «-
“You’ better call on bbott ﬁrst thing in th .
morning, and you’ll ﬁnd that he will admit sup-‘
pllymg Buck with a quart of gasoline ‘tonight.
e d_1dn’t suppose Norcross wanted it for any
bad‘ purpose. I heard him ask Buck what he was
going to do with it, and that rascal said he -wan
ed it for his wagon,” said Ed. . . . .
‘‘I’ll call on Abbott,” said the constable,’ who
then took his leave, while Ed and Bob returned’
to their room and went to bed. ' ,
Of course, Bob’s father and mother heard the.
particulars in the morning with no little conster-.
nation, and agreed that it was an act of Provi.
\dence which had enabled Ed to frustrate the ras-
cally design. Ed had to give up his morning"
trip to Hampden. After breakfast he went .1;
Justice Smith's house and told that gentleman.-
all the particulars. Together they went to 
office of the justice, and ‘Ed swore out the war a
rant charging Buck Norcross with attempted a
son. The warrant was handed to the constable.
to serve. Jones had already called on Abbott
and ‘that man conﬁrmed Ed’s statment that,-,-It
had sold Norcross a quart of gasoline the ni ht.
before. _ , /’ ' ’ '
“I did, it as 'a articular favor, for I don't,‘ :1

‘ -/\lVhen Ed left on his afternoon trip, with a
 «big load, Norcross had not yet been arrested, as
far as he knew. Constable Jones had visited the
cottage, [where he lived with his married sister,
and failed to ﬁnd him there. ‘He searched his
room, and among other things discovered a faded
red pocketbook which bore the name of Abel
White.
. ’~“So he was thegthief who stole this from the
’ storekeeper. and got Ed into trouble,” muttered
the'—oﬂ‘lcer. 5
' He examined the pocketbook, but there ap-
peared to be nothing in it now.’. It was clearthat
~Norcross had used the two ‘hundred and ﬁfty
dollars it had contained. Jones put it in his safe
when he got back to his oﬁice, intending to re-
xstore it. to ‘Mr. White, with an explanation of
how it came into his possession. Then he started
. off again to try and ﬁnd Buck. In the meantime
Ed went on to,town, made his deliveries, col-
lected several big packages at the station, and
came back, arriving half anihour later than
gausual. Long before that the whole village had
heard about Buck Norcros-s’ attempt to ﬁre the
'Sedgwick barn in order to put Ed, the Express
Boy, out of business. No great surprise was ex-
pressed that Buck should do such a thing. His‘
’ reputation _was bad, and those who knew him well
believed him capable of any crooked piece of
work. Constable Jones had been unable to find
him u to nightfall, so the general conclusion was
that e had skipped for parts unknown. ;His
horse and wagon were in the stable where he
kept them, and were likely to remain there in-
’deﬁnitely. Thus Ed was relieved of a rival in
his business, though the boy had not regarded
‘Buck as a dangerous factor, for the man seemed
utterly unsuited to engage in any occupation re-
.quiring ush and energy. At supper Bob told
Ed that e had called on Dora that afternoon and
told/her about Norcross’ attempt on the barn.
“What did she say?” asked Ed. .
V ' “She said it was most fortunate that you hap-
'pened to wake up in time to see‘ they rascal and
defeat his purpose.” _‘
7 “You can bet it was. I’d have been in a pretty
, ad hole if my horses and the wagon had been
destroyed. I guess Buck has played his last card
gainst me. If he knows when he’s well off
e’ll get out of the State, for he's sure to get a
‘stiff sentence if he's caught and brought to trial.”
. / .Buck’s desperate act so overshadowed the gos-
‘ ip-‘about Ed that the latter was lost sight of in
,f e shuﬂie, and nothing more was said about Abel
,'White’ stolen pocketbook. Ed continued to'have
plenty ‘to do during his second week, and his re-
ceipts were three times as large as what he took
n, the ﬁrst week. Altogether, the new express
oute was getting on swimmingl , though Ed’
found the hours long and the wor hard. ,

at this end of the season—-the exodus from the’
Village Summer cottages having already set in.‘
There was nobody on the seat but Owens‘ hini— ' '

the express box and the mail bag. He had taken‘  '
his time this afternoon, which enabled Ed, fol-“L

catch up with his single horse. 
“Get up, old nag,” chirriiped Ed to his horse;4-E  '
“don’t you smell oats waiting for you in ‘the ~

At that moment, through the calm evening air, ‘' ' ,_ _

Before coming in sight of the bridge, ~ Ed 
caught a view of the creek ahead where it swept, ‘
around in a semi-circular turn, and he saw,

in the cockpit, scooting over the water away from
the place where the bridge crossed. A few mo?"

It was his team,"=with Bob_ on the seat. Bob
brought two red lanterns with him, and_after
he had expressed his surprise at the condition of

' the bridge, the lanterns were attached to a piece

. of wood and stretched across each end of the

" important business in town, and he went on,
fordin the creek, while Ed and Bob Started f0?

’ “What had I better do?” asked Owens. help-

" Ed made several suggestions,_and then he and
Bob went off to make the deliveries on the wagon,
after which they went home, as Ed was mighty
hungry by this time. It was too late to’ call on

.‘ Dora then, for it was after ten oclock. How-

 ever, "Ed couldn’t resist the temptation to run,

down to the cottage to see whether she.had one
to bed, and, if so, to leave an_explanatio_n 0 his
failure to show up that evening. To his_great
delight he found Dora and her father sitting on

"“Yes.”. .

“Did you notice a sailboat-—e6me out of the
mouth of the creek. yonder and cross the harbor
toward the ocean?”

“Yes, I did; about an hour ago. She had a
big diamond-shaped patch on her mainsail,” re-
plied Dora. . _ . _

.r ,“That was‘ the boat. Which direction did she
.. go?” v V
'5, “To the north.” . . .
" “That’s toward Boston. She can’t have gone
a‘ reat way, for there is hardly any wind. I’m
going over to the bluff, where I 'umped in after

rascals who getaway with the mail bag and ex-
wgpress box are aboard of her, and they’ve got the

goods with them. She must be captured or Mr.

Owens will be in the soup badly.” . _

. “Ed started on his mission at once, and in
twenty miuutes was at the end of the _point or
uff.‘ Half a mile away, lying close In Sh0’!‘€,

as‘ the sailboat. Apparently she was anchored
waiting for a slant of wind, for it had fallen a
dead calm. At that moment he_saw a row_boat
tit ashore from her. His curiosity was excited,
and he started down the bluﬂ"~"1n her direction.
The boat entered a ,sma1l cove and_ was lost to
view. Ed started on the‘run, and in about ﬁve
’ inutes reached a clump of bushes at the back
of the cove. Looking down into the place he saw
the boat moored to the beach. The three men
“were on shore. While one held up a lighted lan-

CHAPTER XXII.
A Great Surprise.

of "many of the friends of George Williams, he

Some‘ parties had bet money that within a cer-

county, in both a social and ﬁnancial standpoint,
. A all kinds of invitations were sent to him to at-
, tend social functions.

,' His‘ mother insisted that one of his sisters
mould accompany him on such visits and keep
astrict watch over him to prevent him from

' ’ The wily enemies of the young man who were
’ trying to tempt himto his ruin conceived the
idea of circumventing that scheme, as certain
«parties withheld invitations to his sisters, and
. of course the girls did not go. »-

Sally Holmes volunteered to take the place of
‘. George’s sister, and Mrs. Williams thanked her
-and George acce ted her as a substitute.

His sister gla ly gave way ‘to her, of course;
i but it was quite a surprise to the schemers when
George attended the party with Sally.

, “Good heavens, -boys,” said one of them, “what
' ' sort of a girl is Sally Holmes?”

W .- “Why, Sally is all right,” said one.

, “Well, maybe she is, but how is it? Here she
 is with George Williams as her escort and Jimmy

, breaks our plans for the evenin altogether, for

she is more watchful than a bal eagle.”

_ They used other girls in an effort to get her

' out of the way and to draw George from her
side, but failed each time.

Then some of them started a rumor that Sall
‘had deserted Jimmy and accepted Geor e Wi-
liams as her lover. Jimmy of_ course, un erstood

-.it and so did George. ‘
"It happened that way two or three times, and
‘it really did look as though there was _some-
thing in it and that Sallyhad really gone back
on Jimmy. . ' ‘
;One day Sally said to him: .
“Jimmy, .1 don't like this talk that is going

 
 

 

all 1-through’ the county to ‘the effect; that I have ’

eserted you-”

“Neither do I, dear: but what is the r-ethedy ~-
for it? Why not let both of us go to the‘ par- _
son with our mothers and get hitched up to- 
gether for life.” - _

“All right,” said Sally. “Then we can attend ‘I.
all the parties with George,” and so the arrange-
ments were made.

George Williams agreed to act as best man
for Jimmy. and a day was set for them and
their friends to assemble at the little church and i
see them married. There was no secrecy about . ,
the affair, but Sally had arranged a plan to
give a great -surprise not only to George's family,‘ . ,
but to hers and Jimmy’s likewise. “

Sally had a friend named Emma Hitchcock,” .1
whom she knew to be very much in love with'._'_‘.
George, and George himself had a secret lik-
ing for her. ~. _,

Emma had made a conﬁdante of Sally, and, of 
course; she knew all about how each one felt  ,
toward the other. . ' " 

Jimmy had talked with George and learned his "
feelings toward the Hitchcock irl. .

“J1mmy,” said George, “if Emma could be '
persuaded to stand up with us and be married, *
I would be about as happy as you are.”

“That’s all right, George. Emma is all ri ht.
She wouldn’t say no if you“ asked her. ' he 
and Sally are conﬁdantes and it is not necessary 
for me to say anything more. IIf’you will only i 
speak to Emma you will ﬁnd that she is all }?;.-
right. She’ll be over to see Sally tomorrow after-
noon, and I’ll post Sally to make things easy
for you. Of course, it would be a very unusual
thing for a girl to make up her mind upon such "
short notice, but you know how Sally is. I be-
lieve that she can ioersaude her to enter into the — ‘
plot to surprise the whole community,” he said-.

“All right; ‘go ahead, Jimmy, I'll be the most
grateful fellow you ever saw if you can persuade
the parson to enter into the plot, and as soon
as you'and Sally are tied up hard and fast to
turn us and serve us likewise.” ,

Jimmy entered into the scheme most enthusia
ast1cal1_V and so did Sally as soon as ‘Jimmy men-
tioned the matter to her. Tliey both entereda;
buggy and drove to the parson’s residence, and
he entered into the -scheme eagerly. "

» The next day, in the afternoon, George went
to the home of Sally, and there met Jimmy and
his intended, when Emma came over, little dreainéc
ing what was in store for her. _ '

Sally had arranged the meeting in a timeg.
manner, and though George had been noti,-ii ‘
that Emma really loved him, somehow or other.
his heart failed him, and after he and Emma
had sat holding each other’s hands for nearly
hour, he had not yet popped the question.

Sally got out of patience and Went into th,
littt;le parlor where they were sitting and blur ‘
ou : ~  V
“George Williams, I’m out of all patience 
you, and you, too, Emma Hitchcock.” c _‘ 5»

“Why, what have I done, Sally?" asked Email
in no little surprise. _ r  

“You’ve done nothing, and that is what is
trouble. George is just dead in love with“ f
and wants you to be his wife, and you can't

' her husband was disappointing her. They were
to —go to the theater that night and in her hand
she held the tickets, and the carriage stood wait-

~“I’ll wait until ten minutes of eight, and then

‘ The Hardys lived in Twentieth street, near
Fifth avenue, up which thoroughfare the carriage

In the center of the plaza, formed by the inter-
section of Fifth avenue and Broadway, stands a
s-lamp with half a dozen or morejets, which
1 ights up the street very brilliantly for some feet
' on either side of it.

In the interior of the latter were a man and 9.

At» best the glance was but a brief one, so
rapidly did the carriages pass. But it was long
nough for Mrs. Hardy to make certain of a dis-
tressing fact—that the man in the other carriage
was her husband». .
"Sinking back among the cushions,‘ she uttered

‘such you should regard‘ and as such resent it.”

with anger. Thcrugh she loved her husband dear-

EAME AND FORTUNE 'WEEKLY

.  when I called every ‘night to see Mrs. Hardy.
. The =1ady’s grief had assumed a newphase. ' ‘In-
’ stead of moaning, and sobbing, and crying, she

was new hard and calm and self-possessed-—and, ‘

as I was made aware, decidedly irritable.

do.” ‘ , J
, , “You?” I gasped, in surprise.

. .. “Yes, I,” and her eyes glittered so strangely
that I looked at her more closely than I had be-
fore done. ’ _ V
 Instantly I saw what had happened. Although
,, not absolutely crazed by the loss of her husband,

‘ her mind was so completely upset that the step
» from her present condition to absolute insanity

would have been a=very short one.

   
  

“A good idea,” I presently returned, falling in .

I _. wvith her whim. “You would know this woman if
‘. ion saw her, and by fastening her down we may
~ e able to get at the truth.”

i I left, the house in a brown study. It was just
as well 'that —I should go home andwobtain a good
‘night's rest. After the time that had elapsed
it was unlikely that I could do James Hardy any
~._good, and after all said and done, the only clew
that could be obtained to the truth of his mys-
terious ‘disappearance would be through the wo-
man with whom he had been seen, and whom I
had vainly tried to run to earth. '
f7'The next morning I was in" hiding near. the
Hardy residence. '

» About ten o’clock Mrs. Hardy emerged. With-
out knowing it she passed within a very few feet
of me, and I saw that her eyes were very wild-
Iooking. When she _had passed I followed her,
and‘never_ for one minute lost sight of her. Up
and down Broadway she walked, never pausing,
as tireless as though every muscle was made of
steel. I-Iour after hour she continued this, and
looked.as fresh as ever, while I felt myself to b
completely fagged out. . ‘

'ni'ght began to fall. And during all this time
the never passed a woman into whase face she did
amt kee ly peer, causing many a one of them to
startb ck, frightened by the wildness and pierc-
ing expression of her brilliantly sparkling eyes.
, V he next day she came forth again, and again
‘I ollowed her. ,,
_ Up and down, to and fro-to and fro, up and
" do'wn—-I followed at her heels, block after block,
hour after hour. a _ _
Tired and weary, I plodded after her, wishing
would give up and go home. But she evi-
entlv had no intention of‘ doing so. She turned
of Broadway into one of the side streets.
‘Again I followed in her wake.
_ BI was disgusted, and little thought at that mo-
ment that in less «than ten minutes the mystery
would be solved. ‘But it was.

men and returned to the house. I begged Mrs.
Hardy to remain behind, but she would not do so.-

Had our character been guessed, access to the; .
house would not have easily been obtained. As it ‘ .
was, the door was opened incautiously, and Ijtook. ,

    
      
     
     
    

We rushed in. x
The negro man who opened the door was taken-

“George Tyner, you are my prisoner!” I stern-"

He was cornered, and dared not attempt to re—‘

Beyond these two whom we now had in custody:
there was no one in the house—‘that is, no other ’.

CI-IUGE CLOCK WITH MAN'S FACE TELLS
I TIME FOR GERMAN CITY
. This hometown of Otto Peltzer, the great run-
ner, has one of the most unusual tower clocks in
Germany. _ .~
 . In the center of its huge dial there is the terri-
fying face of a bearded man who every second
‘ rolls his eyes from right to left like a bogy man.
In his opened mouth he holds a metal plate on
which the day of the month is recorded. c
,. The clock adorns the tower of the castle once
inhabited by the Dukes of Pomerania, and now
devoted to municip-al purposes. It bears the in-
, , scription .“1_736.” ‘ '

  

   
 
 

FLEA TALKS)IN CODE

A“ talking, ﬂea, that communicates with whom
it may be tapping out signals in_a sort of simple
.Morse. code against its head with 1ts powerful
, "legs, is promised in the forthcoming ﬂea circus
‘ ,,Ib'y,»Professor Vittorio Pirelli. / _
/ It is claimed that under microscopic examina-

tion the flea, which is a female, is observed to
use two taps for “no” and one for “yes.” But
through its act the ﬂea is said to‘ signal “no”
~repeatedly if it disapproves of suggestions made
'by_ prodding it with a knitting needle.

The ﬂea is said to try vainly, and with ap—
parent, anger, to communicate with other ﬂeas
thatdo not seem to get the idea.
