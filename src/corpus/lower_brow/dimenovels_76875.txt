Pathways led among them. and, wherever there
was a‘ slab or a monument, there was a mound ‘cov-
ered with carefully—trimmed grass or flowers.

I It was, then, not a bank vault that these cautious
workers were trying to break into,>but a tomb. /

Ghouls were at work, and they were plying their
villainous trade in a place where lie some of the most
noted men that ever lived in America. ~

It was the famous Mount Auburn‘ Cemetery, just
outside of Cambridge, Massachusetts.

At the bottom of the slope where they were work-
ing was the. Charles River.

A high, iron ferice guarded the cemetery along the
bank. .

At a point where the fence ran closezto the river,
and concealed in the busltesithat grew there, was a
large, ﬂat-‘bottomed rowboat. '

It was drawn partly up on land, and on that end
of the boat a man sat waiting. .

A mile down the river, and on the other side,
W"l'l€l'¢. there was also a thick growth of bushes; was
a horse and a covered wagon. _ _

Beside the horse, witli his hand on the bridle, was
a man, and he, like the man on the boat, was waiting.

There was a watchman at the entrance to the,cem—

‘ etery, and others were making the rounds of the

main paths. ,
" Ghee a watchman came near the place where the
ghouls were at wotk. ,
They heard him in time. - .
Instead of running, they dropped, ﬂat upon the

. ground and lay perfectly still. '

.~The watchman passed within twenty feet of them.
Ije heard no sound, and, in the darkness, lie could

 ‘notidistinguish their bodies from the ground.

i:t$ttz:tlie=hole drilled:  -. . 

The gliouls ‘did not ﬁll it with powder and blow
the lock to pieces. ' _ T i

That would have brought watchmen to the spot in
a hurry. ,

For the breaking of this lock they had :1 better
(plan. b ‘

A small steel instrument, almost like a hook. was
pushed into the hole and turned about.

In a moment the tumblers of the lock were dis-
placed, and, after a few trials, the bolt was shot back
' easily. I
They opened the door.
The hinges,'creaked so loudly that they were
- frightened.
Shutting the door again, they crept hastily away
and lay down behind a grave.
Several minutes passed before thcyvstirred. '
Then, as nobody had come near, they cautiously
returned to the tomb.

The noise of drilling had been dcadened a good
deal by dropping oil on the iron. T

They’ had a small oil can with them for this pur-
pose.

It_was used now to stop the hinges from creaking.

A few dr-ops did the business.

The door was opened again, this time silently, and
the ghouls went inside the tomb.

For the ﬁrst time, then, they used a light.

One stood in the doorway and held his coat ‘out
with both hands to cover the opening as much as

v

possible.
The other stood with his back to the door and
struek apslow-burning match. H
T The ﬂame burned blue before it came to the wood,
and sent upsuch a cloud of sulphur smoke that the
man coughed.
His companion coughed under his breath.
“You’ll queer the whole game!” he muttered.
“Shut up !” whispered the other. .
Th'é ﬂame caught the wood, and, ior an instant,
they could see from end to end of the small, gloomy
froorn. .- .. x V,

As the watchman’s body was motionless, he bent
over and felt of the head where the blow had fallen.

 ‘It was on the -morning after Nick and Chick had
made important arrests.

They ‘had captured a swindler, Guy Preble, and
his Indian servant, Penola.
_ The case against them had taken such shape that
Nick had had them locked up on a- charge of at-
tempted murder. ‘

He was staying in Worcester for the purpose of

“I thought," he said, h_urriedly, as he took Nick's
hand, “that it would be better to come myself than
send a letter." _

Then he shook hands with Chick.

“\Vhat’s the trouble?" asked Nick.

“Nothing, so far as I am concerned,” replied
Fielding. “I want to interest you in a friend of mine
who has trouble enough for two.”

“Come up to my room and tell me about it."

They went upstairs, and, when they were alone,
Nick said: '

“Now, Jim, you know me of old. See if you can
tell your story straight from the beginning; and
I’ll bet a cigar with Chick," he added, smiling, “that
you can't do it.” p I

Fielding did not smile.

“I won't take the bet," said Chick.

“It’s all right for you two to joke,” said Fielding,
“but I can’t, for it’s a sad aﬁair, and I'll admit that
I don’t quite know what the beginning of it is.”

“\Vell, start in anywhere; then.”

“All right, Nick. The man I want you to work
for doesn’t know that I am laying the case before
you. If you undertake it, I don’t think I shall tell
him. But there has been a big reward offered, so
that you needn’t fear of losing anything”:

“Never mind that part of it, Jim; get down to’ the
case.” ’

I “This man is a friend and neighbor of mine named
Milton Hawley. Two weeks ago to-day his ﬁfteen-
year-old son died. He was buried in the family tomb
at Mount Auburn. Ten days ago the tomb was
broken into and the casket in which‘George Haw~

Fielding opened his eyes wide.

“It was cmbalmed by a‘ very skillful undertaker,”
he said. . i
. ‘‘Doubtless; but I will go further and tell you that
I believe that within twelve hours after the grave

ceased to exist.”'

“‘That's a startling statement. Nick, bilt it shows

Jirn,-'and I’ll explain.” I ' ' '

“‘I,~wish'you would.”
. “It's very simple, and I may be mistaken, "but

“I don't see."  .

.“The body was stolen probably some time between

“Drummond, of course, thought the reward would ~

He agreed heartily that it would be wise to put the

“ ‘If he takes the case,’ said Drummond, ‘ask him
to call on me. I should like to meet him.’

“You_ see, he's heard oiyou, Nick."

“So havea good many other people, Jim,” the de-
tective remarked, dryly.

“But you'll call onhim, won't you ?"

“Oh, of course; what's he professor of?”

“He used to be connected with one of the medical
schools in Boston, buthe retired years ago.”

Nick looked at- his watch.

“Ten days after the crime was committed,” he
said, thoughtfully. “Rather unfortunate, that; but
it can't he helped. The thing is not to let another
day pass without work of some kind.”

WEEKLY.

“Thank you,” responded Nick, as pleasantly as if
the superintendent had oftered to go with them; “I
suppose you have been overrun with curiosityi-seek-
ers since the robbery of that tomb ?"

“I should say so! The public has turned the cem-
etery into a show ground. But that doesn't matter
much, for the watchman can» generally, keep the
ordinary public_from the grass and ﬂower beds. ’ It’s
the infernal amateur detectives who are thennisance.
.Hawley’s big reward has set thousands of men to’
thinking that theyrcan solve’ the problem; Why! ‘
-for the first twoior three days after the robbery we *
had to have a large police force present to keep the
detectives in order.” « L /. p ,

“A detective is a troublesome sortof fellow, for a
fact,” remarked Nick.

“Especially the amateur,” added the superintend-
ent. ” 1 V’ H '

" “Of course; And are they still at it?”

‘*1 guess they are,‘ unless they have thought them-_
selves crazy. But we won’t be bothered with them
anyntore. Mr. Hawley himself has seen to that.”

“I understand. Not a word shall be said about it.
W'ill,you come righ.t along?”
f‘If, you please.” if
The superintendent ledpthem to the tomb.
There was no crowd hanging around. It was get-
V ting too late in the day, and it was too long since the
robberyifor the placeto be attractive to curiosity
seekers. ‘ L 
V Besides, the fact that strangers were no longer al-
lowed to ‘go near the tomb had become well known,
and people therefore stayed away. '
Nick remarked on the fact!
1“Yes,” admitted the superintendent; “I confess
that I overstated the facts. You see, I didn’t know
who you were. But it is a fact that until within a
day or two’ we have been bothered by crowds. Do
you want me to stay to answer any _questions P"
“No, thank you. - We shall look around, and prob-
, ably go away in ﬁve minutes.” - .
The superintendent notiﬁed the guards that these
gentlemen were tp be allowed to go where they
pleased, and left them. ‘
.'Nick glanced at the tomb.
“The lock has been repaired, of course,” said he,
and looked down the slope. A
“Brown was found in the river,” he went on,
thinking aloud. “The river is just at the bottom of

‘_ theghoulsyto make off with their_plunder. For, not

Then he pulled the post next to it in the same
way.

That one gave also.

“They didn't lift the cofﬁn over the fence,” was
all he said, and he replaced the posts as he had found
them. 4 ‘

The detectives looked across the river and up and
down it.

“Ten days after the event,” said Nick, “and, mean-
time, I believe there has been plenty of rain. \Ve’ve
seen all we can see here."

Chick agreed with him, and they went back to
Boston.

Only once did Nick say anything while on the
way.

“Brown was murdered by a blunt instrument.
That looks as if professional crooks were employed
on the job.”

The detectives had dinner at the Parker House,
where they read all the evening papers.

No account of the ﬁnding of Brown’s body gave
them any more information of importance than they
already possessed.

“I'll go out to Malden alone,” said Nick, when.

they had ﬁnished. “There’s no reason, though, why
you should be idle. It may be that the police have
information that they are keeping from the papers.
Better go up to headquarters and see Haley, or some
other of our friends there, and make them give up."
“I had thought of that,” responded Chick.

Nick then gave him some further instructions, and.

went to Malden.

In twenty minutes he was on the street where
Fielding lived. i

But he did not call on his friend.

‘When he had come to Fielding's house he passed
it.. ’

“Jim lives on one side,” he said to himself, “and
Professor Drummond on the other. Then, that
must be Drummond"s house.”

It was a large house, standing somedistance back
from the street.

Behind the house, and almost joining it, was a
large stable. I _

of vacant land around the house and stable, could be
seen in the half-darkness ‘of evening.,_-

no idea that a detective cared for any of the higher
p_roblems.” . I

The professor’s lips were parted as if he meant to
say more. Then he leaned again on the table, and
added:

“But I forget myself. You are here on business.
You mustn’t let me take you time from it."

“You are quite right, professor,” responded the
detective. “I must keep my mind on the Hawley
case, but sometime I should like to discuss these
other matters with you."

“Yes! yes!" said the professor, impatiently; “what
else do you want to know ?”

“Does anybody else live with the Hawleys ex-
cept their servants?"

“Nobody.”

“How many servants are there?”

“Six.” '

“Can you name them and tell what they do?”

“Yes,” and the professor did so.

“Were the servants fond of young George?” asked
Nick.

“Oh, yes; he was generally liked.”

“Sometimes it happens that a boy in a rich fam-‘
ily is especially fond of some one servant. Was this
the case here?”

“It was.”

Again the professor's eyes began ‘to glow wonder-
fully. V

That seemed to be a sign that his interest was
greatly aroused. A

“Who was ‘the favorite servant?” asked Nick.

“The Coachman. His nameis Wilson, and he was
wonderfully fond of the boy. He has been a changed
man since the death.” ' ‘

“Indeed! and since the robberyof the body? how
has he been since then?” '

The professor sat up. . ‘

“Very much changed!” he exclaimed, speaking
rapidly. ,, "You can't get a word out of him. He
used to talk all the time. Now he never says any-
thing. I see what you are driving at, Mr. Detect-
ive! ' It is a wonderful idea! I am surprised that it
had not occurred to me before.” ’! °

“Well,” said Nick, cautiously ; “the plainest things

“Quite true! and it’: the case now. Really, I seem

“Oh, yes——-something. I think I have made a lit»

_ “I'm mighty glad to hear that."

Nick looked keenly at his friend.

There was something in his tone that surprised '
him. V . _

are not getting sick over this Hawley matter.”

“No, Nick: but it does, seem maddening.”

“I can understand your friendly interest in it, but
why should you. give it so much thought?"

“I can't help it, living right next door and know:
ing all that goes on there. If Hawley doesn’t tell me.
his servants tell my servants, and so I am aware of
everything.”

“Then you must have a lot of information.”

Fielding hesitated.

along the street past Mr. Hawley’s until he came to
the professor's place.

Then he stepped across the street and stood under
some bushes that lined the sidewalk, and looked
across the house and grounds.

He had not tried to hide himself. Nick was sim-
ply thinking, but he noticed when a man passed him
that he was not seen, for the man went on without
turning his head.

Then he noticed that he had happened to choose
a place that was in deep shadow.

_ An are light threw strong rays on the gate to the
professor’s driveway just opposite, and lit up much
of the grounds, but the spot where Nick stood was
heavily shaded by a tree and the bushes.

Atlast Nick shook his head and was about to go
on, when footsteps approaching hurriedly made him
hesitate.

They were on the other side of the street.

A man was walking rapidly.

He passed under the are light, and Nick recognized
him. ' .

It was a man named Richard Tay1or—-a gambler,
swindler, would-be murderer, and perhaps a good
many other things as bad.

Taylor was the partnenof Guy Preble, now locked
up in \Vorcester and awaiting trial.

' When Preble was arrested, Taylor could not be
found. The two had apparently parted company be-
fore Nick began his operations in VVorcester.

And here he was within reach!

Nick was on the point of dashing across the street

to arrest him, but something made him pause.
It was the fact that Taylor took a key from his

pocket and applied it to the professor’s gate.

He opened it, the one that led to the driveway,
went in and closed it carefully behind him.

Then he hurried toward the house.

i» Nick could see that he did not go in by the front
door.

“Well,” thought the detective, “to-morrow will do
just as well, and maybe a great deal better. I know
where to find you, Dick Taylor, and I have some new
thoughts now about Professor Drummond.” '

He started now for the city. - M g

The twitching of the rope showed that the man
holding it was trying to turn his victim over.

Nick could not seetthe raised slab, but he was
keeping his’ head up as well as he could, anyway,
and when he heard the auto jolt as the wheels came ’
against the slab, he sprang upward as welfas he
could from his elbows and toes. L

NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

As he struck this sideways, he doubled up his legs
and then," pushing them. against the grassy bank,
sprang out from it with all his strength.

' I"t~was='enough to throw him forward a bit, and so
get a ‘slack in the rope.

Next instant the slack was taken up by the prog-
ress of the machine. . '

At the same instant the detective pulled back for
all he was worth. '

The sudden loosening of the rope and its quick
tightening again were enough to unbalance the man,
and Nick's hard yank pulled him completely out of
the auto. I —

The strainon the detective’s arms ceased at once;
but he slid overytlfe ground several feet‘ before he

_ rolled into the gutter and stopped.

Num-bed and almost unconscious he twisted the

noose from his head and !tried to get up.
‘ He fell down again, and, for a moment, had to
stay there on his hands and knees, getting his breath.

freely from his hands and face.
Of course, his clothes were torn in a dozen places,

He was hardly awﬁre of it, but he heard the auto -

Drawing it, he crawled, for he could not walk, in
the direction taken by the auto.

He had not gone more than thirty feet when he
came upon the body of a man.

The degactive placed his hand on the man’s heart,
and then pocketed his revolver.

“Dead!” he muttered.

He had to sit down aghin.

In all his adventures, he could not remember when
he had been so‘shaken up and exhausted.

After a moment he took out his pocket lantern.

Nick wanted a sight of that man’s face.

“I’d like to see the fellow who so nearly did for
me,” he thought.

He had to give that up. The ingenious little lamp
had been so ‘badly damaged that it wou.ldn’t work.

“Well.” said Nick, “hang me if you aren't worse,

off than I am.
else.”

Up to this time he had not been able to think very
clearly.

Now, his senses seemed to come back suddenly.
He felt more pain, but he also felt that something
must be done at once.

“Of course,” he reasoned, “this attempt to kill me
is connected with the Hawley mystery, which is no
longer much of a mystery to me.

“But there is a great deal, the hardest part of it,
in fact, to be done before I can face the father of
that boy and girl.

“This fellow here can tell nothing, but his face
may, and there may be things in his pockets that will
serve as clews.

I can see, if I can't do anything

“His confederate got away in the auto and is now"

whirling through the park.

“But he,—. or some other confederate, may come
back here to take away this body.
_. “I must first prevent that.”

He got to his feet and leaned against a shade tree
for a moment, wondering whether he would be able
to walk. -

After a moment he took hold ‘of the fence that
ran ‘beside the walk, and, clinging to it, made his way
slowly over the short distance to the corner. e

There was one house on that corner.

Accor-dingly Chick hurried out, and sent this tele-
gram to Patsy:

Take midnight train, and report at Maiden police station on
arrival.

Then he went out and spent the rest of the night
in front of Professor Drummond's house. ’

“I'm badly shaken up," said Nick, as he-bade him
good-night, “but I'm still in the ring.”

CHAPTQER VIII.
THE SECRET OF LIFE.

Early the next morning there was a strange scene
in Professor Drummond’s house. '
' It was in a room at the back on the second floor, a
large room, ‘with shelves along the walls.
P On the shelves were a great number of jars and
bottles of odd shapes such as chemistsuse.
V Some were ﬁlled with liquids, others with pow-
ders. ‘ e i

There was a 'larg‘e’sink, with water faucets and
tubes for gas. 7 y ' '

In the middle of the room was a long table, or
bench, slightly higher'at one end than at the other.

This had no coverf ' _

. Shortly after sunrise the professor came into this
room. , l
D For 5 long time, more than an hour, he worked
with his blow—pipes, powders and liquids.’ ', _ .

When he had ﬁnished he had a retort half full of a
brownish‘ liquid. ' ' ' ‘ ' ‘  '

He held it up to the light.‘

“The solV'exft‘!” he muttered, ex‘citedly';‘ “the ﬁnal
triumph after a" longlife ‘of study and experiment.
It will reveal‘ the secret of life! andthe time is at
hand when the great test will be made. How I shall
laugh at those who have mocked me 2”  i ”

He poured the liquid from the retort into a ﬂask
and éorned it ﬁrmly‘. ' “ ‘- ' A 7 e n

Then he placeilfhe/ﬂask on a shelf, withinieasyi
reach of the table; and took upfanothef ﬂask that

CHAPTER IX.
THE PROBLEM SOLVED.

Professor Drummond started back, with a gasp of
awful astonishment.

“Carter!” he stammered..,

Then he quickly placed his solvent on the shelf,
and caught up a scape] with one hand and the ﬂask
of powerful explosive that he called his “safety
valve,” with the other.

“Yes," said the detective, sternly; “Carter, and in
time, I hope, to prevent your 1ast,and foulest crime.”

He aimed his revolver as_he spoke.

“Dick! Dick Taylor!” called the professor.

But the assistant did not answer.

"Professor,” commanded Nick, “bring that girl
to her senses. You know better than I how to do it.
Get to work or this thing in my hand will speak for
me!” -

The professor held up his ﬂask at arms’ length.

“Shoot 1'’ he retorted, scornfully. “I will drop
this ﬂask. and the gas it contains will kill you in-
stantly.”

“Do you expect to escape it?” asked Nick.

“I? no! but what does it matter? If I live and
ﬁnish my work the secret of life’ will be made known
to the world. If you compel me to die, I shall take
my secret with me to the grave, and the worldwill
be the loser.” ’

“Then,” said Nick, “you and I may as well die ‘to-
gethei'.’_’ A 4 p . . I

With that he turned his weapon slightly and fired,

, The bulletwent through the ﬂask just below the
professor’s ﬁngers, smashing the neck and causing

the larger part of it to drop to the floor, where it
broke in pieces.

Professor Drummond’s astonishment paralyzed‘

him. A it ,
,“Why doesn’t it explode P" he asked, faintly.
Nick paid no attention to the question.

Placing the revolver on the operating table, where
he could reach it if needed,’ he bent over the’ motion-

Chick had such an article, and the man‘ was
promptly fastened to the other two. ‘

“‘What’s become of Taylor?” asked Chick.

I, f“He_ got away,” replied Patsy. “It couldn’t be
-helped. You see I was on the watch for the auto-
mobile down by the gate, but the rascal rode in by a
back road from the park. First thing I knew I saw
the stable doc; open. All four of ’em were in there.
They found Taylor where you had ‘left him, and they
cut his bonds. So he was free when I came up, and
while I was having a tussle with these fellows, he lit
out by a back door, and went off into the park."

:. “Well,” said Chick; “he’s of the least consequence,
for he wasn’t here when the body was stolen. These
areundoubtedly the ghouls.”

“Nodoubt of it.” '

watched his opportunity and when the professor left
the room for a moment, he took away the ﬂask and
put in its place one just like it in appearance but con-
taining a harmless liquid. '

In that hour of _ helping the professor, Chick
learned that not only was the body of Lucy Hawley
in the house. but that of George also.

Thus Nick’s suspicions were conﬁrmed. _

Patsy came through on the midnight train and ar-

» rived at the Maiden station about half-past six.

Nick got up then and they went together to the
Drummond house, where Chick let them in.

\/V hat followed is known, except that as soon as
Nick entered the professors operating—room Chick
telephoned for Dr. Metcalfe.

Fielding and many others were greatly shocked to
ﬁnd that their friend, the professor, was a lunatic.

They had supposed that he was “queer,”.but as
sane as anybody. It was perfectly clear, however,
that in studying on his scientiﬁc problem he had
lost his reason, and that he deliberately caused the
apparent death of George Hawley (which had be-
come real when the boy was embalmed) for the pur-
pose of making an experiment; and, while all the
facts cannot be fully known, it seems probable that
when the professor found that he was unable to re-
store George to consciousness, he made a new “sol-
vent” and determined to try it on the boy’s sister.

Speaking of the matter, Fielding asked Nick when
he first suspected Drummond.

“Well,” replied the great detective, “an unpleas-
ant feeling ﬂashed across me at your ﬁrst mention of
his name. So I went to Boston, half-suspecting him,
and for that reason had.C,hick look up his record. I
was almost sure he was guilty while I was talking
with him, and when I learned that Lucy had disap-
peared, I had no more doubt.”

It is hardly’ necessary to say that Mr. Hawley and
his wife were rejoiced beyond expression at the re-
sult of ;\‘ick’s work. They could do no less than
give him the big reward offered for the recovery of
the'boy’s body. and that sum, therefore, was Nick's
fee for the case:

The detectiveswere sorry that things happened so
that Dick Taylor escaped.

"But,” said Nick, “he amounts to little. He’s an
unusual crook, because he can’t do anything on his
Healways has to act as the tool of an
abler man.” ’

I THE END.

Next week's issue of this weekly (No. 278) will
contain “Nick Carter as a Mill Hand; or, The Fall
River Murder Mystery Revealed.” Taylor was still
at liberty. He soon turned up again, only to meet
his old enemy Nick again.‘ Quick work and plenty
of it was what Nick had marked out‘ for him. Read

“Yes," answered the farmer, “the whole neighbor-

“Praytell me the cause,” I aslttd. _

“Ploughing," quickly answered the farmer.

fused to do, saying it was good enough for a black boot-
black to have one boot blacked, and he didn’t care
whether the boot that the bootblack hadn’t blacked
was blacked or not.

This made the bootblack who had blacked the black
bootblack's boot as angry as a bootblack often gets, and
he vented his black wrath by spitting upon the blacked
boot of the black bootblack.

This roused the latent passions of the black bootblacl:
and he proceeded to boot the white bootblack with the
boot which the white bootblack had blacked. .

A ﬁght then ensued in which the white bootblack
who had refused to black the unblacked boot of the
black bootblack; blacked the black bootblack’s visionary

Waiting, for the Jailor.
(By C. Elmer ATrautner.)

At Indianapolis there is no regular jailor. A few
months ago a policeman took a prisoner to jail and being
unable to get admittance, requested him to wait until
he found the jailor. The man leaned against the fence
and waited for an hour. No jailor came. It was in-
tensely cold, and he grumbled outright.

His manners attracted some persons passing that way,
who inquired what was the matter. The poor fellow
said: .

“That darned oﬁicer told me to wait until he got the
key to put me in, and I’m nearly froze.”

p “Why don’t you leave?" asked three or Four at once.

“Can't; told bin: I would wait,” was the reply. '

By hard persuasion, the ‘crowd got him tobelieve that
it was not dishonorable to break his word in such a case,
and he left the inhospitable mansion.‘ l

How Esau sawed.
(By Howard Kanagy, Ill.)
An old farmer whose sons had all grown up and left

. home hired a young man by the name of Esau Buck to

help around the farm. On the eve of the day following
they hauled a load of logs up for wood. The next morn-
ing the old man said: ‘ L
“Esau, I am going to town to-day and while I am
gone you saw up the ‘wood and keep the ram out of the:
