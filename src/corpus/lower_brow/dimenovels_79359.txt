 _ s time in a dream Laﬁtte appears in the presence of a lady,
 urging her to get the lost jewels, gold, and silver. ‘
' After all these‘ years Doctor Beazly has at last consented

to have some one else who believes in theundertaking join ‘

7 ' V him to find the treasures, and they have made arrangements

satisfactory to all parties concerned, and now in a short ‘

time Mr. McKay, ’a banker, being the associate mentioned,
will begin operations»to ﬁnd’ the treasures stowed deep

At that moment a squall struck the ship,'and over she
went upon her beam-ends, everything cracking. ”
‘Topsails were already close-reefed, so the -captain
merely ordered the jib hauled down and the foresail

Tom stationed himself at the end of the jib*d0wn—
" haul, and did not pull with more force than an infant
might have done. This was noticed by the skipper; but
before he could say a word a roll ofithe ship caused the
men in front of the shirk to let go of the rope, when the
end of the downhaul, suddenly whipping upward, caught
around Capsheaf’s throat, jerking him into the bow;
A cracking sound was heard as this took place, and
‘ the shirk fell upon the deck, quite dead, with his neck
twisted in ,a singular manner. '
When the body was launched overboard there was, I

IA PRAIRIE EDITOR. j

 

 

BY AUGUSTUS W‘A'['I‘E'RS.

Many a'time, as I enter the magniﬁcent establishments
; of our New York dailies, the modest domicile of a young
‘ editor located for many years on an Illinois prairie arises
before me,» and creates that profound impression which

sharpness of contrast inevitably produces. Instead of a
magniﬁcent Hoe press, turning out ten sheets at a’ revo-
lution, or a Bullock press, which prints ten thousand
perfect copies in an hour; composing—rooms containing
an army of typos, and those marvelous “turtles,” that
roll about as instinct with life; editorial, stereotype, press,
I and counting—rooms, in which legions of employees ply
T their various branches-—the editor I speak of was his own
compositor, pressman, reporter, bookkeeper, and mail-
agent. The press had been conveyed all the way from
. Ann Street, New York, to the prairie alluded to, and was
scarcely any way in advance of the antediluvian'rna—'
chine on which Benjamin Franklin was fain to operate.
The “stands” were home—made, and the building which
sheltered them was one of those quaint adobe establish-
. nients which are still to be ‘seen in certain portions of the

West.

"Thertown, when the -editor ﬁrst appeared, was little
more than‘ a solitary’, rambling street, fringed with wood-
en residences and stores, with an extremely, shabby court-
house at one end, and a bridge leading overja canal at
the other. Half a mile from the center of the-village
‘ﬂowed the Illinois River, which in summer furnished a
goodly supply of fish, and in winter of delicious ducks.
Arid. oftentimes, in the midst of the heterogerious mass
observable in the printer’s sanctum, a collection of\prairie-
; hens aiid wild ducks might be seen in alarming juxta-
,\; position jfwith a keg of ink, a lye-pot, and the manuscript
editorials for the coming week. ‘ . I "

2', ‘But the impression produced upon’ the mind-of the
’ Writer by; thezscene presented on the night when he ﬁrst
entered" the Yeoman office will never be erased. An
exceedingly ~scra,wny young “sucker’.’ was ofﬁciating as
_'_devil, and manipulating the roller of the press, while the
. CliTC,<3r,,»with long hair ‘,an‘d2sl‘eeves~rolled up to the el-
',l;,;;yvs;;~.dexterously ‘ran off the~sn‘owy sheets. _But the
ost striking‘ and . unique : feature of -.th,e:-scene’ w.as,an

immense skull perched upon the top of the iron frame
of the press, and into an eye-hole of which a tallow
candle had been thrust.

A short time previously‘ a number of Indian skeletons
had been exhumed in digging the ‘foundation of a house,
and the editor had been happily presented at one and the
same time with an item and a curiosity. And thus, by
the strange whirling of time, had the head-piece of “L0!

the poor Indian” been transformed from a destroyer of

buffalos and fellow savages into an assistant of that
mighty engine, the modern press. I
As the Western Franklin rattled oﬂ’ the slim but lively
edition of his paper, a steady ﬁre of witticisms kept pace
with the regular ﬂap of the tympamsheet, and if a Yan-7
kee Boswell had been present in those days, many a good
thing that has long rested in oblivion might still be serv-
ing its term in the columns of the modern paragraphist.
Such concentrativeness has been rarely equaled asthat
displayed by this angular man, and though he arrived
. in Morris on the verge of "winter, incumbered with an
almost helpless wife, and with barely enough material to
fulﬁl the requirements of a newspaper-oﬂice, scarcely
two years elapsed before he had built himself a house,"
established a reputation as one of the most brilliant and
fearless of writers, and was regarded by the_ farmers and
hard-handed toilers generally as one of the most promi-
ising of Western men. ‘ -
The ‘only communication. the village then held with
the outer world was by stage—coach and canalgandr the
arrival in town of what was known as the “packet,” a
fast-sailing canal-boat, was regarded with as much con-
cern as New York would‘ note the heaviest European
steamer. In fact, this and the weekly issue "of the‘ Y eo-

man were the two great social events of the place, and, ,
furnished inexhaustible themes for comment, from the .

awe-inspiring justice of the peace to the poor" widow
who lived in a. log cabin and “suppox_'1ied,herself byher
pig and a potato—patch; ‘? ” " I "
' » Alike when the blistering sun of summer glared "upon
the prairies, or the tempests oflwinter howled‘ like'raven-

ing beasts, the editor continued to ply his multifarious’ A

callings. ,Mom, noon, and night he wasengaged in ready-

ing,.writing, or.type-setting, and often, when the rough ,

denizens of the Western town were locked in sleep,
I the grim disciple of Faust relieved the more practical la-
bors of the day with a tune upon his ﬂute, or a draft
from the _ immortal founts of Shakespeare, Burns, or

Byron; Many a wild prank, too, did he perpetrate, both ‘ _
’ qin and out of the editorial columns, whose memory still M =

lingers among the “oldest inhabitants.” Occasionallya

tramp-printer would make his appearance in the settle— ‘

ment, and during his few days’ sojourn in the printing-

olhce enough incipient romances would beset ‘aﬁoatto ‘ I

have stocked a dime—novelist for-years. According to
the “jour’s” story, there was no village between the Arc‘-

tic circle and the Straits of Magellanin which he-had 
not. exercised his indefatigable “stick," or. anvIndian_-set;
tlement that was not already provided with billiard+rooms,_'

and thriving journals. In fact, the momenthisrtongue
became loosened, and his “rule” fairly clicking away,"it
seemed to become a matter of-.perfect.indif£erence‘what

sort of statements he made, so long as his. audience raps] I :
peared tobe absorbed. The latter ‘consisted of the; smi-‘ ,
. ling editor, the red-headed‘apprentice; and . perehancejr.‘
