 CHAFTER ‘I.——The., Runaways.

.- “I don't like the looks of this house, nor the
 people in it, said Dick Appleton in a low.
guarded tone to his friend, Sam Atkins, as the
' «two sat at a common deal table, close to a window
,.overlooking_ a creek that jutted in from the Patap-
fszo River, a number of miles south of the city of
 Baltimore. “Pm sorry we stopped —here.j'
' H r“It can't *bé.helped now,” replied Sam, [with a
~»€£urtiye glance around at the -,hard-loolei.ng._-“-gliar-
acters, all of them evidently. sailors,-~who~'Were

‘ “Pin vpr_'ettyI.wel1 petered out ihyself,” replied
Dick, “but just the same I wish we hadn’t come
ihere," . _
“What are you afraid of, anyway?’ asked his
,com_ anion. “It isn't like you to show the white
fee/_, er.. I never saw you do it at school, no mat-
gr what theodds were agaihst you. Then, after

“Why shouldn't they, seeing that we’re_strang-’
ers? Besides, our presence here in this out-of:
the-way spot, hungry and footsore, must have"

struck them as rather odd.‘ “They heard you tell * 

the landlord, in "answer tcfhis qiiestion, that we're
on our way to Baltimore, and ’ll bet few people. i , N‘

shore on foot,when.ﬁ,t ere’s a railroad only a. few‘””—‘7

at~the rate of three cents a mile.” - , ,
f‘It isn’t anybody's business how we travel, or
what road we take to_ reach our destination,"
replied Dick‘. .
“That's right; but ‘we’ ‘can't prevent people be-
ing curious on the subject." ‘i
,‘‘It was necessary for us to take the most ‘im- , 
road in order to" ’

 

' Sam nodded. ’ N

“If we’d been caught and yanked back to the‘ "
academy, Doctor Titus would have seen to it that ‘  ;:
we would .ii'ot’on1y have ‘been punished severely, H
but that we wouldn’t have have hadyanotherp 
chance to give the school the slip."

“I’m not sure that we’re safe from capture , —
yet. ,Doctor Titus may have notified the Balti- 
more police to be on the lookout for us.”  

“I’m willing to take my chance with the Balti~'
more police. ' We, don’t intend to remain long *
enough inthe city for themto get a line on us.
If they're watching for us, it is at the railroad

. station.” - . i ‘ _

“They'll have a sweet time looking .for, us'’“ i
there,” grinned Sam. ~ . . = , . , '

At that moment Dick raised his eyes, and met, ’-
the ﬁxed gaze of a low-browed, ugl -looking chug ‘
who sat h himself at a small tallilefat the en ‘
of the sin 1 barn. . . ' \,

i terest the fellow seeined_to be taking in .them..

He would have called Sam’s.attention to’ it,’ butuj
was afraid his ncompanion would turn around
and lookat the man. _ 1  " ’

«-Just then the landlord appeared from a

 

 
 

 

 

 



    

    

 

 

  
    

‘~  in the rear of the room with a tray containing
’ " two plates, knives and forks, a dish of cold meat
a platter of bread, some butter, and two cups oi‘!
coffee. He unloaded these articles in front of
the boys and walked over to the bar to Wait on
acustomer who wanted some liquid refreshment.
, ‘The sight of the food cut short further conver-

 ’ sation between the boys for the time being, and
~with one accordthey transferred 9. Phrtion of
 the meat to their plates and began toeat like
. ‘ very hungry lads indeed. Dick noticed that the
’ ill-looking rascal scarcely took his eyes oﬁ’ them

‘ while they were eating. He had a bottle and a
t,mn‘blerain-front of him, and he -drank of the
contents of the former quitefrequently. The

D’  rest of the crowd seemed to have got used to‘

their ,presence—, and ceased to pay any attention
  to them. Eheglandlord, however, ad his eyes on

and bread in sight and ﬁnished their coffee. Then
' they sat back in their chairs feeling much better.
About this time a newcomer appeared on the
scene. He wore a ,cap and a rough pea-jacket,
had bushy side whiskers, and «an authoritative
air.. He stepped up to the bar, called for whisky,
. and drank it down like so much ‘water. After a
‘ brief conversation with the landlord he turned
' , to_the' crowd‘ and said in a hoarse, fog—horn
_. voice: -  » g -
“Come, my bullies, it’s time‘ you were shakin’
a leg for the schooner. We ‘drop down the creek
 v in twenty minutes. D’_ve understand?”
,‘ The men seemed to take his words in the iight
~ V of an order that was to be obeyed- They arose

'  gait, for the entrance. ’ ’ "

through the window at their elbows l_Di and
. ‘Sam saw‘ the crowd making their way own a
lane beside the creek. One man only, besides the
landlord, remained in the. public room. , This-was
the surly’-looking ‘fellow ‘who seemed to be so
_much interested-in the two boys that they more
than dhzided his attention with the rum bottle.
, Presently the landlord went to the door, step-
~ 3 ped outside, and walked over to a horse trough
, whichwasfed by a common 11-on pump set..on top
: i of a wooden base. He leaned against thegpump,

. ‘pipe -in mouth, and after looking up and down

that was hauled up alongside _a smallvwarf in the
creek about a quarter of a mile away. The boys
looked in that direction, too, through the window,
' following the movements of- the sailors who had
7 just, left the. roadhouse. They were tumbling
 aboard the vessel while the mate paused on the
wharf. Pretty soon the boys saw the schooner s

{ " 9 hustled them out of their bunks with blows‘ and

dead than alive. but the [sea air made them feel a

as weak as cats. The mate ﬁtted them out with

sea-going togs from the slop chest, took Dick into

in they were forced to hustle, and by degrees their

sickness left them and they were able to eat a
fairly hearty supper. ' ,_

 boys were gradually broken into routine life

aboard the brig. The mate, however, never lost a

chance to lay his rope’s-end on their backs, or

them for the blows they had given him that first

itself and returned to the shore. It looked as if_it
had been made by some ponderous mai-ine, animal, 
with a ﬂat belly, that had dragged itself up there‘
from the water's edge and then returned by 'a_"
parallel course. There was no doc to the hut, jus »
a narrow opening, through which the boys peered .'

 " CHAPTER VIII.—-The Stranded Schooner.
( ~ —The sun‘. was well fun when Dick opened his
eyes next. morning. Sam was still in dreamland,

‘ a few7feet away. Every square foot of the in-'
 ‘teirior of the rude hut was now discernible. Dick

.- saw that it contained quite an assortment of ’
 ‘nautical odds and ends, such as rope, blocks, a

kedge;anchor, rope-bound buckets, two_or three
large, shallow tubs, hardwood poles with blunt-

'l:'«:‘_, p'o_i'nted iron heads. and otherarticles, including

a;;ship’s lantern with part of a candle in it. It
looked more like a ‘storehouse for marine junk

, ‘ than a habitation. Dick walked outside and found
 1 his clothes and Sam’s as. dry as tinder, so he lost
' . no time dressing‘ himself. The surface of the
" sea had calmed down to a vast ﬁeld ofrippling

 

waves that reﬂected the sun’s raps with a daz-N

r zling glare. , V ..
v ' {A ‘gentle breeze whispered among the banana
_ trees in the grove behind, and on either side of
-the hut, andlightly rustled the leaves of the plan-
. tains and palms. The vegetation along the centre
 -,«o£_,the ‘island looked brightly green, While the
. beach lay hard and smooth and white. Taken all’
together, it was a pretty picture to the unaccus-
tQ1n‘ed'eyes of Dick“ As he looked around he spied
l_1I:scious=bunches_ of bananas ripenin 'iii the sun
-' . , din the shade of thelong,‘ pendent caves. The
; si ht of them made him feel hungry,‘ and he was
3 ‘ soon imunching the fruit with great satisfaction.
. hile hewas thus engaged Sam came to the door
 of, the but and looked out. He noticed Dick stand-
fﬂ ing a few yards away working his jaws over some-
v  ithing. 3 ‘ '
’ ' >v“I-Iello. Dick! What are you eating?” '
’ ,"“Bananas. There are enough around here to
feed a small army. Get into your clothes and

‘of plantain trees rising ﬁfteen" or" twenty feet in»

“Bananas are all right.in their way, b1'1t..we"
can’t live without drinking,” said Sam. ' .  ‘
“As this is _a~ti-opicalisland, we may ﬁnd some
cocoanut trees on it,” replied Dick, though''’lie' ''
wasn’t overconﬁdent-, for they had covered the» 
island already from end to end and had iioticed
nothing that looked like a cocoanut tree, as ,tl"iey ’
knew it ‘by ‘the pictures they hadseen in books.‘ _
Still they had traversed a part of the island" 
in the dark. and had not looked at the trees jwith
particular attention". They pushed into the plan'-
tain grove to rest under the shade of 'the‘1eayes‘,
when. to their surprise and delight, theyfcame
upon. a small natural spring which:‘ gushed ‘out of
a mass of solid rock. , ’ ‘ " I . .‘

He hadn't gone very far before he stopped 
short with a gasp of surprise. A dirty; weather-
beaten schooner was slowly approaching the
island under the, light breeze that then prevailed. .
Dick felt like shouting with joy, but restrained.
himself. and rushed back to the wreck and
around his chum. .

“What’s the matter? Time to" get up?” asked
Sam sleepily. .

“Turn out quick! There’s -a schooner close in .
shore! Here is the chance for us to get away
_,Afrom the island!"’  .
., Sam was wide awake inn moment. The news ,
.of a vessel close in shore bywhich they could
escapefrom the island made him as active in get‘-‘ ' ’
-ting into his garments,as a young nrfonkey. . As
soon as Sam was dressed_Dick piloted him to the
place zwhencehe could catch a view of the vessel.‘

“Glorv hallelujah!” shouted Sam- f‘We’ll get — ,

“How did the money come to be (‘in the shore?”
Fl_orence asked, clearly astonished at such a cir-
cumstance.

“We found itiin the midst of the wreck of an i

old vessel which must have come ashore on the
island sixty or more years ago,” replied Dick.

“Dear me! How funny!” she said. “Are those
bananas?” she asked suddenly, pointing toward
thegrove. « ' _
’ “That's what they are. That reminds me that
Sam and I haven’t had our breakfast yet, and I
suppose you’re half starved, too?” ‘

“Yes, I am quite hungry, though I had plenty to
eat aboard the yacht.”

“You wouldn’t mind eating something, would

" “That money knocked all thoughts of breakfast
out of my head. I guess we'd better eat before
resuming work.” ' .

« . “I think so, too. Start a ﬁrein the stove.

’*‘ There are ﬁsh and mussels enough left to make a
meal for all of us.” , _ ~' _ ~
Sam built_ a ﬁre and Dick acted as chief cook.
In half ‘an hour they sat down on the sand "to
their rude meal, and Florence declared that the
fish tasted. ﬁne, all things considered. They topped
their repast off with bananas, and after washing
the pans and dishes the trio ‘started for -the old
wreck. -Although one good shovel would have-
done the business better than half a dozen bozkds,
still the boys found their rude implements a great

’ improvement over their hands, and they were soon’-

making the loose-‘sand ﬂy. At first, no golden

’ . - vpiecesappeared to gladden the hearts of the boys.

~ They had to get rid ‘of the sand they had already
sifted of its precious freight. ' '

‘ The first piece of . money appeared ﬂying

through the ‘air as Dick tossed a boardful of sand

V . a yard or two. away. Florence saw it shining in‘

.- _'-the sunlight and ran after it. After that the
hoy'_diggers‘ grew more careful, -and soon the

, coins
 ‘ﬁrovided for their reception. Perhaps ﬁfty pieces

' ad been «turned into the pot when Dick’s board

remains o a stout ‘box were revealed. _‘Fui-ther

There seemed to the no doubt’ aboutthat, and the
boys had the'pot filled to the brim with money in

' “Carry it around to ‘the hut,‘%'am, -and dump it,

V ’ "‘No," said Will. “Keep it. Something tells

seemed to fade away from the hand of’ the
Hindu, and everything else faded with it.

him when the order came to tell of the pictures
in the light. ' ' - V i.

This was after- the fakir had played a melan-

minutes.

“Tell! Tell!” he said in low, earnest tones.

All this time the fakir’s audience had been

Ben Boltonwas nervously anxious. Examiner
Daycock regarded the leaping ﬁre with a skep-
tical sneer, and once he whispered to Ben that
it was “all blame nonsense,” only to be angrily
ordered to “shut up." But Nellie Tighe had all
she could do to keep awakeand this in spite of
a deep sense of fear which began to creep over
her. That the woman was half hypnotized her-
self there can be little doubt.‘ _ ‘

Then Will began to talk! amid those strange
surroundings his voice sounded to all like the
voice of one speakin far away. It is probable
that the fakir intenged this to be so, and that
this peculiar effect was also due to the exercise of
his owerful will. _ V

“ see diamonds!” said Will, speaking" in ‘low,
measured tones. “Oh, how they sparkle and
glitter. They lie in open papers upon a table.

The frozen body of a mammoth, preserved from T
decay by ice, has been found by Professor Petaff.
of the Leningrad Academy of Science, on the
bank of the River Amur in Eastern Siberia. ,
The professor estimates it is’ from 20,000 to
30,000 years old and hcﬁes to arrange to transport . *

covered, the first on the Lena River in northeast
Siberia, in 1729, which had been partly devoured
by wolves and bears. The second also was found

in northern Siberia, about twenty-five years ago. ;

The skeleton of the first is now in the Lenin-
grad Paleontological Museum. ’When the second;
mammoth was discovered, scientists tasted. thew
20,000-year old steaks and found the meat,-fresh,
but rather strong in ﬂavor.’ The air still 
maining in the. lungs showed no chemical
ference from the air of today.

‘Rattlesnake Farm In Texas‘

 

Snake farming is not so bad a businessﬁas one
might suppose. F. B. Armstrong of Brownsville,
Texas, has been at it*for twenty-ﬁve years and
has made big money «by it.

He handles and raises. the most venomous rep-

, tiles known to the Southwest and Mexico.’ ,Rat-

tlesnakes are his specialty. He handles thou-
sands of them in the colirse of a year.
Snake farming‘ i-s in‘ a class by itself.
Armstro has no competition in the business.
'l';’r_a.ctically all the rattlesnakes and other reptiles
peculiar to this region which are found in the
tmuseums, circuses,' side shows and public parks

.- ' of the United States and Europe are furnished
by him.

"He also does a good business withsnake charm-
ers._ He sells the snakes by the pound, receiving

it .all the way from 50 cents to $1 a pound, accord-

ing toguality and variety.
The snake farm is situated just outside of
Brownsville.’ It embraces about twenty acres of

ground and is surrounded by a strong, tight fence.

‘Upon a slight elevation within the main en-
closure are the pens pr corrals where the danger-
ous varieties are kept. _ Although this is the dull
season at the farm. there are more than five hun-
dred rattlesnakes in one pen. l_‘ \‘

The pen is formed by building. a tight ‘board
.fence. about ﬁfteen feet high. The ._fcnce has no
opening and the pen is entered by a ladder.

Twelve specil-is of poisonous snakes are known
These are the harlequin,

tlesnake,_ the banded .1-attlesnake, the dog-faced
rattlesnake; the prairie rattlesnake, and ‘the green
rattlesnake.‘ These snakes, with the exception of

T ..the harlequin, are all known by a peculiar mark

in’ the form of a. pit ‘In the skin of the upper jaw,

 between the eye and the nostril, and forming a
~ triangle with tl'le>~:Il0St1’ll, the eye and thepit for

the three corners. . p .

Mr. Armstrong has had specimens of nearly all
kinds of poisbnous snakes in the pens upon his
farm. He keeps the snakes in the pens to fatten
them. They bring better prices whenfat, as he
sells them by the pound. ‘

Rats and mice are their principal/food. T 'e
rodents are brought to Mr. Armstrong by Mex-
ican boys," and are placed in‘ the pens, and the__
snakes do the rest. Having gorged themselves

_ with the squealing,’ squirming «rats and mice the
 snakes retire tovthe holes which they have made
. " for themselves under the brush and lie there until

the meal is digested."

Th 'sma.l'l.incl0sure keeps the snakes ‘inactive

‘ land, they fatten ‘very rapidly. When in prime coi'i- -
T ‘dition? they are ;‘removed_ from the pen by means
of,a—wire4las.so hitched‘ in a tight nooseiaround

~.In extracting the poison the snakeis ‘made to
bite on a glass tumbler. The fangs dare fortlsri
and the poison is ejected into the glass. Then
the fangs are removed. ' ' « 3 '
‘There -are from six to eight fangs in each
snake. They are from one-fourth to one half
inch long and are curved and as sharply 
as a needle. In ‘the end of each fang is 'a‘:s_mal
