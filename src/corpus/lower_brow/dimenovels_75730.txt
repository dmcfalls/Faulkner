When the dessert was served Nat took up the

  

I‘l1'read 

paper and read the account of the burglary of Mr. - o

-QMerwin White’s home. .
“The man who called -on me with-the bonds:

it represented himselfas Merwin‘ White. and as the

securities were ordinary negotiable ones I took his

word for"it. He had a memorandum showing that ' "

the original owner of the bonds had‘ disposed-‘of
them to'Merwin White.- ‘I have ‘nodoubtthat the ;

was the thief, or his confederate, I c‘ou'ldn’t'say,

her only son, and whatever he did was all right

much solace. " ‘-
Shortly after dinner he started for the residence
of Merwin 3White on Fifth Avenue.
“Is Mr. White in 7” heasked the ‘servant who
answered his ring. - ' ‘
He was told that the gentleman was at home. '
“I should like to see him. Hand him my card,”
and Nat gave the man his business card. '

He was asked in and shown into the parlor.

The servant soon came back and told _.Nat to‘
follow him. . ’

He was taken to Mr. White’s library, a hand-
ls)omkely furnished room on the second ﬂoor at the »

ac . V ‘

That gentleman was attired in a smoking jacket
and slippers, had a cigar in his mouth, and a
‘newspaper in his hand. ‘

He gotup as Nat advanced into the room.

“To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit ?”
he inquired in a familiar tone. .

Before ha f the se nce was out of his mouth,
Nat was s he at hin in some astonishment.

He recognized the gentleman as the visitor who
had called at his office that day and commissioned
him to sell the D. & G. bonds.

“I beg your pardon, sir, but I guess the errand
I called upon was unnecessary,” he said, feeling
greatly re ieved to ﬁnd that the nian who had re-
presented himself as Merwin White really was
that person.

“Unnecessary!” said the gentleman, pleasantly. ,

“Yes, sir; for I recognize you as the gentleman V
who called at my oﬂice to-day and got me to sell
the ten D. & G. bonds, and I dare say you recog-
nize me as the’ young broker who ﬁgured in the
matter.”

“I called at your oﬂice to-day!” ejaculated Mr.
White, with a puzzled look.

“You will pardon me for suspecting that I had
been imposed upon,” said Nat, not noticing the
gentlei‘nan’s remark, “for fifteen, minutes after
you went away with the money I saw an account,

in the paper of a robbery that had been committed ‘ V

at the residence of a Mr. Merwin White, and in

the list of stolen articles wrerevmentioned the very, ' ’,

When he reached home he. told his mother that

he had ﬁxed up the ‘bond matter with the owner

of the securities‘ and would not have to make good
their price.

_ «He said nothing about ‘the White fami1y’skel— i

eton, consequently his mother remained in ignor-
ance of the true facts of the case. ~ »
He told her not to say-anything to his father

. about the matter, as things had been so arranged V
that his slip—up was not likely to become known

to his disadvantage. Next morning at breakfast
he told his father about the incident in a general
way, leaving him to believe that he had not actu-

ally fallen into the ‘trap Alfred White set for;

him. Of course he was careful not to intimate
in any way that hisyoiﬁce visitor and the gentle.

“If I were buying for myself, and wanted it
bad enough I might close with you; but as Pm

acting for another, under his instructions, I can-' ‘

not oﬁ'er_you more than he’s willing to give.” .
“Did you bring the money to pay for the stock?”
“I brought a check.” ,
“I wouldn’t take a check.” , '-
“It’s certiﬁed by the paying teller of the Man-

hattan National Bank, that makes it as good as

cash, for the bank guarantees payment.” ,
“That different. Let me see the check."

Nat showed it to him. The old man first '0

scanned the signature and then remarked:

“This is only good for $40,000,” he said.

“I know it. I have $2,000 in cash in my pocket
to add to it.”

iéWe1l, you can have the shares, though I think?’

I’m a fool for selling at less than 43.” _

“How can you be? You are getting $3,000 more
than the market price.” I

“I know it; but the price might rise higher
than 42 in a day or two.” .

“It might and again it might not. It’s all a
lottery, the market is. The stock closed today at
39. Well, if you want to make $3,000 easy and
still have 1,000 shares of Westchester Traction,

all you need do is to hand me your shares and '

take this check and the $2,000 cash. Then in the
morning go straight to Wall Street and buy 1,000
sh:.r<:s”of Westchester Traction at 39, if you can
e i . , ‘
g “That’s so. I didn't think of that. It’s a gobd
idea, but I don’t want any more stock. I want
the money. I’ll get you the certiﬁcate, and that
will let me out of the stock business for good.”
The old man got up and walked slowly out of
the room into an adjacent one.

N t handed him the check and the $2,000 in
money. The old man turned the two $1,000 bills
over in his ﬁngers’, looking at them carefully.‘ ‘

“Here what's this?” he exclaimed. .l“This onef ‘ ;

6 “Maybe so——maybe so,” said the old man; “but
I don’t like it. Thatmark looks like blood, and
r .1 hate blood. It’s shaped like a cofﬁn, too. Ugh!”
“You'll have to accept it, as I haven't another
to exchange for it. You can put it in your bank
* tomorrow. The bank will take it and probably
send it to W:.'.shin;3:oon to be redeemed for a new
one,” said Nat, who thought nothing of the cof-
ﬁn-shaped strip of deep rrarl paper that held the
two pieces of the note together.
_ The old man kept looking at it as if he didn't
like it and did"«’t want to take it as part payment_
for the certiﬁcate. _
,, “.I’l,l-'te.ke it if you promise to bring me a brand
new one tomorrow, and take this ‘one away,” he
said reluct'\nt~ly. “I don’t want a bill like thatin
the house.” . ' . 
“I will if you insist, but what's the use? You'll
have to deposit that check for collection in your
-_ bank, and you can deposit both notes with it. Why
' should you keep them about the house? They're

} too large to be readily‘ changed, and a thief might
...get« in here and rob you of them.

It's fcolish to,
take an chances when there is no need of it." '

“I will do as you say,” replied Mr. Brett. ‘‘I
[will nut, the check and the two notes in my safe
till the morning and then I’ll deposit them in the
bank where I have a small account, but I don’t
like banks. Thov fail and then’ycu lose most of

. “Certainly,” replied Nat, proceeding to do so.

“New notice how it is repaired. so there will be
no mistake about it if I have to return it to you.
See, there is asstencil mark across the red papgr.
What does it say?”

“Washington Trust Co.,” replied Nat, looking
at the stencil closely. “The same stencil is on the
other bill. too. That proves how good both are.”

money, put the certiﬁcate in his pocket, wished

“Well, Nat, what 1uck?” he asked the boy.

“I’ve got the stock, sir, but I had to pay 42 for
it. In fact, Brett wanted 43.” ’

“That’s all right; but isn't it singular that the
you put the
deal through?” -

“Yes, it is.”‘ .

“‘It would seem as if the burglars were aware
that he had received a large sum of money at
an hour that precluded him from depositing it in
the bank.” .

“The certiﬁed check won’t do them any good,
for I stopped at the .bank before I came here and
had payment held up.” ' .

“I know you did, for I ’phoned the bank on«the
subject -myself, and was told that you had just
been there on the same errand. The raséals got
the $2,000 in cash,,however.”

“Yes; but as one of those notes was mended in
a peculiar manner, and I have furnished the po-
lice with a full description of it, even to its num-
ber, it may lead to their detection.”

“I hope it will, for their crime was a most out-
rageous one. Did you bring your statement with
you. »

“No, I’ll send it to you some time today."

“Do so.” i '

As there were a number of persons in the ante-,

simply sorry for my brother—and myself.”
Excusing himself a moment or two Mr. White

left the room. When he returned he accom-

panied Nat to the hall-door himself and took

leave of him. As the young broker turned down . 
.the street, a man, attired in a pilot jacket, with»  ’

his hat pulled well down to his eyes, came out of

the area and followed him. The man was close 
»behind him when he turned down a side street

tcward’Madison Avenue, but Nat did not seem
aware of his presence. Although it was not yet

terg o’clock the street was quite‘ deserted. The " A 
man put his hand in his pocket, drew out a slung-V

shot and crept upon the unsuspecting lad. As

he raised his arm to strike, Nat stepped on one "
of the iron covers that protected the hole of 21., ~

coal cellar. A dog, perhaps, had dropped apiece

of fat on it, for the boy’s foot slipped and he _V’' 2

half fell just as the weapon whizzed through the

air. The result was it missed his head and struck 

him a glancing blow on the shoulder, suﬂicient to
attract his attention to the action of the mlin.
Taking thes tranger for a footpad, Nat sprang at
him, and they went down on the sidewalk in a
heap. The man uttered a deep imprecation as
the weapon fell from his ﬁngers, and he grappled

with the boy. Nat, however, was strong and ':

wiry,‘and as agileas a young-monkey. He se-

cured a good hold on the fellow’s chest and held‘

him down in spite of his efforts to throwhim off.

' would be useless, as the man appeared to be a

ﬂeet runner. .

“I’m sorry he got away,” muttered Nat, in a
tone of dis2;ppr‘.intment. “Such scoundrels as he
belong in jail.” ‘

Spying the slung-shot Nat picked it up.

“That’s a wicked weapon,” he said. “An iron

‘ ball covered with closely wound cord, and at-

tached to a handle. A blow from that would
easily fracture. a person’s skull. I had a narrow
escape. Had I been knocked out he’d have got
away with the $1,000 note. That would have been
a great pity, though when he tried to change it

~. he’d have found/himself up against a bunch of

trouble. He is doubtless known to the police, and
would have been suspected ‘as one of the men who
killed Abel Brett. All things considered he may
thank his stars that he failed in. his design on
me.”

By this time Nat had reached the corner and
had but a short distance to go to his home.‘

“That's my name,” replied the boy.

“Mr. Merwin White recommended me to call on

. you as he said you were a smart young broker.

My name is Frank 1)unn, and I want, to buy 100
‘shares of A. & C. stock on margin.” _

“I’can buy it for you,” said Nat, drawing one
of his blanks toward him, ﬁlling it out and hand-
ing’ it to the customer to sign.

“You require $1,000 deposit, I believe?“ >

“Yes, sir———$10 on each share.” ‘

“Will you accept Mr. White’s check for $1,200,
and let me have the difference in cash?”

“Did you have it certiﬁed?” ‘

“No”; is that necessary?” _ _

turn it right over to the police, and put them

. CHAPTER IX.—Another Family Skeleton. 

The man who was clearly chasing the girl,
stopped when he saw Nat and recognized him.;. He’
seemed undecided what to do, and glared furi-
ously at the boy. . '

“What’s the trouble, miss?” asked Nat, who‘
wondered if the girl could be connected with Mer-
win White’s family. / e
_ “l'lI‘ake me away. Please do,” she cried, hyster-‘
ica y. ~
N“You must tell me what is wrong first," said’

at.

“Please take me away or that man will 
me back to the room where_I have been conﬁn,
a prisoner for weeks.” *' . L

“Conﬁned a prisoner in that‘ housel"rci'-ied Nat,
in a tone ‘of astonishment. “Why, this is the
residence‘ of Merwin White. Why should 
‘be kept a prisoner in his house? Surely, not with
Mr. White’s knowledge and consent.” . '

“It is he who is holding me a prisoher until;

’ “Mr. White hbducted you!” cried the amazé
Nat. “Impossible! Mr. White is a gentlemai'i~‘~'
“A entlemanl” cried the girl, feverishly. “ e‘
is a wicked man, and the chief of others as bad
as himself." . » -_ ,.
At that point the man whom Nat recognized
as a rascal advanced and said: _ i
“This girl is out of her mind. Don't believe“

i a word she says. She is Mr. White’s demented

daughter, and he keeps her conﬁned to the mo ,
in the top of the house rather than have her
go to a private mad-house.” - ,

“No, no,’-’ cried te girl, rfrantically. “He '_
lying. Don't let him_take me back. I have tod
you the truth.” '*

Nat felt that he was placed in an awkward
dilemma. If what the man said was true, and
it did not look unreasonable; he felt that he 
no right to interfere in the matter; but his
suspicions were, nevertheless, aroused by the
presence in Mr. Merwin White's house of the
rascal who had attacked him on his way home
the night previous. Why should Mr. White hat-.
bor such a man in his home? It must be bi:-‘
cause the capitalist was unaware of his true
character.

The boy felt that the gentleman ought tohe
warned against him. Doubtless the fellow Wis
there in the interest of Alfred White, who rob-
ably had further designs on his brother. While

' these thoughts were ﬂashing through his braih,

another man, who seemed to be ‘a servant, api-
peared from the area door. _ '
“Is Mr. Merwin White at home?” asked Nat,
still undecided how to act. V , .’ ~

“Yes,” said the man above. “Are. you Nat

I am."

“Then he is waiting. for you in the library; >

Bring his daughter up with you.” -
‘?I'm not his daughter. If.you won’t save
let ‘me go.” ‘, 

She tore herself out of Nat’s grasp andﬁe
across the street,’ pursued by the man who’
come out of the area. The fellow caught-
and with a scream she fainted in hisanﬁs.
Catching her in his arms he brought her A i,

'doing something he crept up the stairs and

' "into the dark passage and listened. The

‘use seemed to be wrapped in perfect silence.

" (I ventured out of the cellar altogether. Try-
.. the first door at hand he found it led into
1 .-kitchen. It was a long, low-ceiled room, dark
with smoke and age. A table stood in the center
it, on which stood a lighted lamp.

Twoof the men who had assisted in his cap-
ure were seated at it playing cards for stakes.
Nathad only opened the door a couple of inches,
and -he ‘closed it quickly and quietly. He was
'/the point of returning to the cellar to .put
nxanother waiting spell, when it struck him that
there were other ways of getting out of the house.
‘The’ next door led into the main hall with the
destairs near at hand. The hall door was
" fore him some yards away.

‘if the key is in the lock I can get out with-
. _ou_t¥ waiting longer,” he told himself, his heart
heating with excited anticipation.

C "A. dim light burned in a lamp‘ han ing from

out; talking. .

things that had heretofore puzzled him. ,_
“Neither name is his right one, for I’ have,

Brood, and that he has been conﬁned in’ an Eng‘:-
lishprison for many years, for forgeries com
mitted in London’? ‘ M; _

‘ “Great. Scott! Is that so?" cried Nat, asyth
recollection of. Broker Gr/eene’s story of the Afus
tralian crook ﬂashed ,across his mind. ~ 5
 “Yes, it is so," replied Edith Brooks, and th
she ‘explained how she had» learned all the fore
going facts from time to time while under 
in the Fifth Avenue house. There ‘were two
three points, however,’ whichdid not seem“to'iﬁ_
with the girl's, story. One of "them wiasjthe-:.

' “That’s true/’_admitted _Nat.'.‘* V  f

The~other point that required explanation air‘

i the ‘statement of Joe Millet-——‘—'that he ‘had’ seen?

man on Broad Street similar in ev‘ery*respect?_ V
White, at the very. time that White was in :Nat_ ‘
oiﬁce. It struck the young broker that" Joe, 
have erred about the exact time, which was ‘r ‘ ‘~
the case, though Miller_ne,ver( would ‘admit’
when subsequently‘ questioned on the subject.
length Nat woke’ up to the reality of his positio”
and striking, a match s‘/aw.b,y his watch’ that
was close on to midnight. 7
i “We must get away from this house,_ Mis
Brooks,” he said.  *-
“Do you thinkwe can?” she asked eagerly;
' “Put on your hat and jacket, and we will mak

tured myselﬁ’ he replied resolutely.

While she was getting ready Nat stepped out
side the door and listened for any sounds the...
would indicate the whereabouts of the rascals-;i:’r;
the house. The mansion, however, was as stilla '
though uninhabited.’ Taking the girl byvthe ban

iheiled her “down the carpeted stairs to the ﬂoio

below. , Then itwas that he heard conversation

' one of the rooms, and saw a bright light stream

ing under the door. Looking through the keyhole:
Nat saw Laban Brood, the rascal who had ma
queraded as the White twins, sitting at aitabl ~
with half a dozen rough-looking chaps, am;on;.g*‘
whom the boy recognized the man who had as
saulted him on the street, and also the rascal who?

They were drinking, smoking and playing card
around it large table, quite unconsicious that the.’
two most important prisoners were at libert
and in the act of “flying the coop.” , ~ ’
With great caution Nat led Edith down
main ﬂoor and over to the front door, the key
which stood in the lock. It was the work of 
a few moments‘ for thorn to get outs'id,e1i'n.

there was no means of ‘scaling the’front{,jW

and, tell our stories," said Nat; “and I hope we
shall soonfhave the gang behind the bars.’
""'l'hey walked nearly to the elevated station be-
forethey met with a policeman, and he directed
them to the police station, where they arrived
’ .9; quarter of an hour later. The story they had
I to tell rather surprised the captain, who happened
  in the place when they arrived. The cap-
in lost,no time in making his plans for raiding
 _e old Waite. mansion. A patrol wagon was
. ﬁaded with officers and started oil’, N_,at going
,fwith them, while Edith was put in charge of the
”ﬁatron of the station for the night. Nat led the
 to the rear of the grounds, as the easiest
point of entry to the place, and they were soon
the front door. It was open just as Nat had
‘ t it. The officers marched softly upstairs to
’ the scond ﬂoor, and then, as arranged, the boy
v opened the door and walked in alone. His ap-
 rance proved a great surprise to Laban Brood,
gs well as the others. / .
7 “How did you get out of the cellar, dear boy?”
//asked the rascal, masking his real feelings under
it suave smile.
i "I walked out, Mr. Brood,” replied Nat, with a
  "smile.
. At the mention of his real name, Brood sprang
Tfrom his chair, and a dark look came over his
face, while a smothered imprecation rose to his
‘ ips. N
. .“Don’t get excited, Mr. Brood, alias Merwin
~ and ‘Alfred White. Take things coolly. Your
. . ‘game is up and you might as well give up without
v {baking any trouble.” ‘ l .
-~ " ‘Thus speaking Nat threw open the door and
"She officers sprang into the room. The bunch
were taken off their guard, and were easy victims.
While they were being handcuifed, Nat went up-
; stairs and investigating the different rooms found
~ _ rs. Bunn asleep in one’of them. awoke her
f and told her that the crooks had en captured
and’~the.mansionv was once more in her charge.
“Nat then rode back to the stationhouse with the
. ﬁrisoners, most of the cops being obliged to walk

torappear at the police court in~the morning Nat
2» took a train and went home. When the prisoners
" were arraigned for their examination before the
magistrate, Nat, Edith and Mrs. Bunn testified
_ against them. The latter pointed Brood out as
1 the burglar whose face she had seen the night the
‘mansion was entered and Abel Brett murdered
»and‘robbed. The whole bunch were held for the
 action of the Grand Jury. They were subsequent-
ly tried and got their just deserts. The news-
‘, papers made a sensation out of the rounding up
lgﬁi the crooked gang, and the clearing up of the
.mystery which had surrounded the assassins of
,old Brett. Nat got most of the credit for the
2 capture of the crooks, and Wall Street could talk
V» qxflittle else than the exploit of the young broker
‘whose motives in cutting loose from his father,
and. setting himself up as an independent trader,
yes such a puzzle ‘to, them all. Nat took Edith

V CHAPTER XVI.
How Bob I-Ioodooed the Pretty Typewriter.

.‘_‘Well, how is it that you were never so ca"r;e-

He had no love for Bob, for he had suffered
even worse than young Blakesley had.» ’ He had
broken a big toe after being hoodooed by Whit!
don. ‘ , * .

“Say, Jennie,” he said to her, “is that messeri
ger boy your steady company?”  _

“Why, no, sir. I have no steady company at allig
Our homes are within two bloclgs of each other;
and being acquainted, it is only natural that we
should meet in coming and going. The truth is,
I asked him to help me to get rid of the atten
tions of Mr. Blakesley, and e volunteered to es-
cort me to and from my home. I never dreamed
of there being so much gossip on account of it.’," 

“Well, I'm sorry you are mixed up in it as you

about his business, and maybe that will put a stop
to it.” i V .

“Mr. Mason, I won't hurt his feelings, because
I went to him for assistance, and he promptly»,
rendered it. Besides, he is a polite and well-be '
haved. youth." ' - ' ' '

“All right. But he was only recently a boot.-'-.
black, and if you let him go with you, you will
hear» a good deal more talk.” ' g .  »

“Oh, you can't stop the talking. They mus!
have something to talk about. For a while the
talked about you having been hoodooed. I don
int<ind,to let them force me to treat Bob ungener-
ous y.’ ‘ , 

“All right; then. The next thing you know the
story will get into the papers. I hear that«Blakes-
le is threatening to thrash Bob, and you know
w at capital the reporters will make of it.  

She merely laughed. She was a great believer
in young Whiddon, and remarked: - *

“Several have attempted to thrash Bob, but‘!
haven’t heard of any one succeeding at it yet, sir.
I don’t believe that Blakesley has the grit to at-
tack’ him.”

That was an unfortunate remark of hers, be-
cause Mason lost no time in repeatin it to par-
ties whom he knew would take it to B akesley.

He very much hoped that Blakesley would give»
Bob a good thrashing. ~ '

Naturally the remark irritated Blakesley not a“
llittle, and had the effect ofprecipitating a col-
ision. ~

In the afternoon of the next day they met in _
the corridor accidentally, when a mix-up followed, '
with the result that Blakesley got a pair ofpblack ’

eyes and a bloody nose, while Bob received one

blow on his ear, which left no mark.
Just as Mason had predicted, the reporters got
hold of it, and an extremely lively and amusing V
story was published. ‘ , »
»The pretty typewriter was alluded to several
times, but her name was not iven. - .
Blakesley wore a pair of lack eyes for ten ‘
days, a standing advertisement of young Whiti-
don’s powers. " ,,
One day when Bob waited for Jennie at the foot
of the stairs she nearlyitook his breath awayyby
saying: . - ”
“Oh, Bob, they’ve got a wonderful story go’ ,3‘
' “Well, what is it-—somethiiig ,new_?”  .

15,000 CYPRIOTES ROAM ABOUT AS ,
PEOPLE WITHOUT A COUNTRY .,

The unhappy plight of the “man without at
country” seems to be multiplied many timesing
the case of Cypriotes, as the natives of Cyprus
are called in Egypt, and that entirely withoutz,
any fault of their own. It will be recalledthat
Cyprus formally was annexed by Great Britain
at the outbreak of the war with Turkey, in No-
vember. 1914, and in that act all the inhabitants
of the island were made British subjects, There
were and are to—day in Egypt, however, about’
15,000 Cypriotes, for whom no provision was
made in‘ the act of annexation.‘ ,

For a dozen years they have occupied an equiv:
ocal position, not having renounced their al-
legiance to Cyprus, and yet not being recognized
as subjects of the new sovereign of that island.
Now the Egyptian government puts them in an

 
   
    
  
        
   
      

  
  
   
 
   
  

   
   
    
   
  

    
  

that , they either become Egyptian ‘subjects or
citizens or else quit the mountry as undesirable‘
aliens. -' ' " ' g

The Cypriotes have sent a delegation to London
to appeal to the,British governfnent for itspro-‘r
tection, assuming that if it extends its _citizeIi'-’;i_
ship to them, as it did to the actual residen‘
of Cyprus, they willbe enabled thus tor'ren'i_ai;;1
