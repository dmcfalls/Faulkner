CHAPTER I.
' "A' _LETTER FROM A NIHILIST.

 “jAi-man to see you, sir,” said Joseph, entering the de-
,‘teetive’s study after a discreet rap against the panel of
thedoori; and when Nick raised his eyebrows in surprise
‘at’ the unusual form of announcement, Joseph added:
A i“He is evidently a messenger for another person, sir;
servant, I should say he is.”
,“Where is he ?” asked the detective.
,“In the reception-room, sir.” i
‘i will go down ina moment.” _ 
L _.Later, when Nick entered the reception-room, he
 himself confronted; by a short, stolid individual
"V‘\_?_hjori1_”_Iosepl1’s words had quite thoroughly described.
Stolidity, irnperturbability, dogged obstinacy, and not
frgtertiauch intelligence were the noticeable characteristics
fihis face.” » \ T A
‘ i,fWell, sir?” said the detective, as the man came toward
 when he entered the room. He held a sealed en-
lope in his hand, which, however, he did not at_once
ﬁe: to the detective. .if V V J‘
"divas directed first to make sure that I was address—
 ‘M1’. Nicholas _Ca;rter,_”.he said, in a curiously imper-

 

    
 

sonal voice, which was as nearly devoid of expressioi
as a voice could be. ' - ’

“I am he," replied the detective. “I am Nicl<*Carter.~'

»..“The detective?” ‘ V‘

“Yes.” i '

“I was instructed to put this ‘note into your hands,‘
sir, and to await your reply.”

He; extended the envelope as he spoke, and Nick too
it and broke the seal. Then he read: ' ’

“The writer of this letter appeals to Nick Carter in;
the name of humanity.’ The writer is Ivan Dovanief, app.
Russian expatriate, exiled from his own country because
of political opinions which have never yet taken the form’
of offenses more than the mere expressionof opinions,
With that much of explanation,» Iiwill proceed in the’

i first person. -

“I crave your indulgence, sir, in the reading of
Lhavesto say here, and in my personal behalf thereafter,
if I am fortunate enough to appeal to“a responsive 

pulse in your kindrheart.”

The detective stopped reading in the rnidclle of"ti.‘l

letter, and raised his eyes to the maniwho waited bef 

him.

 BLEAUTIL1‘-‘UL’ Nmrnrs-r_.

When the servant of Ivan Dovanief, left hir;n,SthLe_ 
tectix‘/e returned slowly to his study. d "

He could not have told, if any one had asked him,why 
y the odd letter he had received from the Russian should 7

have interested him at all or why he should have deemed
it worthy of notice; still less could he have explained

the unaccountable interest he felt in the man who posed L

as a servant, "who had the outward appearance of a boot,
but who spoke and acted like an “educated Lg'entlemLan.j *
But things Russian had always interested the detective.‘
The readers ofthe iNick:Cartei-‘ histories’ will recall’
fact’ that hehas‘ had many. adventures in that country!
among the nihilistsythe terrorists, and other apolitical
offenders. . Li " a
He did not, however, recall the ‘name of Ivan Dovanief

i as one that was at allfamiliar to him or which suggested;

any recollection of his past experiences in Russia. 
But the “detective had a, friend in .New York at tha

. time who was then, and is now,‘ associated with the
fUnited States Secret Service, but who, ,prior’”to his

services in/this country, had been employed at otherttixnes

' by the F renchiGo}vernment and as ‘a member of the

,.i

As he seated himselfin hisschair in the study, he we

“Because if you have nothing better tovdo, ,IlL would

It was Nick Carter who released Olga Dovanief from
'her'unpleasant condition, and he noticed with some inter-
est that her conduct when she ,was liberated was directly
he antithesis of her mother’s.

 ‘ef had taken no part in the ‘proceedings inleither of

;Now, while Olga Dovanief was collecting her thoughts,
d apparently trying to recover an equanimity which
shehad not lost, Nick turned‘ to him swiftly, and,ut-
V red the single sentence: ' ,
"‘Take; Madam .D0vanief back into the front room,

CHAPTER VI.
A‘ A HOUSE or TRAGEDY. V
The detective had beenlobliged to think quickly while
these scenes were taking place within the two rooms ala

ready described.
And he had been quick to notice that there had been al-

‘most too much system in the preparation of these scenes) V
just encountered to make them seem logical, compared

to the time that had passed since their creation. _
It seemed to him that the dead man on the ﬂoor 
the back‘ parlor was the only real incident of the whole
atfair, and, while for the moment he had no doubt “what;_'-
ever that Dovanief had been killed, the impression was
forcibly upon him that the assassination had been done
with the connivance and approval of Orloff and
two women he had ‘found, bound and gagged, in t
house. = 
The disorder in the front room‘ and in the bad? 
on the second ﬂoor was rather too studied, and much
too complete, to seem natural to the‘ detective. ,
There’ was nothing, however—-there had been nothing
—in the attitude and demeanor of Orloﬁ to suggest

that he was a party to-the crime; that is, nothing’ save"
this general association with it.‘%

The body of alcorpse at that season of the year do
not grow cold rapidly. Rigor mortis will not set in 
times for several hours, and the fact that the body ‘by
the murdered man was still warm when they discovered

could have no scientiﬁc bearing upon the case, bu .

~ could inﬂuence the detective’s mind ‘considerably in,

characterization of the incident. - A a
When he touched the body in’ the ﬁrst place, upon

tering the room where it was found, it seemed to hi

minutes-when they found him.

’ If an assassin had waited outsideffor the depa
of Orloff, and had entered the house-after he ,had
to meet the detective, the murdered man had 13
been dead less than that time. A_ by Y

It wasﬁve minutes past eight when the detective

his friend leftlthe forme§’s,.hoI;se‘tot;iritake the,‘

 Dovanief, and it was not quite half-past eight when they
arrived there. * _
According to Orloff’s statement, it was ﬁve or ten'min-
utes after half-past seven when he departed from this
house of the crime, and in reality only about ﬁfty min-
utes elapsed between the time of Orloff’s departure
from the house and his return to it. '
r Nick Carter scented in this aﬂair a much deeper plot
than appeared upon the surface, and he recalled instantly
the remarks that had been made to him by Malet con-
cerning the two men who‘ were most deeply interested

-in it,¥one of whom was now dead.

Nick would have liked, if it were possible, to have dis-
cussed the matter alone with Malet for a few moments
at that time, but he realized the importance of quickly
getting the story of the young woman while Malet was
listening to what Madam Dovanief had to say about the
circumstances.

The question naturally occurred to the detective’s mind:

, Why did the assassin deem it necessary to bind and

«gag the two women after he had committed the murder
V in the back parlor? Or, reversing the conditions, why,
_ if he had bound and gagged the two women before he
 -I committed the crime, did not the noise of the two strug-
 gles alarm Dovanief, and bring him to their rescue?

If the murderer had entered the house only for the

A purpose of assassinating Dovanief, it was more than
f likely that he knew perfectly well where to ﬁnd him,

Wand had gone directly to the back parlor upon enter-
King. It was within‘ the range of possibility that, upon
~ entering the room, Dovanief’s back might’ have been
turned toward‘ him, and the Russian agitator might
have thought that it was Urloff returning'for a moment
before his ﬁnal departure to getthe detective.

 So it was possible that the assassin might have com-
mitted the murder by striking the moment he entered the
= groom, and thus avoiding any necessity for a struggle
there. V W
_ But, if that »were so, why should he. regard it as neces-
 esarythat he should ascend to the second ﬂoor and at-
ifsi  tack the two women, one after the other, and bind them
  gag them as he had done?

1. aWhy did he attack them at all? Why did he go to
the’ second floor at all? Why, having committed the
crime he came thereto do, did he not make his escape
the instant it was consummated? ~

» Obviously, there was only one answer to these many
questions, and the detective regarded it as an absurd
one.

Q, 7,; It was that there had been at least three men con-

" corned in the attack upon Dovanief, and that the three
assaults had been committed at the same time upon each
 lofvthe victims.

'*'I‘here‘ were. complications in the case which inter-
ested. the detective deeply, and he believed thathe saw

‘behind it a deliberateplot on the part of Orloff andﬁthe _.
two women to rid themselves forever of Ivan Dovanief. ~‘“‘~.A
But at once the question arose: Why should the wife
and daughter of the manconsent to such violent, m"ea's-‘ ‘
ures? Why should they ‘become accessories to it,"and} ” ’
why, if his death were to be the only object to be at-
tained, should they have resorted to this public rnethodﬁ
of killing him, and gone to the lengths they had done to‘/'
secure the presence of the detective, Nick Carter, in the. »
house Within a few moments of the time the deed was 4 l *
consummated? e l ‘
Why should they desire the presence of the detective, '
there at all? i . i M ,
Why had they deemed it necessary, if they were the, z 
chief victims of this assassin, to have themselvesvbound V, 
and gagged, and to pose as quasi victimspof the cute  
rage? _ _ _ " '
All together, the aﬁair was exceedingly puzzling. ' M ,.
Nick felt that Malet’s previous experiences with these " 
people, and his thorough knowledge of their character-
istics, habits, and parts of their lives, would enable him
to reason out the present problems with more accu-;»’.f“,
racy, and yet it was the sort of accuracy which the de-, l
tective deemed it often expedient to avoid, because 
was so apt to be misleading. , , ~ ‘
Nine murders out of every ten are the result of im- 
pulse, but here was one that had been deliberately planned, _l 
and as deliberately consummated, and in such a way than V 
to carry it out as had been done at least three conspire-. N‘
tors would have been required if it were performed by,-,
persons from outside the family. . ' . ~
These conjectures and queries had passed through-' A,
the detectiveis mind one after another since the -mo?-M ' ‘
ment he entered the house; eachadditional scene as lhe;

points. ' . - y '
Now he turned and faced the girl who was alone in“
the -room with him, and who, in the meantime, had ‘arisen.
from the chair, and was standing with her back toward
the mantel——as he looked upon her, and perceived that‘
Malet had not exaggerated at all when he had described A _ ,
her beauty, it came to him that if she was one who could;  J

As the snake retreated, the rabbit, probably crazed by terror,
sprang forward, and, in another instant, had bitten ‘the python

have your life, Caleb Cranshaw, if you do.”
9 Cranshaw went up to him, still retaining the long line
 of the boat in his hands. » r
‘ “The boy shall be put in this boat,” he said, with cruel
distinctness. “He’s tied hand and foot. The tide is going
out. In half an‘ hour he’ll be over the bar-providing
. i that old hulk ﬂoats that long, with nobody to bail it out.”
  Then he motioned to Harlowe to raise Bob’s feet, and
. together they placed him on his back in the bottom of the
V " ‘old boat. Getting into their own they towed the second
T  craft with its helpless burden out into the inlet, and there
let it go. T‘
"So much for spying,” Cranshaw exclaimed exultantly,
t as he turned the head of his own boat up the inlet.

a The old shell, taking water like a sieve, was carried

- swiftly in the opposite direction by the tide, Bob was
i lying in a puddle of water and the moisture; gathered
rapidly. _

- But the villains who had set young Gaylor
‘forgotten the general trend of the current toward *-what
¢-was known as the “Lower Point.” At the Lower Point
"was an old, unused wharf, built so low that at high tide
the water usually was on a level with the flooring, and
. often, as in storms, was a .foot or more above the pier.
 Toward this the old boat drifted, and was soon bump-
. ingher shakynose against the piles. It ,was a lonesome
spot, and even if Bob had been able to cry out, his voice
‘would probably have been unheard.

Finally, the old boat, as though that was just what she
» had been searching for, pushed her way between the piles
, underneath the wharf,.and, swinging about broadside,

‘ ﬂoated up against the lower piles and therestopped. The
Supports of the wharf were so’ close together at this outer
side that there was little opportunity for the craft to ﬁnd
,1 her way out. ’

Meanwhile, Bob was in an agony of apprehension.
Not only ,for his own life was he fearful, but he, now
realized that the three men who had placed him in his
;.present position must have had some strong reason for
their‘ action. They had, committed some ‘crime at the
hotel, which was of such a serious ‘nature that every wit-
jness of their ﬂight must _be put out of the way.

_ Struggling seemed to make no impression whatever on
his_bonds,'and his jaws ached so from the presence of
the gag that the,teai;s were fairly forced from his eyes.
He knew when the tide ceased running out, for the boat
\ popped bumping against the wharf supports, and lay still
for some time. Suddenly he was aroused by feeling a jar

t It was growing light by this time. The rain had long

fieased Bob thought that" it would be a fair day; but the
breakers still boomed upon the bar outside, and the tide
would doubtless rise higher than commonly. _

,This thought suddenly smote across“ his mind, and the’
gcoldfperspiration started out allloverhim. 'The tide_ was

was it would probably force‘ the old ‘boat down, and he
would be drowneii! - . i . ’
