“Headstrong, is he ?” r

“Yes, sir; very much set in his way."

“How did you happen to be on the same steamer
with Terhune ?”

“I was going ‘to Boston to interview  capital-
ists there who are also intending to put money into the
mine. By chance, Terhune was on the same boat.
We met and had a long talk. I upbraided him, and———
by the way, here is a point that may be of importance.
I told Terhune I was going to get you to investi-
gate the mining proposition for me, if I could, and the
mere mention of your name made him furious.”

you overboard?”

“Yes, sir.” -

“The Boston men sent an expert in whom they have

“That sample was not out of the expert’s hands, day

NICK CARTER WEEKLY. 7 1

Passing through a long. darkihall, Terhune made an
exit through a door opening on Canal Street.

The tough, apparently, did not come out of the
building. A

The man who did follow Terhune out onto Canal
Street looked more like a laborer than he did like a
tough. . ’
The Westemer, walking leisurely, made his way to
\the next block and halted in front of a four—story
building.

There was a moving van back to the curb in front,

. and ‘at the very top of the building two men were en-

gaged-“in rigging a block and tackle.
Terhune came to a halt before a door leading into a

hallway‘ 3114- from there, for the first time, he took a
survey of the street behind him.
The laborer, his hands‘ in his pockets and ‘a1 cob pipe

in his mouth, was watching the riggers at work on the

roof. ! g
There was nothirig suspicious about the laborer, and

. 'Terhlme passed into the building and started upstairs.

‘When he reached the head of the ‘first ﬂight the la-
borer was in the door ay. _
ii Something had been shouted by one of the men on
the roof.  r .

tered the room. but he was fairly certain it was Ter-

hune. T . ._

Proceeding noiselessly to the door, he halted and lis-
tened.

Voices, pitched in a low key, reached him.

It was impossible to distinguish the spoken words,
although Patsy strained his ears in the attempt. ’

He was anxious to overhear something which would
make it absolutely sure that he was on the right trail.

Stooping. he tried the old-fashioned trick of look-
ing through the keyholit. but fotuid that a hat had
been hung from the knob inside, effectually covering

' the small aperture.

Raising himself erect. Patsy made a quick survey to
left and right.
Instinctively. he came to the conclusion that the door

‘to the right of the one before which he was standing

was more promising than the one on the left.

He went to the door and tried it, but found it
locked. T A A ‘

-\ skeleton key admitted him with very little trouble,
and he found himself in an empty room. V 

A door led from this room into the one xrhich Ter-
hune had entered, but it was closed and probalilyp fast—
ened. '

Again Patsy tried to look through the keyhole, but
this time_he found the opening stuffed with paper.

‘5It"s dead sure  do thingsiin that; room} they

‘ .don’t want people to get on to,” thought Patsy. “and

that proves, in a way,.ttiat.my marrjs there. Still, I'd
like to  a fair and square look at him."

' Sinking down on his knees, he laid  ear agaiiist A 
tlie-‘crack at the edge of the door. - , 7 . i p
The talkers were still guarded irrtheir tones, and he 3:
'could hear nothing; _ .— ~ V g t e -- L M
He remained on his knees, however; and presently he i 

heard a movement as of some one rising.
Steps crossed the floor.‘

“5I’his’-is’5getting5infernal'ly~ tiresome,” said a “roice- T
* ‘4‘Gillmanr is‘ slow in" keeping his appointment." . V

t

        
 
  

  

T “Something has happened to detain him,"  an— L‘

    

‘ “Let’s go out and get a drink. Probably he’ll be
4 ‘here by the time we get back.”
' “I'm with you, old man.”

Some one else arose and crossed the floor.

Then the door was unlocked, opened, closed and
locked again, and steps could be heard passing down
the hall.

‘Rising quickly, Patsy went to a window overlooking
the street, raised it and looked down. ,

I . He was rewarded by seeing Terhune come out ac-

companied by a short, thick-set man with an iron-gray

I rnusgche. A ‘

i The second man looked like another Westerner.

“Bully!” exclaimed Patsy, withdrawing and closing

l the window. “V\’l1en Gillman gets here I must be in
t other room.” '

He went back to the door communicating with the
other room.

, A few moments’ work with a knife blade suﬂiced to
pick out the paper, and a skeleton key did the rest.
After closing and locking. the door from the other

side, Platsy carefully replaced the paper in the keyhole

and turned for a look at the room he was then in.
It was almost, as bare as the apartment he had just
I left. . -
’ I A huge .roll—top desk was in evidence and three com-

NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

There was absolutely no place in which he could
hide himself, unless-———

He looked at the desk and then measured himself
with his eyes.

The steps were coming along the hall, now, and it
was too late for him to use the skeleton key and get
out of the room. even if he had wanted to.

VVithout pausing another instant, he crawled into
the desk and pulled at the roll-top until he got it
down.

It was a tight squeeze, and when the roll-top de-
scended the lock snapped.

But Patsy did not care for that.

The only thing that worried him was that one of the
two men might notice that the rol1—top was shut and
not half open. '

That was not a very long chance, however, and, any-
way, Patsy had to take it.

The door was unlocked, opened, and the men came
111.

,From the footfalls alone Patsy’s keen car could tell
that there were three men instead oftwo.

“W'e were up here waiting for you, Gillman,” said
a voice. 1 ’

“If I had come any sooner I'd have missed that
high ball,” answered a second voice.

“When you turn the key, i,Terhune,” observed a
third voice, “don’t neglect to hang that slouch of yours
over the knob.” -

The wearer of the slouch hat was the man Patsy
was shadowing, so he had learned the fel1ow’s name.

The key scraped in the lock. -

“There you are, Starlick,” answered Terhune. “The
key ﬁlls up the hole enough, I should think. Besides.
we won’t keep Gillman over two minutes.”

“Long enough to'give me a retainer,” chuckled Gill-
man. '

“How much of a retainer do you want ?”

“Five hundred. After that. and before these capital-
ists turn over their good money, I want forty—ﬁve hun-
dred more.” ‘ '

“That’s big pay for fifteen minutes’ work."

“It’s no pay at all for the risk I run.”

“Well, well, never mind. Here's your ﬁve hundred.’

“Thanks. , And the cigarettes ?”

“Here; two boxes of them.” ,

“Heavens, man! How -many do you  me to

“At Boucicaulfs, Hamilton Street, Brooklyn.”

" “Don’t try any of your Montana tricks with me, you
two. I,won’t stand for it, and I'll queer your game
if it lands me in the pen.”

was necessary for him. somehow, to separate himself “
from the desk. ' '

To do it then was out of the question.

The workmen went to thewvindows and took out the
sash. » I —\i ,

Patsy could hear them, and he could also hear T er.-"
hune and Starlick moving about the room.

Finally the workmen came to the desk, took hold of
/it, and shoved it across the room. . l ‘

“Empty. boss?” queried one of the men.

“Y ,” answered Starlick.

“Mighty heavy for an empty desk.” A . t

‘ “I'll risk it. «If it’s smashed it comes out o’ my pay.’.’

There were other things that couldn't comeout of
the man's pay. if the rigging let go, and Patsy was as;
ncarfiin a ﬂutter as his nerve ever allowed hiiiftohe.

A hawser was put around thedesk both ways. i

 “I'll slide around to the house and put Nick next,"

neither was Chick. .

 ‘‘I’ll have to go to Boucicault’s,” thought Patsy,
J “and I can’t wait any longer for Nick.” _

“ on Nick’s desk: ~

“That remains to be seen.”

“I don’t think there will be a chance for you. The

Jones. _ ‘

“I suppose you won’t object to letting me see the

“Certainly not; only don’t deceive yourself with
false hopes, that’s all.”

Bates, the expert, here interjected a few remarks.

“This is the Royal Ophir ore, gentlemen,” said he.
“I took a fair sample from the main vein of the mine,
sacked and sealed it on the spot, and the sample was.
not out of my hands until deposited in the bank, from
which we just took it. ‘

“I will take an oath that it has not been tampered ‘

with in any way. On the result of this assay I assure
you that you can spend one million, or ten millions,
and be perfectly confident that you are going into the
deal with your eyes open.

to the assayer. “It  understood that we are all to
be present during the assaying.”

“That is my understanding,”- said Cupell.

He opened a door leading into one of the work-
rooms.

A dark-faced young man of twenty or thereabouts,
wearing a white apron and smoking a cigarette, was
busying himself about the room.

On an iron slab Cupell opened the ore sack and
emptied the? pieces of ore out on the slab for general

“I don’t think you ought to touch this rock, gen-

“I don’t think any of us would put ‘salt’ into this

After half and hour of hard‘ labor, Nick pulled his
hands apart and brought them around in front of him.

“Now for a little light,” said he. ‘

Sitting up on the stone ﬂoor, he brought out his
littk pocket—lamp——which was one ‘of the things he
always carried with him-and pressedithe spring that
released the electric ‘ current.

 A shaft of bright light pierced the gloom.

 x Nick ﬂashed the gleam slowly around.

i He and his assistant saw that they were in a vaulted
-chamber, perhaps a/dozen feet square.)

The walls and roof were of stone. .

There were no openings anywhere—-—that is, none
that could be seen.

“How the dickens did they get us in here ?” asked
Chick. .

“I-i’ossibly they lowered us down from the top.
There may be a trap in the roof of the vault. Hello!
VVhat’s this? A knife, by George!”

Insweeping the ray of light across the ﬂoor it had
struck uponia gleaming object that lay less than a
half dozen feet away.

Nick reached for it.
It was a pearl—handletl knife, such as gentlemen

T{V\

On a piece of ;silver set into the pearl there were
two initials.

“Mine, too.” - _* ;

“I wonder if I’ve been touched?” Chick began, turn- ‘
ing his pockets inside out. “Oh, no, I haven’t been
touched,” he remarked, dryly; "I’ve been grabbed. I
haven’t got so much as a toothpick left. Those long- a

shoremen probably got the rake-oft’ for their trouble.” 

“I have nothing left but the pocket-lamp," said Nick. 9

,“In, some way they overlooked that. «The thing for ‘by

us to do is to get out. I have a pressing engagement 3
at Montgomery’s house in Forty—fourth Street, to«
morrow morning at ten. What time do you think it is
now?”

“No idea.”

“It can’t be more than nine or ten."

Picking up a small piece of stone that lay on the
ﬂoor, Nick started along one of the walls. tapping on I
every rock. i

Chick took his cue and began doing likewise. >

Suddenly Nick paused. A

“Smell anything, Chick?”

“I was just going to ask you the same question.”

“VV hat do you think it is?”

V “Gas.” .

‘‘That’s "what I think.”

Nick flashed the light on his assistant’s face and I
saw that it had become exceedingly grave. ,

Chick realized what the game was, and it was
enough to make him sober.  I

“They intend to kill us with that gas,” said he.

“And they’ll do it,” answered Nick, grimly, “if we
can’t ﬁnd the jet and plug it up.”

The incandescent light in the pocket-lamp. of course, 1
would not ignite the escaping gas, and Nick ﬂashed the I

penciled beam to every point of the side walls, the floor 
and the roof. - 7’
Not a sigh of pa gas-pipe could be seen.
But the gas was coming from somewhere, and com—
ing in a quantity that would soon ﬁll the chamber. 2
Breathing was already exceedingly diﬁicult. 
“Go on tapping the walls,” gasped Nick. “If we 
don’t find away to escape. or get next to that gas .3
plug, we’ll be laid out cold.” I 5‘

Goaded by ‘the foul atmosphere, which was rapidly

becoming more and more poisonous, the two detect- 1

felt as ‘though compressed under a ton’: weight.

“Take me on your shoulders,” said Nick .

The light was still burning, and Nick, with an awk-
ward movement, turned the ray upon his companion.

Chick had straightened out along the ﬂoor and was
lying still and motionless. .

“I guess it's all day with us,” thought Nick. “To
think that we are to be done to death like this, and
die like rats in a trap!”

He felt his senses going and fell from his knees.

As he did so, and just at the last moment of con-i
sciousness, he thought he saw one of the blocks in
the floor begin to rise. V

Was it an illusion of his disordered senses?

It could not be! - 9 .

For, as the stone arose, a draught of fresh air came
through the opening it left in the floor.

Nick inhaled a great draught of it and started to

 

his knees once more.

The ray from the pocket—lamp was focussed upon the 
stone. "

said, and they might as well go home and catch forty
winks of sleep before morning.

- In truth, Nick and Chick were both in need of a
quiet time, for they were still weak from the rough
treatment they hadreceived and dizzyfrom the effects
of the gas. ,‘ ’

A few hours’ rest put them in shape, and next morn-
ing at nine, Nick started Chick and Patsy off for forty-
fourth Street, suitably disguised.

Chick was to post himself at the front of the Mont~
gomery house, and Patsy at the rear.

When they had been gone‘ a half hour, Nick left
the house in his make-up of “Jones of Albany." _

He hired a cab and was driven to the Montgomery
house.

A man in a white suit was working in the street in
front of the house, and this man was Chick.

Nick told the cabby not to wait, paid him and as-
cended the steps and pushed the electric bell.

Aﬂhousemaid came to the door.

“I would like to see Mr. Montgomery,” said Nick.

“He’s not at home, sir.”

“Then I would like to speak with Miss Louise [ans-
ing.”

“She is not well this morning.”

“I think she will see me. I wish to talk with her
about her brother.”

A voice from the second floor came down the.stair-
way behind the maid. .

“Have the gentleman come in, Mary. Show him
up to ’uncle’s study—I will see him there.” .

Nick was admitted and uyshpered up the broad stairs

into a large room, lined with books and comfortably

furnished. -

An open desk, strewed with papers,,was at one end
of ,t.he'.r9om.-_  p '  , ,

A young lady of eighteen or nineteen, very pretty
but very much depressed, as Nick could see, met him

“Do you know whether John is alive? Oh, tell me

Her eyes opened very wide, but she did notask Nick
why he desirqd all this.

It was evident that she thought it was all in the
line of his duty and that questioning would be out of
place.

‘fl will do as you say, Mr. Car——Mr. Jones.”

Nick was about to speak on, but his eye caught a.
flash of something among the papers on the desk.

He picked up the object and found that it was a
small, nickel-plated instrument used in manufacturing
cigarettes.

“To whom does this belong?” he inquired.

“To Uncle Horace. Do you know what it ,is, Mr.
Jones?”

Nick ignored the question.

“How long has your uncle had it P” e

“I do not know. I only remember seeing it here i
during the last two o1~three days.”

“You would have seen it if it had been here before ?"‘. '

“I think so.”

“What a curious question, Mr. Jones,” smiled
girl. “No, he does not."

NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

“DEAR BINGHAM2 Called away and cannot meet
you and Cooper at ten this morning. Deal is off for’
to-day. Return by ﬁrst train to Boston and wait there
until Terhune and I come.”

Nick put this in the envelope, sealed it with mucilage
found on the desk, and laid the letter on the book on
the library table, just as it was before.

In looking for the mucilage he had to disturb the
papers a little, and he found something else which
he considered of the utmost importance.

This something else was a cigarette box containing
five cigarettes which ﬁtted the cigarette machine and
also bore a perfect resemblance to the cigarette Nick
had smoked, the day before, in the assay oﬂﬁce.

Nick sank back in the chair, his face extremely
thoughtful.

“VVell, well,” he muttered.

Just then Miss Lansing came hurriedly in.

“The two gentlemen whom uncle expected are down-
stairs at the door,” she ‘said, walking to the table and
picking up the letter. “I will return presently, Mr.
Jones.”

“I am in no hurry, Miss Lansing.” ‘

VVhen again left alone, Nick picked a cigarette from
the box and-put it in his pocket.

He was ready to leave when Miss Lansing returned.

“Must you go?” asked the girl.

“Yes, but I would like to leave some one here, if I

you have noobjections.”
I “\/Vho, Mr. Jones?” J

“One of mysassistants. If possible, I would be glad
if his presence here could remain a secret between us
—-even if your uncle should come.” -

“It could be arranged, Mr. Jones.”

“Then I will summon my assistant. VVill you con-
duct me to a rear window on this ﬂoor?”

'The girl was puzzled, but led Nick to a window in
the rear, overlooking the backyard between Forty-
fourth and Forty-ﬁfth Streets. _ ' .

In one of the yards, in plain view of the rear of the
Montgornery house, a roughly dressed young man

' was working at a clothes-pole.

' Nick wavedhis hand.

 Theman nodded ‘and started to slide down.

‘_‘Now‘," said Nick, “if I can go down and admit

“Cooper,” he cried, “what does this mean?”

He walked upthe stairs, Chick close behind him.

When they had passed from sight, Nick turned to
Louise Lansing, who was standing in the parlor door-

“ls—-is it really you, Mr. Carter?” she queried.

“Yes.”

“I can hardly believe my eyes.”

“Is everythingall right?”

“It is.” i

“How long has your uncle been here?”

“Not more than an hour.”

“Now, listen, Miss Lansing. I will give the signal
by dropping a book.” '

“I understand.” ‘ _ _

Nick ran hurriedly upstairs, and, as he turned from
the landing, Patsy stepped out of a room and caught
his sleeve.

f‘Anything happened here since I left you, Patsy?”
whispered Nick. ‘ *

“Not a thing of any consequence.”

“You understand what's to be done?”

to beﬁeve that you are Arthur Bennett. Am I right?” .
The chief looked admiringly at Jack while the stranger
answered: "Yes, you are right. I am Mr. Bennett’s
nephew. Will you look at the scene of the tragedy?
We have left everything untouched, so that you might
get all the claws." ‘ V

Accordingly all four ascended to the libfary where the
dead body of Mr. Bennett had been discovered. The li-
brary table, where the millionaire had been accustomed
to sit. was piled full of papers. In the chair, with his
body leaning over on the table, was the dead money king.
In the back of his head, almost midway betweenhoth
ears,.was an uglv wound, where the bullet had done its i
work. for he had been shot. There" was little blood,  ,
showing that death had been instantaneous. No weapon  
of any kind .was to be seen. About ten feet behind the
chair was a door, opening into his nephew's room. ‘ '
“Now, boys, let’s get to work,” said the chief. “In the a

first place I’d like to ask some questions. Who discovv .

“VVould you kindly"show us your room ?” said the chief,
turning to Arthur.

The young man reluctantly consented, and, opening the
door, all four crowded into the room.

“This, I suppose,” said Jack, facing a large dresser,
“is where you usually stand when retiring.” Suddenly
Jack opened the top drawer of the dresser. What ob-
ject was it that met their view? A ﬁve-chamber revolver,
.38—caliber, and one chamber was discharged!

“That explains why there was no weapon to be seen,”

“The question was, who was the murderer? l ques-
tioned Arthur before I came up here, and the servants
also, but they claimed that all windows and doors were
securelyﬂoiked. Shortly after my interview with the
servants, th coroner anda physician arrived. After ex-
amining the dead man they both expressed their opinion
that he had-been dead at least ten hours. I looked over
the library again, searching for clews. I also examined
the revolver. And, chief,.if you will again visit the scene
of the tragedy with me I will explain to you how Mr. Ben-
nett died.’ _

The chief consented, and, half an hour later, they again
entered the fatal room. Proceeding to a spot directly
behind the chair, Jack showed the chief a little dent in the
wanted ﬂoor, such as would be produced by the falling
of a metallic object on it. Jack then showed him the re-‘
volver, on the pearl handle of which was a newly made
crack. '

“You see,” said the young detective to his superior,

One "dark night, near the hour of twelve, Jud Nichols

was visited by a robber, whose sole desire was to secure
the hidden wealth. The thief gained an easy entrance
= to the structure. through the aid of a skeleton key.

,. After ﬁrmly assuring himself that the old niggard was
not awake, he silently searched ‘for the secreted money.
, ‘He did not go about his work like one who is new at the
, trade, but explored the rooms like an expert. _ _

-. After a thorough and extended search the midnight
prowler was rewarded for his work, for, lying on the
..very bottom of the old man's wood—box, was the cov-
eted sack of money. The thief quickly placed the bag
of coin in another sack, which he had, and with noise-
less footsteps started for the door. The robber had ar-
" rived at the threshold, when a loud report echoed through
. the“roan'r,4 and the robber fell headlong down the steps
with a bullet wound in the ﬂeshy part of his leg. Jud

“Hush!” sounded again from below. The ﬁery eyes
were again turned upward.

“Boys,” said a voice, “I am going to take a shot up
there‘ just for luck.”

It was the voice of Jesse James, the bandit king of
America. ~ _
Not forgone instant did Carl Green’s presence of mind
desert him.

“Katy did,” he chirrupped.

“Katy didn’t,’’ he also chirrupped, in flat contradiction.

Jesse James laughed ashamedly.

“It’s only a couple of Katy-dids a-scrappin’,” be con-
fessed, sheepishly,

Sliding hastily down a water-spout, Carl Green dis-
appeared in the night.

-"Ha, ha!” cried Jesse James, the bandit. Anon he
changed the respective positions of the aspirants. “.—\h,
ah !” he then said.

Carl Green, turning quickly around, gazed with an eagle
eye up.the barrels of two seven—shooters. ‘ A

Jesse James scowled ﬁercely. Carl
stanch. The night was very dark.

“They are dun‘!-dum bullets," explained Jesse. kindly.

“It makes no diﬁerence,” coldly remarked Carl Green.

. “VVhy not ?” snarled Jesse. “Why not? I'd like to

know.” '
"Because your guns will flash in the pan.” calmly re-
plied the famous detective, with a majestic attitude of de-
rision.
"Devill” hissed the bandit, lowering his murderous
weapons. \

, With a haughty stride Carl Green turned on his heel.

2 “I.'ll tryvit, anyhow," muttered Jesse James to himself.
hoarsely, He aimed both revolvers at the ﬁgure of the
retiring detective.

"Dum-dum,” spoke the guns. “Dam-dam.” spoke Carl
Green, acutely identifying himself .as the injured party.

later. and the surgeon promptly diagnosed the case as al-

' It was not until they proceeded to lift Carl Green’s re-
cumbent form into the waiting wagon that the doctor dis-
covered, from the tremendous weight of the body, that the
man was stuffed with lead at every pore.

"After a decent interval the ambulance driver turned
into the hospital courtyard. The doctors gathered around
and examined the wounded man. '

“Ha. ha!” they cried in glee to the. ambulance surgeon.

“He’s a dead one. The drinks are on you. Vi/alking
into the hospital is very thirsty work.” ,

The surgeon, with a gasp of disgust, swallowed his cig-
arette. “Foiled again 1" he exclaimed, bitterly, “and by

his head.
