' the aid of the old man, who was struggling inef-

main street fronted on the’ Moccasin River-an
iinportant stream in that art of the State. But
for lack of railroad faci ities Rushville would
have been ‘a hustling town. ,

l " The nearest railroad station was at Carlin, six
miles away by road. This was the town where
Jabez Green did his banking business. The Rush-
ville Bank was every bit as [solid an institution as
the. Carlin National. and every business man in
the village, Mr. Green excepted. ‘deposited his
funds in it. Why the factory owner held aloof,
and submitted to the weekly inconvenience, win-
ter and. summer alike, of a. twelve mile round
trip over the county road, rather than patronize‘
his home bank. was a mystery to his acquaint-
ances. Jabez Green drove straight to the oﬂice
of the head constable of the village. This was in
one corner of the lock-‘up,’ and that building stood
close to his cottage. Constable Allen was seated
in his oﬂice smoking and talking politics with a
villager when Mr. Green intruded upon him and
toldhim he had ‘a prisoner to hand over. _

-. “A prisoner, Mr. Green!” exclaimed the oili-
C61‘, in surprise. _ - 7

.“Yes: he’s one of two rascals‘ who held me up

« along the trunpike and would have robbed me of

a considerable sum only for a boy who came along

_ at the time and turned the tables on them. Come
 _ ' out and take charge of him.” ,

” The ‘constable, who was a big, muscular man,

_ as beﬁtted his calling, accompanied the factory

owner outside, and looked at the prisoner, _who

h'ad,come to his senses, and appeared to be i a

.2 very ugly mood over his capture.

" hold of him and yanked him out of the Wagon.

“So, my ﬁne fellow,’ you are a highway robber, '~

are you?” he said, sternly. “You will ﬁnd_we
. know how to deal with chaps of your calling.
You've a jackknife, Isuppose, Mr. Green? Just»
 cut his legs loose so he can walk.” , l 4
,The factory owner did so. . _
_“Now, come with me,,Mr. Robber and I’ll give
you a nice little room all to your’, If_, where you
can ponder over the future that is in store for
mu‘!} ’ .
He led him into the office first, followed by Mr.
‘Green, and shut and locked the door.
;   “What’s "your name, my ﬁne fellow?” he asked

i  3,“I\'lone of your business,” snarled the man.
’ "‘Then you go down as John Doe. Charge-—at-

tempted highway robbery,” said the constable i

' snaking the entries in his book. “Description-
7 tall, loosely put together, smooth face, cut over
 left eye, short brown hair, etc.v Now we’ll see
 what you have in your pockets.” .
 H The constable searched the prisoner, ﬁnding a
silver quarter, a dirk lmife,_a revolver. and Sun-
 other articles, all of which were duly entered
 [in the book. Then he opened an inner door which
. ‘led into the corridor of the_ lock-up. There were
ﬁxtwo airy cells on either side of it, and a ﬁfth,
{about double the size of the others, at the» far
- end. The cells were provided with iron cotsand
,Som'e.bedding, an iron wash-stand and a chair
clamped to the ﬂoor. Lanky Luﬁ’ was locked into
one-.of them. The constable then -regained the
iactory ‘owner in hisoflice’. ' “ ‘

Green, with the boy, to press the charge,” said’
Mr. Allen. a A =‘
He unlocked the front door so the factory own-

_ er could pass out. Jabez Green drove straight to

the ~factorv which stood close to the bank of the
Moccasin “River. the waters of which furnished the
power, by means of a big wheel provided with
paddles, to drive the machinery of the establish-
ment. Entering the yard he reined beside a
door to which a “No Admittance” sign was af-'
ﬁxed. . .Dismountin2' he motioned the boy to fol-
low him. They walked around to the front of the
building and entered by a door, above which was
a sign reading: “Jabez Green. Rug Manufactur-
er,” while on thevdoor itself was a tin sign mark-

’ ed “Office.”

. The oiﬁce was furnished with a roll top desk and
chair in one corner by a window overlookingthe
street; a tall desk, before which a country-look-
ing youth of sixteen years was perched on a tall
stool engaged with an accountbook and papers,
evidently the bookkeeper of the mill; a safe, which
«stood in another corner, a coyping-press and
stand, and other ‘things that go to make up the 
equipment of a small counting-room. The fore- 
going was separated from a small space for call-
ers to stand by a wooden railingand a swinging
gate. Mr. Green entered the enclosure and mo-
tioned Harry to follow. .- _

“I will make you acquainted with my. nephew,
Sam. this is Harry Harmon.
He’s going to stay with us a day or two, perhaps
longer if he decides to go to work here,” said the

_ mill owner.

, The two boys shook hands, said they were glad
to meet, and eyed each other curiously, as boys
will on a ﬁrst acquaintance.

“Take him around and show him the mill,” said
the old man, turning awav and going to his desk. -
“And tell John to unload the wagon,” he added. ~

“Come along,” said .Sam, passing throijgh ‘a.
door into an entry, where there was a ﬂight of
stairs leading to the ﬂoor above. ~ .

Harry now heard the subdued hum of machin-
cry in motion above. Before mounting the stairs
Sam opened another door off the entry, and Har-
ry saw a large room ﬁlled with tagged bundies
apparently ready for shipment. ; '

“This is our shipping department,” explained
Sam. “Those bundles contain rugs ready to go
back to the people who furnished the material to
make ’em up. You see our business is the manu-7
factureof new rugs out,.of old, and in many in-
stancesuseless, pieces “of carpet. Carpets are
mostly out of style these days. Everybody, as a
rule, uses rugs. They’re handier to clean, and
easily moved about. We do a large business, and

.it’s growing. My uncle has, been in it twen -
. ﬁve years.

_ We advertise extensively in certain
papers ‘and magazines that circulate largely in
the rural districts all, over the country. We get
orders from every State in the,Union.
he said to the man in the room who was marking

a casefwith shipping directions, “the wagon is ‘

_ in the yard with a load of stuff Mr. Green brought
, from Carlin.” ‘ 

“All right; I’ll attend to it,” replied John, with

la". lance at Harry Harmon.
i §Come with me,

  ,.‘.He led the may to a room beyond which was
‘ , ﬁlledwith ‘b‘-‘ndles of old ‘carpet just as they had
, ’ been received from the railroad station. There
was a machine in the room for cutting the carpet
 « upin rliﬂ-‘erent sizes, and. an apparatus for cleans-

» ' ing it both by water, and live steam. ’
“The: f1-a'rmen.ts of. carpet go into the cleansing
machine, locking: faded and ‘dirty.  come out

‘ i where it is pulled to pieces, after which ‘it is hand~

 Harry. ‘ . _ _

“About ten‘ years. There's a house on Goat

John Dean, who squatted on the place.”
“John I)ean!” exclaimed Hal. “I had an uncle

v named John Dean, who was said to be pretty well

thathe promised to leave all his money to her

“As your mother is dead you’d be entitled to
whatever he left. If I were you I’d write to the
Chicago authorities and make inquiries « about
your uncle. It wiil only cost you a itwo-cent ‘
stamp; and postage for a reply.”'

"I might do that,” replied Hal, reﬂectively.

“I’d do it in a minute if I were in your place.

‘ It would be a ﬁne thing for you if he left, a good M

round sum of money and you got it."

“Well,.I su pose that can't be helped. There

Among the things on one-of the shelves was a
well-worn pack of cards. ‘

“Playing solitaire was a favorite amusement» . ,
my uncle," said Hal. “He'd devote hours to .

with
it; ’ That looksllike the same ,old pack of cards

Hal picked the cards up and looked at them in
a reminiscent kind of way. As he put them back

he displaced a small, round Chinese ornament. It ‘

fell to the: ﬂoor and rolled under the sofa bed. ,

“Let it stay there. ~ It doesn't amount, to any-.

“No; it won't take a minute to recover it .by

“I’1l wait for you outside," and as Hal pulled
out the lounge -Sam climbed outof the window.

There wasn't much light in the room, about all
that entered coming through the window the

boys had opened. It was quite dark where the V I

lounge stood, and after Hal pulled it out he

couldn’t see behind it. He got down on his hands-'

and knees and began to feel for the runaway or-

. nament. s

“I guess I'll have to strike a match," he mut-
tered. ‘

He pulled a match out of his vest pocket where V ‘

he always carried a number and reached out his
hand to strike it on the wooden floor. His ﬁngers

came into contact with a metal ring. It was at-, j
tached .to the floor and resisted .Hal’s attempt to

pick it up. 7 .» _
“Feels like ‘an iron ring,” thought Hal.‘ ‘,‘I

a wonder what it is doing here?"

_ He struck the match ‘on the boards. _When the
light ﬂared up he exclaimed,‘ with some surprise:

“Why, it’s a trap-door! There is a cellar-under - " ‘

this house."

asked, looking at the brass—bound money chest.

slow degrees and the expenditure of much musc-

CHAPTER XIII.—-Another Hold-up That Failed."

Monday morning came’ around in due course,
and -I-lalprepared to carry his box of money to
the Carlin_.Nation’al Bank. ’ Mr. Green decided‘ to
accompany him, not only as an added protection

ae\_

for the chest, but to see the county authoritiezs '

about the lease of the island for alleged busiiiess
purposes. Although Hal did not expect to be held

up along the road, still he deemed it wise to ca rry , I

his revolver with him. He said nothing to the
factory owner about having it on his person, ‘nor
did Mr. Green tell him that he, too, carried a re-
volver. . Sam helped carry the box downstairs and
out to the wagon,‘and then went to the oiﬁce as
Hill and his uncle drove off. ‘
Everything went well with them till they drew‘
near a crossroad, about two miles from Carlin.

CHAPTER XV.-Conclusion.

Of course everybody saw that He] had become
the managing head of the ‘factory after Mr.
Green’s death and wondered at it. Naturally they
became inquisitive over the matter and tried to

e ﬁnd out how this thing had come about. Sam
was aked and so were_Mrs. Parker and Hattie,
but they had nothing to say on the subject. /From
a business point of view the village was elated
over the extension of the rug business, for it was
sure to add to theimportance of Rushville. The
Rushville News spoke about it, and advised that

a. committee be formed to. call on‘ the president of»

the railroad company, and try and get that com-

pany to build a branch line from Carlin to the vil-

lage. The editor pointed out that such a line was

. bound to give the ‘village. a big boost, and bring
other manufacturing interests to the place.

,1 The committee was formed and called at-the

company’s offices in .Chicago, onlg to learn that

rought to that

oﬂicial’s attention by Hal Harmon when he was

in that city, and that the matter would shortly

. he submitted to the directors, a representative of

the company being now engaged in investigating
the points advancw by Hal. . ~
Evidently Hal had the interests of the‘ village

as well as his own in view, and was not letting

the grass grow under his feet in his eﬂ"orts to
help both.’ Hal was a mighty busy boy nowadays.

. He kept his eye on everything connected with the
working of the factory. His great object was to
save time. Every minute counted with him, par-
ticularl in the execution of the big» contract he
had on and. The work was to bedlelivered in
Chicago in instalments, but the last of it had to
he landed at the mail-order house on a certain
day, or the rug company would forfeit a certain
sum for every day ofrdelay.

Heihad taken the contract on such a narrow

‘ . margin, that a week’s delay would wipe out the.

V proﬁt of the work. He would have taken the con-

 tract on no ,_,proﬁ§, at all in order to get it, for if

. the work was produced in time and according to
" speciﬁc’ati8ns, it would prove an opening wedge in
the direction he was aiming at. He was now
bucking against big interests, but he was satisﬁed

H" A that he could hold his own against competition. .11?

the Opposition tried to do him up -by bidding
below cost he’ would let them, and fall back on the
line of trade worked up by Mr. Green until they

got tired of that kind of business, when he would ~

‘ Jump right in and bid against them again.

The new up—to-date machinery made things
hum in the factory. It turned the rugs out in
ﬁne shape like clocl<worl~:.' The_machines were
worthvevery cent they cost, and it was a pretty
stiffsum. At the end of two weeks Hal was able

' ~to get a line on his output, and he told Sam that

it ‘came up to his anticipations. .

‘ is Sam couldn’t handle all the .clerical.labor H
. that fell on his shoulders, Hal secured a capable
. assistant to help. him out. . «-

We may as well say that one of the first things

:Hal”’did- before he got the contract -was to buy a

new modern safe for the oﬁice, to'talte the place

i ' . of the antiquated one wl1icl1j7Mr.'Gre'en'.ha_d, used ’‘

wrapped up in business that he couldn’t give some .
attention to Hattie after his day’s work was done.

He and the girl got on famously together, and it . H

Soon after the last instalmentof the contract .L .

was delivered in Chicago‘, the firm received a com-

promising futureorders. -From that time on the

From the_water’s edge to the bluffs extended
a strip of beach a hundred yards wide, and at one
point a pass led through the bluﬁs to the country
beyond, and as soon as it was possible Captain
Essex meant to explore this. ‘ ‘

Since getting into his haven of safety, however,
the weather had been most unfavorable and the
expedition had been deterred. . "

There had been violent snpw—storms which had .
seemed to blot out all things, the wind outside ,
had blown in gales and the darkness had been
intense, so that, all things considered, it was‘use-
less to think of leaving the shi .

The searchlight showed them the ice in front ,
and the bluffs behind, but this was all the light "
they had for days. . . '
Phil and Sadie were happy in each other's com-

-pany, and the time did,.not.hang heavy on their

hands, /but it would have been otherwise withthe
crew if Captain Essex had not continually pro-
vided (for their amusement and entertainment. 

He gave the men books to read, he sent them
out on the ice every day for exercise, he got up .
minstrel entertainment to amuse them, he gave
them amusing talks nearly every evening, and-‘.
tried in every way to make the , time pass
pleasantly. , ‘ "

The men were generally satisﬁed, ‘but’ there,
were some who were not, and Wills had gradually

added to this number, so that he had nearly half » ii

the ship’s company ready to serve him, and was

. trying. every day to increase the number. - /
At last the weather vgrew better,‘ although its
was still intensely cold, but as the moon was 
full: and there were no indications of storms, the *

captain determined to explore the interior.

professor and Dick Foster, leavmg on the Pioneer

i . Laterlin the day he hinted‘ that Captain Essex
did notimeanp to return, and that they might as
well ive him up. , _ " A '

‘SW at nonsense’ are you talking, Mr. Wills?”
said Sadie, with considerable spirit. “Where

would the captain go iflhe‘ did not come here? .

He has—no ship, and it would be absurd for him
to leave us. "If he had taken boats it would be
different. Then you could saythat he might be
going toileaveus, though even then /it would be
a foolish move, as the ship is better than boats.”

., Wills glared at Sadie and answered in a surly’

tone’: ‘ v

“You_ don't know anything at all about it.
What I meant was that he could not get back,
and there was no use in our waiting for him.
Just as soon as it breaks up here we’ll take the
ship and go in search of the Pole ourselves.”
“ “Captain Harry Essex will come back,’ never

. fear,”'said Phil, “and if anybody ﬁnds the~Pole,

, hewill do it.”

“C_ap“tain Harry, Essexeis not the only’ man in '

the -world,” sneered ,Wi1ls. “If I had a ship of
my own, I’ll guarantee that-I’d ﬁnd it, without
allltljiis useless delay.” '

returns,'I should think,” retorted Sadie, “before»

, “lslaybe. you think’ I would not?” muttered
Wil ' ' ' ‘ ’ l

V “You,don’t'l(now» what I think,” said Sadie, and

1 no more was said.

The next morning Willsiwas more open in his
remarks concerning the absent captain, and de-
clared that he had foolishly sacriﬁced the lives

. ‘of ‘allyhis, party and that hewould never return. "
~ ” Some._of the men expressed the same opinion,

and were bitter toward the captain, when Phil,

" cut themshort by saying:

“You’re a lot of mutinous ingrates, and you’ve
no right to talk like that. Captain Essex will

REINDEER HERDS MAKE FORTUNES FOR
' ' *  ESKIMOS . s 
A reindeer roundup, the first of its ‘kind,  
soon take -place. in Akiak, Alaska.‘ Since the in-
troduction of ‘reindeer into ‘Alaska, some fort‘;
years ago,‘ the animals have multiplied greatly.
and itjis,:estimated that they now number 500_,—
000. ‘Some of the herds are so large that their
owners cannot keep count. It is said that if an-
other market is not found soon the Alaskan
ranges will be ‘badly overstocked. _ ‘
Forty ars ago when Dr. Sheldon Jackson,
represent’ the United States, Bureau of Edn-
cation, visited Alaska tr gather information for

- the establishment of schools there, he observed

that many Eskimos were barely existing on scanty‘ - A
supplies of whale,_seal -and walrus meat. .

Upon his return to Washington, Dr. Jackson
suggested that appropriations be made for the .
importation of reindeer into Alaska. Three years , ‘
later‘Congress, realizing the importance of such a
move and following the lead of private eiforts
that had already begun to bear fruit, appropriat-
ed $6,000. Additional appropriations varying
from $5,000 to $25,000 have since nvmade.

Reindeer provide work for many Ekimos and
bring wealth to some. The United States uses .
each year an increasing amount of reindeer meat.‘ ’
Between 1918 and 1925 more than 1,500,000 *'
pounds were shipped from Alaska, principally to '
the United States. V

TROUT on LIVER MUST COME OFF
‘ _ THE MENUS ‘
John W. Titcomb, Superintendent of the Con;
nect1cut.State~Department of Fisheries and Game,
speaking recently at the fourteenth national game 3* 1

‘ conference under the auspices of the American‘

Game Protective Association, at, the Hotel Penn"-" 7
sylvania, declared that Americans must soon i
choose between liver and salmon and trout as 0
articles of diet. - ; " ‘ ; A '
“If the American people continue to eat liver
there will soon be a dearth of salmon and trout,”
said Mr. Titcomb, _“b:-zcause itwill be too expen- N

, sive to use liver as’ food in the ﬁsh hatcheries."

He did not say whether he thought it more irn- 

A portant to feed liver to fish or to people.

Paul F. Redin’gton, Chief of the United States
Bureau of Biological Survey, said the ordinary
rabbit was the carrier’ of a frequently fatal dis- 1 ’
ease called ‘5tularemia." He said that cases in ,~ \

The  Letters I

I was‘ sent over to Brooklyn onemorning about
three years ago to the residence of Mrs. Floyd, a
wealthy widow, who lived in grand style in an ele-
gant mansion on the Heights. . -.

Mrs. Floyd had been murdered the night before

 

i in the most brutal manner.

She had been dragged from her bed and stabbed
in a dozen places.

She was found lying upon the ﬂoor‘ several
feet from her bed, in the morning, by her niece, a

" young lady whom she had adopted as her daugh-

ter, and who had lived with her for several

‘ years. i

,. I was required. to ﬁnd the murderer, if possible.
, On my arrival at the mansion I was ushered

I into the room ‘where lay the body of the murdered

woman. - . « .
Everything was exactly as the young lady had

, found it, except that the body of Mrs.‘ F_loyd had

been laid upon the bed.. .
Evidently the poor woman had struggled hard

for her life. ; 3 »
Several articles of furniture were upturned,‘ and

the carpet was stained. '

“Have you any idea at What hour the murder‘

took place?” I inquired of Miss Ward, the niece,
who conductedpme to the room. , .
“No, sir,” was her ‘tearful reply. “No one'ix1

the house heard anything during the night. All,
. with ‘the exception of myself, slgep on the top

floor of the house. I sleep in the room directly

above this; but I heard no noise whatever."
I 4 I began a search of the apartment, and was soon

rewarded by ﬁnding three letters, whicli',liad- ap-

» parently fallen from the murderer-’s-pocket. ‘ _
2 ~'Ijhey were lying under one of the overturned’ \

chairs- , . . . __, I
' read the directions upon the envelopes. . , g
“It” was “Charles R. Stoddart, No.—-- Fulton

rooklyn.” ‘

».I,put-' he letters in my pocket.‘-

‘, ' Then’ _I’summoned Miss Ward, who had left the
‘ room. .

When she appeared I,,as'ked heri

_ Her beautiful face paled instantly: ’

“_I do, sir,” she said, “but for heaven’s, sake

"why do you ask that at this dreadful time’? What

Wlias he‘to do with this terrible affair?” - ,
‘ “Did your aunt approve of the match?” I asked.

‘For a moment she hesit ted; then she replied:
“He is my aﬁ'ian‘ced husb nd.” , , »__
3 On hearing this .a suspicion of how affairs stood

in i at once entered my mind.

 “Did your aunt approve of the match?” I asked;
“No, sir, she did not,” was the reply. “But what
has he to do with the murder?” .
,“That will presently appear, Miss Ward,” I said.
“And now all'ow,‘me»to ask, why did your aunt ob-

In reply I showed her the three letters, saying; ’

Miss .Ward,’’ .1 said, -“If' he is really; innocent,
rest assured he shall not suffer for the crime.’’’ 
But in my own mind I was firmly convinced that :
Charles Stoddard was the murderer. . 3  *~:
I went to the window. U ’l . g  '
The room ,.was at the back of the house on the ; wt
second story, and a grape arbor which«'exten'dedto»,—

OLD INDIAN MINT

Among the exhibits in the Indian exposition at
the Newark Museum are specimens of Wampum

money made; in a New Jersey factory that for‘
four generations made Indiamcurrency for use on "

the plains. The Wampum mint of the Campbells

’ at‘Pascac'k has long since fallen into ruin but for '

more than ahundred years it turned out the bead
money of the Indian. Not until 1887 did it close
its doors._ I _ _ ,’ M ‘ —

‘John Jacob Astor and other great‘ fur traders
of the early days were callers ‘at the\Campbell
mint, where they purchased the ~wampum with

whicllto buy the skins, of beaver,‘béar and buffalo.

from the.Indians of the north, and west. , Until
the middle of the last century stores in the vicin-

ity of Pascack accepted the Wampum as currency’

for small accounts, knowing that the ﬁrm would
always buy it back. It was made by the wives

and ‘daughters of farmers, under‘ the Campbell’s , " ‘

direction.

The decline. of Wampum as Indian currency
commenced in 1830 and practically came to an end
when theAG-overnment g-avethe Black Hills reser-
vation to the Indians. Virtually all the Camp!

bell wampum went to the prairies and mountains .  .

of the ‘Far West: as the red men of nearer re-
gions had become ‘ar.-mvstomed to. real money.’

WOMEN HEAVY WINNERS ONTRACK
 . - , THIS YEAR ~ .
To the women went most of the laurels of the
past thoroughbred racing season. The active in-
terest taken‘ by women in horse racing is one of
the sport’s, notablev recent deevlopments, although

it receives very little attention. _
Mrs. .Payne,Whitney’s stable '.»was the heaviest
money winner. on the New York -tracks. Her

«horses were ~ﬁrst in thirty-one races,,second in‘
forty—two and third in forty-nme, accounting for M

a total of $172,469.‘ _

- Mrs. John D. Hertz of Chicago ﬁnished the sea-
son with the distinction of owning the greatest in-
dividual‘ winner, Anita Peabody, which realized
$111,905 for her owner.
in a sportswoman’s colors, not on! was the first
owned by a woman to be the leading ﬁlly ofpthe
season but is the second ever to establish herself
at the* top of the money-winning_list,--earning
more than her predecessor—Samuel I-Iildreth’s
Beside owning the
ton money winner, ‘Mrs. *Hertz’s stable ﬁnished
fourth in earnings. _

Previouslv the outstandin achievement of a
‘urf woman was when Mrs. . P. Coats won the
Kentuckv Derby with Black Gold. Anita Pea-
body’s best single performance was her triumph
‘n the historic Futurity, in which she brought
$91,000 to her owner. Mrs. Whitr'i'ey’s biggest in-
dividual winner was the niagniﬁcent steeplechas-
or, Jolly Roger. That, great jumper of Mrs.
Whitney’s Green tree Stable won six races and ac7
counted for $63,075. "

FOOD CHEAPER IN EUROPE

A recent survey of food. prices in Europe has ’
disclosed that they are slightly lower than prices
for the same food commodities in the United
States, according to an announcement of the -re-
sults of the survey recently by the National‘ In-
dustrial Conference Board.. ' ' .

A Philadelphia housewife who pays $1 for a
market basket of food, if making her purchases
in corresponding circumstances in Paris and liv-
ing as a Parisian in her circumstances would live,
would have to pay only 70 cents to_ﬁll her market
basket. ‘She would pay 90 cents in Rome,"ap,- ~
proximatelv Jovcents in Vienna, 75 cents in Stock- ,
helm and Berlin. 73 cents in London, 70 cents in
Brussels and 60 cents in Amsterdam- '

“These ﬁgures, however‘, are based primarily
upon Europemi standards of living,” says the
Conference Board’s report, “and it is likelvthat
the American living abroad, ordering exactly the’
same dinner in a Paris restaurant that he would
eat at home, might even pay considerably more Vi

' than at home.” _
