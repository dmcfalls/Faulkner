“Ninety-nine 1”

hich he had ornamented in common with nine
Jother-boys of varying ages and sizes, and ap-
roaching the counter behind which stood a dap-

':“'I‘,e_n little messengers sitting in a line; take
nefvaway and there are nine,” softly chirruped
 ennie Bennett, otherwise ‘Messenger 23, who

.He was Messenger 99’s chum. _ The operator

looked at the name and address that was ﬁlled in

. “Where are you bound, Fred?” asked Bennie
this friend passed him. .

No; South street,” replied Hooper.

‘_A nice foggy night for a tramp along the

_Bennie’s ﬁnal sentence did not reach Fred's
ears,’ as he twasalready on the other side of the
‘door.’ It was a foggy night for fair. The mist
had been sifting in from the ocean all afternoon,
izjcompanied by a slight drizzle that had had a
_ery., depressing effect on the lower part of the

the Bronx. V J .
Messenger 99 was employed in a lower Broad-
* office of the A. D. T. company, and when he

~.‘He' struck a match to look at the address on

where he was going. His heels struck the edge
of an inclined cellar ﬂap, he lost his balance and
fell back upon- it. The wood must have been
rotten from age, for the boards gave way with
a crash and he was precipitated headlong into

‘a dark void below.

He landed on a light framework that broke his

fall and collapsed under his weight, letting him V‘
down comparatively easy, but not so easy that his

wits were sent wool gathering.

The tin box crashed down beside him, and»

lay under the debris. The rain came pelting in
through the broken flap, and soon pools of water
began forming on the cellar ﬂoor. Messenger 99,
however, had been thrown just out of their reach,
and he lay dazed and motionless in the wreck of

the framework. Five minutes later he, beganto /

move and ﬁnally sat up. -
“What in thunder happened to me, and Where

am I at?’ Fred asked himself, as he looked‘

around in the dense darkness which surrounded
him. In a moment or two his thoughts collected
themselves and_he recollected hisfall.

“I must be in the cellar of the house,” he said.  '

He listened, but the only sound that strucklon

his ears was the rain coming down forall it was. - :
worth. It pattered loudly on the remains of the '

wooden cellar ﬂap.
“Where has my package got to?”

He got up, fumbled in his pocket for a match, ‘  I

struck it and looked around. He saw the" box
sticking out from amid the splintered wood and
hastened to recover it. '

“Now howam I going to get outof this cellar?" I

he asked himself, for he saw there were no steps

under the broken ﬂap. “I’ll have to look around‘

for a box, push it under the holeand climb out.
No use doing that till the rain stops, but that

won’t be long. In the meantime I'll look for‘ a 

box.”

He lighted another match and began to inves-
tigate the cellar. He soon saw that the founda-

tion of the house was probably divided in sections, ,  '1
and he was in one of them, for the space, sur-. 

rounded by stone walls, was very small. There
was nothin

communicated with somewhere else. It was closed

tight, and as there was no handle to it he found. I

that his way in that directionrappeared to be
blocked. Then how was he goin to get out of
the place, for the opening throug which\he had
tumbled was several feetabove his head?

He scratched his head and considered. Thenihe‘ I ' 
‘ .put down the package, pulled out his jack-knife, >

opened therlarge blade and tried to insert ‘the’
point between the edge of the door and the jamb.

There was some play to the door, but it'wou‘ldn’t.-

Aevralvboxes standing around, two of which com-

9 ibined he judged would enable him to get out of
the place by the opening he had made by accident.
He selected two of the boxes and carried them
"into place where he fell. It was still raining hard

I so he was in no hurry to leave. He sat down to
.. wait for it to let up. .

j “It’s,—a wonder the people in the house didn’t
hear the racket I made coming down here. May-
 be the noise of the rain prevented the sound
reaching their ea1‘S,’_"l1€ mused. “I wouldn’t like
them .to catch me here, for they might take me

on’? Is there anything wrong about the people

reasonable. Yet they must have been doing some-

I ‘,F_1'~ed pondered over the situation and finally
‘decided to look around a. little and see if there
' was anything that looked suspicious. He retuimed

  
 
  

fsaw another iron door which was closed. This
,had',an iron knob to it and was not fastened. [Op-
ening it he ﬂashed the match into a third cellar
't:one end of which he saw a wooden stairway
Ieajdingto the groundﬂoor above. He ventured
up-the shortﬂight and found an ordinary door
‘ﬁefore him. It was not locked or otherwise se-
.cu_red;,so he stepped cautiously into an entry. He

the following paragraph:

ON SOUTH STREET. Officer Larkins, while

found a man lying in a sprawling attitude in the
'' gutter on the west side of South street on the

’ curing assistance carried the man to the station

‘hands and neck were heavily tanned from ex-

CHAPTER V.—~In A Bad Fix.

, .When Fred recovered his senses he was sur-
prised to ﬁnd himself in some dark place with his
arms bound behind his back. He was in a sitting
position with his backagainst a stone wall, and
hiszfeet stretched out before him. It didn’t take

him long to ﬁgure out that he was a prisoner, and V

_-" l he judged that he was in the cellar of the manor
. house, His supposition was correct, for that was
whe're»lie was. i .
_ ,“I hope Bennie got away with that paper,” he
. said to himself. “Then he could bring the police
‘ here and rescue the girl and me, too.”
Unfortunately Bennie failed to get away with
I the paper, and was a prisoner, like himself, not
‘six feet away from him at that moment, but still
unconscious from the knock he had received.
Fred tried to get on» his feet, and discovered that
' I ' ‘something held him down. This something was
.the slack end of the rope that held his hands,
which was tied to a ring in the wall.
— ,‘»‘I‘seem to be up against it,” he muttered. “I
 ' uess. I’m here to stay till somebody comes and
W rees me.” i . i
r ' .A_couple of ‘hours passed slowly and drearily
away, and then Fred heard something move not
far from him. His first impression was that it

_..f‘That door leads into the kitchen,” said Fred.
v “I hear someone in there,” whispered Bennie.
Somebody was rattling dishes and walking
around. Fred peeked through the keyhole and
caught a ﬂeeting glimpse of a hard-looking wom-
an, who seemed to be the cook and probably gen-
eral domestic.
r “We can't go in there,” said Fred, “for she’s
' doubtless hand-in-glove with the rascals who
make this house their rendezvous.” _
it “‘.What are we going to do,_then? There_ 1S no
other way of getting out of this place we're in.”

.“We’ll have to return to the cellar and try and
getout through the flap that I broke the other
night,” said Fred. T
,- They went back into the cellar. The impris-
. oned ‘rascal’ was making a great noise, kicking
-‘against the woodwork and trying to force the
door by throwing his body against it. Fred led the
way to the iron door through which he had en-
tered the main cellar two nights before. The
catch was on it, and the boy threw it off,‘ giving
them entrance to the coal hole. The boxes he had
gclizsed had been removed, and the ﬂap repaired. It
*'’‘*‘?‘was secured by means of a heavy clasp held in
place.by an iron pin, and as this was inside it of-
fered no obstacle to the boys’ escape that way.

Fred’ rushed back to get a couple of boxes so
‘they could climb up and reach it. Before he could
secure them the cellar door opened, and he wom-
appeared. She had been attracted by the noise
the man was making and had come down to ﬁnd
out the" cause of it, though she knew the rascal

CHAPTER VII.——Agnes Wilson.

Reaching the kitchen, nothing stood between
them and freedom but the door, and this was not
locked. Fred, however, did not intend to leave the
house without trying to rescue the girl prisoner’;

“You're taking chances," said Bennie, when‘
his friend told him of his purpose. “There maybe ‘
other men in the house.”

“I”don’t care, Bennie.

“That fellow may break out of the bin, and
then we’ll havehim to deal with, too.” V

“We’ll lock the door here that communicates
with the cellar,” replied Fred.

When he started to do this he found there we.
no key in the lock, consequently it couldn’t be_

locked-. ,
“We’ll have to barricade it,” he said. “Help
me push the table against it.” , i _ .:
“That won’t hold it against a man,” said‘ 
Bennie, after they had blocked the door.

lt’s our duty to save it

“Then we must use something else in addition," .. ~

said Fred. .
There were two chairs in the kitchen,‘ but they _
were not heavy enough to help matters much; i s '
There was) a coal-scuttle, partly ﬁlled, and Fred ’
told Bennie to shove that up against the door

“I’1l tell you what.we’ll do. We’ll get thev
chairs in the dining-room and brace‘ the ‘table
with them and the kitchen ones,” said Fred, 1.. V 1-

He led the way to the dining-room, the table ‘
of which showed that a meal had lately been
eaten there. How many persons had eaten that
meal he could not tell. ’ A 7 _.

“Grab a chair, Bennie, and fetch it alongﬂsaid 
Fred, lifting one himself. They carried the four ‘
chairs into the kitchen and braced the table with .
them. That blocked the door completely against F
anyone tr ing to force it open from the other
side. If t e’ rascal in the bin succeeded iz_i.get-, ,
ting free he could not reach them by way of that '
‘door to save his life. But he could get out of
the cellar through the coal-hole and the ﬂa ,ljust "
as Fred had started to-do himself ‘with ennie,
and then enter the house through the kitchen
door. That possibility occurred to.Fred, so-as ‘a \;
precaution he locked the door. - . p. 

“Now, come on ” he said to his companion.

They passed through the dining-roomvintoa
sitting—room or parlor beyond. This room, which
was, bare of furniture, was at the front of the
house and overlooked‘ the lawn and the street. _

Fred was a boy always willing to do anyone
a favor, so he grasped the man and suppo
him up the alley to the stable, where there was -
a chair in front of the door., The man dropped :
into the chair and closed his eyes. 1 - ’

Fred.

Fred looked in the_ dark and horsey-smelling
shed, and saw the sink at one end, with a» tin
cup on a shelf. He walked over to get the water.

He had to pass under the edge of an open loft. -,
As he did so a heavy‘bag fell on him, and carried,‘
him to the floor. Fortunately the blow, was at‘
glancing one, but even at that he was dazed by
the shock. The man who had said he 'was'il_l

time after asking for water for he followed-the‘ ~

was doing it, and realized what was going on.
Before he could make a struggle the man;fou"1,id
the package he was after, put it in his pock
and got up. ” ‘ i I '

“All right,” he said. “I’ve got it.” ‘ “

He hurried back to the chair and sat do .

“Sorry for you, young fellow. You got iutpgqod

Fred recognized his voice as that of the

that they tallied. The conclusion he reached was

i “The evidence seems to be against you. I’ll

the sergeant of the prisoner.

" . The man refused to give either his name or ad-
dress so the o-ﬂicer at the desk wrote “John Doe”
in the blotter. Other questions were put to him,

g ; some of which he answered. Fred’s name and ad-
. ,. .dress were taken down, and as the thief was led

'  {away to a cell, Messenger 99 was told to appear
~ , at the police court next morning to testify against
~ the prisoner. The police kept the box of jewelry

 {to produce against the rascal, so all Fred could
fiio. was to call on the lady and report what had
/xlinppened. She was prosperous and Fred’s story
 put her in a great predicament.

 She was preparing to attend some important
';social function that evening and wanted the dia-
'.;_nonds to wear. There was no chance of her get-
‘ing -them, however, and so she blamed the boy
for allowing“ himself to be robbed, threatening to
f—rcport_;him to the company. Messenger 99 didn’t
._think he deserved the call-down.

5 “Most any one would have been fooled by the
game that chap worked on me,” he protested.
. “He worked his scheme so naturally that I never
uspected anything. I think I deserve some credit
r- recovering the package.” .
 Thelady would not be placated because she was
isappointed. Sher declared she would counter-
_;mand the order for the jewelry, as she had made
' the purchase particularly for the occasion. That
’,didn’t worry Fred any, as he was not interested
n the sale. He went to a public telephone station

ternati'<SI1'.' The bricks ﬁrst landed on a hard

ﬁotvhurt. His shoes dropped out of his hand and

UP $50,000,000 HOARD‘ = 

A treasure of gold, silver and diamonds valued»
at $60,000,000 buried in Bolivia is the subject of
the prospectushof a new company ﬂoated in Lone.

ﬁnance an expedition to retrieve the hoard. 
_ An_e2_<pedit1on of eighteen Englishmen, includ-'

says the_ prospectus circulated in the city. The"-
party will be under direction of Dr. Edgar San—.

be completed in October. , ‘

T e treasure is said to be buried in«a hillside.

leased the ranch for three years. One-fo th' of ~

rest to the company ﬁnancing the expedition. The  7'
company is called the Sacambaya Exploration
Company and the prospectus stresses the point N
that is a speculation, not investment. ' ~

The story of the treasure begins when Bolivia  .-
belonged _to Spain and was called Upper 1?eru.:m
Jesuits used to work the gold mines there with,
Indian slaves until‘ about 1778, when they wer"
ordered deported by the Spanish Government. »

For eleven years previously Spain had prevent-
ed the Jesuits exporting any of their,treasure to ,
Europe, but the order continued to work the gold.‘
and silver mines and a diamond wash during that

One of the deported Jesuits, Father~Grego.rio,. ~
San Roman, had a brother who was ‘Prefect. of
Callao, Peru. On his way out of‘ the country
Father Gregorio told the Prefect where the trees
ure was buried. The Prefect left documentstell
ing the secret to his ‘son,’ who later became Presi

TESLA ANNOUNCES Has INVENTED TINY

Nikola Tesla, inventor and electrical ‘wizard, .
has entered the field of aviation and believes he 
has solved the problem of, making the_mai'i in the
street a man in the sky’ cheaply and with per-,,,
fec_t safety. He says he has invented a “ﬂivve:g-2!,‘
ﬂying machinewliich can be sold for “much_less”_
than $1,000, will weigh only 500,pounds, can-‘rise
vertically, travel. forward. at high speed and. 'bg
landed, if necessary, “through an open window?’ j

The window, Mr. Tesla, who is nearing seventy’?-
two, hastened to explain, must be “atleast eight
feet wide” because his two-man “air -ﬂivver”. W1.
be eight feet long. eight feet wide and eight; feet
high. Two United States patents, itwas learned.
through Munn & Co., patent attorneys, of No.1-2:4»
West 40th Street, have just been issued on the
device, which Mr. Tesla calls ta “helicopter-air-,
plane,” although the original _~ application was
made more _than seven years ago. f ,' ~ A
