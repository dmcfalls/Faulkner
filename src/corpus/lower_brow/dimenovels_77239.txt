 DONE WITH A l CLICK;

The Mystery of the Painted Arm.

By the Author of “NICK CARTER."

CHAPTER I.
THE HUB AND cnv.

“Stop him!”
. “Yes, if you can ﬁnd him!”
‘ , “Ten dollars to know who he is!”

"It’s worth it!“

“Twenty to get my grappling hooks on
him!" -

“If you made it ﬁfty, Red Jeff,
’twou1dn’t fetch—-"the kid has vanished,
neck and heels ”

Red Jeﬁ, ex-smuggler, ex-pirate, wharf

. rat, king of the river thieves of New
York city, ground his teeth in rage.
“Call the boys 1” he growled, hoarsely.
“They’re coming,” announced his
companion.
_ l-*3-Line the river—the runaway made for
cover that way. ”
Hot on the heels of the two men who
had Jjust dashed into view, four brawny
fellows earne forward, puﬁng and pant-

 '“Like.‘a puﬁ-of smoke,” put in his

It’s the snuggery broken up if that spy
gets free——it’s dodge and slurk, and ﬁn-
ally coxne slap up against "the beaks. In
ﬁve years not a stranger has passed the
threshold of our den, unchallenged, till
this fellow did. ”

“He couldn't have been in the house
ﬁve minutes. ”

“Two was enough for him. "

“To tumble over every scrap of writ-

secret rpom. "

“That’s bad!"

“Pretended to be a plumber’s assist-
ant, come to mend a leak. I found an
envelope he had some solder in. "

“Then you yelled-——"

“And scared him into ﬂight like the
wind. Yell! so would you, for that envel-
ope contained an address telling who he
was from."

“Who?”

“Nick Carter."

A dead silence fell over the group. A
rough, coarser set of __faces could not well

-be gathered together, yet more than one
paled under the bronze of exposure and p

the hardened recklessness of crime.

A spy, a detective, a representative of
the man whom they feared personally

Flat to the ﬂoor went Red Jeff, upset-
ting a chair and half overturning the
table, and at the racket, the man's yell
for help, the rush of startled feet, the
spry intruder sprang for a window,
darted toward the river, and vanished.

The brawny giant glared now across
the stretch of territory intervening be-
tween himself and the river.

A large transfer dock comprised it.

At one end of the wharf a steam scow
was driving piles.

Beyond that a barge had just chuted
its load of grain into an elevator.

Nearer were two buildings about a bun»
dred and ﬁfty feet apart.

One was four stories high, a storage .
warehouse; the other was a low shed-like
building. ‘

From the higher to the lower struc-
ture, set on trestles, ran what might be
termed a freight tohoggan slide. -

Down this from a third story platform
to that of. the shed, a lot of boxes con-

taining salted ﬁsh had been in progress

of transportation for river reshipmeut.
All tliis~Red Jeff took within the scope
of an anxious, piercing glance.

“Him: every crack and corner,"he

ordered. “We’ve got to get that spy l"
» Font of his gang deployed toward the
river. Red Jeff and his companion pro»-
cee‘ded down the planking that marked a
roadway. ‘ 4 »

They looked to the right and the left.
Then Red Jeff gave a jump. forward, as
at a spot where a pile of bricks and a box
of mortar stood a form came into view.

It was apparently that of one of the
laborers employed inﬁxing a chimney of
the warehouse. . l c

He wore a well white-washed hat. lime
strgaked his clothing, and he carried a
ho . ' « » '

“ItA’s~hirn!” declared Red Jeﬁ.

never betrayed so much as a quiver if he
suspected.

'But just as four claw-like hands went »

_out not t_wo feet behind him he gave a
_ spring that was half a. whirl.
DI-Ie kept whirling and spinning around
like a top, the hod suddenly outstretched

 of his men at the dock edge.

needed, he sought to evade an unequal
contest, for all three men were now corn-, ' I 
ing up the ladder. * H‘ 

The platform and the slide were smooth
as glass. Both were waxed, and a mere
touch moved a box as if rolling over ice.

The fugitive pushed one to the edge of
the slide, sprang upon it, directed a swift
glance at his pursuers, and then raising
the hooked pole,‘ drove it clear through
the cover of the box.

He had now something more than a
vehicle to shunt him one hundred and
ﬁfty feet from his enemies with a bird’s
swiftness.

The ﬁxed pole. was a mast to cling to
——a stay, a support. a

With a whir and a swish the box tilted
own the incline, ‘made a shoot that took '
the rider’s breath away. ‘

The dating adventurer ever looked
behind. The vivid rush d‘ ir drove his
hair back from his‘face like ﬂoating rib-

Then perhaps fifty feet accomplished,
as he saw something he had not antici-
pated,\his keen face took a sudden token
of alarm. \ y ' .

He discerned why work had been tem-
porarily snspended in transporting the
boxes. ’

Where the slide made a slight curve to
break thevelocity of descending objects
and to strike the receiving platform be-
low just right,'a sideboard was out of
place.

The sharp contact of the corner of some
box had shattered it awry-—he could see
the wreck of both in the yard below.

Would he graze it?-whirl-x .Co¢nld; he

breathing spell and cast up accounts." ' ' '
Bob had a queer method of following
out this procedure, for it entailed a brisk . _,
run.  .
He got out of the vicinity and out of
the district without attracting attention.

When he halted, it was in a stable
yard back of a modest little house that
looked like the home of some teamster
or cabman.

On the back steps, sunning himself,
was a bright-faced. neat appearing young '
fellow about Bob’s own age.

“Hello, Bob!” he -spoke, with a keen
stare at his friend's lime-streaked, water-

sogged attire. , ...
“Hello, Buﬁ!” the new arrival hailed
back. ,.

Buﬁ was a recent addition to Nick Car-
ter’s detective household. .
Bob had the reputation of being the
shrewdest and most successful juvenile in ,
the school, but Buff was fast following .~ .
in his footsteps.
,Ernployed by the veteran thief-catcher
to carry messages, Buff had been of the *
most brilliant service in several recent
cases,‘ and Nick, discerning in him a
genuine diamond in the rough, had taken
him professionally under his wing. . y

CHAPTER 111’.
THE REVOLVING ROOM.

“Be cautious, Bob!”
“Yes, Buﬁ, we mustn‘t lose what

_ we’ve gained by any false break now."

It was exactly three hours after Nick
Carter‘s young detectives had so cleverly
camped in a successful and unique way
right on the trail of the harbor thieves.

They had been so near to a little ceil-
ing winddw looking into the den of the
river thieves that they had been able to
see everything going on. d‘

When it had been casuallyhooked back-
to give ventilation, they had heard nearly
every word spoken. *

Those words had been enlightening, for L

they told the eager listeners that at pre-
cisely ten o’clock picked members of‘ Red
Jeﬁ’s gang were going by water to earn
two‘ thousand dollars by a few hours’
work. i
Those words had been stimulating, for
as the crowd retired from the room under
inspection to repair to some secret lair far
to the’ rear, Bob had. insisted on creep-
ing through _ that little window and fol-
lowing them up.

“They may slip out any one of a dozen

secret exits, and all our work will beiforv

nothing,” he declared. _ ‘
“You «hope. to keep with _them’?” in-
“I want‘ to,.see. how and where they
start from,”'a’nswered Bob. “If we ean‘t

‘ do that we’re,left, aren't “we ?” i

“Iigueas you're right, Bob, but we’re

diving into a. nest of pitfalls "

“All in the line of detective duxynf ob-
served Bob tersely. “One miss and
they’re off, and the job's done, tracks
covered up, and mystery too deep for us

grating jar.

Bob pressed on the brick work one way‘,
then the other way.

“Locked!” he reported.

“Locked!” echoed Buﬁ, grimly.

“Some catch ahead of us._, Ican half
understand it,’p’ muttered Bob.

“Can you ?” questioned Buff. .

“Yes. We should have pushed the
cylinder around and unset the lock on its
outside before we started. That's the
knowing way of it, must be. You’re
right, it's a trap—for the inwary.“

Bob shied the feeble rays aloft——solid.
He tapped at the brickwork front two
inches away—solid, too.

“I don’t ever remember being in quite
so tig.it a box before,” he observed.

“What’s bothering me, is that those
fellows will get away on their scheme, "
complained Buff.

“Oh! we'll be brought to light long’

before they start,“ promised Bob. .

“And then?”

Bob hunched his shoulders philosophi-
cally.

He did not give up entirely until he
had spent fully an hour working to get
the cylinder revolving again, tlg bricks
in the wall loose, a scam‘ in the’ bottom
widened. ‘

It was all of no avail, and he had just
made up his mind that this wasa barrier
set against entrance to the front till the
next morning, when voices sounded. then
footsteps, aid then the revolving room
began its to r again.

“Pnsh'—-hold back the way we came!”
whispefed Bob, energetically. A

He and Buff bruised and jammed their
ﬁngers trying it-a steady force had u_n_.
locked and was hauling the cylinder
around the way they did not wish to go,

“Is it tight, Bob?" interrogated Buff.

“To the death, or get killed,” an-
swered Bob, grimly.

aﬁorded of grouped enemies, only now
aware of their proximity.

Then the cylinder was sent whirling.

For all the world like squirrels ina
drum cage, the boys spun around and
around. , '

Then came a jerk back, forward, and
back again, carrying them off their feet,
slamming them against the iron walls
and over one another.

rates were employing these tactics of con-

“They can’t get after us." ~

“Not through that revolving room—-

Quick, Buff! Welllv”

Dodging across‘ the room to open its
opposite door and make tracks the way
they had come, Bob halted very sharply. ‘

Just as he touched the knob, the door
jarred.

‘At that very instant heavy bolts top
and bottom were shot into place on its
other side.

“’I‘hey.’ve telegraphed their friends in
front—-——" began Bob.

“And we're shut in," nodded Buﬁ.
“What now, Bob?" '

“The windows. “ _

“Not that way——1ook out first."

- “Pshaw!" "

Bob drew back. They were a well
drilled set in this den of‘ crime, it seemed
for under each of the ally windows of the
room as many men were already posted in
an attitude of vigilance and expectancy.

On three sides the apartment was now
surrounded or barricaded.

Naturally ‘the young detectives made
for the sole direction from which danger
had not challenged. r

A door yielded to a touch. Acrossa
dark room Bob proceeded to reach a
seconddoor, but this one was secured. .'

Tramping footsteps and noisy voices
suddenly ﬁlled the air all around them.

“This room is no better than the other
one ” began Buﬁ.

“Unless we can hide. ”

“Here's a bed.“

“Creep under it. "

“There is no under. ”

“How's that?” spoke Bob, gliding to
his coinrade’s side. “Oh, a folding bed,
spring, blankets. Under them! some  ,.
is certainly coming.” i "

heavy feet crossed the ﬂoor. "In there,

Then he was snaked out rudely, the

“Settled !" whispered Buﬁ across to his
companion.

“It looks it,” nodded Bob.

There was no light in the room except
that which came in through the curtains.

At one side was a stove, and a roasting
hot ﬁre in it, but it was shut up, and only
a few stray glints came from it. ‘

Besides this, some clothing spread out
on two chairs before it as if to dry shut
in the front of the stove.

Red Jeﬁ’s lieutenant came into the
room abruptly. Be lit the gas, and sat
down on a stool near the stove, which '
was between the boys and the doorway.

“Tie their hands behind them,” he "
ordered the two men.

Some stout cord was wrapped around
the wrists ‘of each of the captives.

“Put one in that corner of the alcove,
the other opposite. ”

This also was done. The man with
the bandaged head made a gesture to the
two men, and they slouched into the next
room and out of it.

“Now for a pleasant evening,” spoke
Red Jeﬁ’s lieutenant. “I cau’t. join in
the fun of a sail, so we‘ll have some
sport at home. First, who are you two?”

An iron bar used as a poker lay by
the stove. ~ , _ ‘

This the man took up. He weighted
it, he felt of it, he clinched it ominously
as he ﬁxed lurid, savage eyes on the
captives. . .. . i .

Bob noticed that near at ‘hand was his
revolver. \ R

its muzzle protruded from the pocket
of the man’s~coat. which hung smoking
on the chair at his side.

Bob had knocked him into a puddle of
mud when he struck him with the hod,
and the garment had been sponged and
hung up to dry. v ,

for in less than ten minutes. four men
arrived, got into the boat, took up the
oars, and started down the river.

From their voices Bob was enabled to
guess that Redrjeff was not among them.

From bits of their conversation over-
heard as they progressed, he soon learned
that the king of the harbor pirates was in
waiting at=one of their “wharf tunne1s”
ready to receive their cargo when they
returned.

The night had set in misty and with
the air full of fog. Bob's chance to peer
was limited, and he had to guess out the
course the yawl was taking.

It passed the Battery, went down the
bay, and after two hours’ rowing slowed
up slightly.

Then it- grazed some object, apparently
the side of a ship, was halted there, and
Bob could see a yellow lantern among
the rigging of quite a large vessel.

Not a, word had been spoken by the
rowers for some time. but one of them,
in a suppressed voice, now directed:

“Signal, Bill. ”

A low, peculiar whistle sounded out.
Then the boat rocked, as over the side of
the vessel a form came down a rope.
 “Who is it?” inquited the new ar-
rival, trying to scan the faces of the
rowers. - —

“The Susan——Red Jeﬁ-—come for a7

cargo. "'

' “Quite correct. It’s all, ready, boys.

Make your yawl steady, lower and corn: _ ‘

below and have abracer for a hard night’:
work.” i '
“Not much time to. waste, cap’en.”
“Oh! no one will trouble you. Why,"
half laughed the speaker, “I worked the
game of my mate down with the "yellow
fever so that all three passengers I didn’t
want in the way payed handsomely to he
landed dowxrthe coast. The plague ship
racket, the. yellow lantern, keeps all
meddlers at safe bay, and this fog will

cover box and boat like a shroud going   

back. ”.

The yawl was secured by ropes to they  in

side of the vessel, fore and aft.

he meant to do something with it, and
ordered Buﬁ: ’

“Row, now.”

“Ahead?”

(tYeS.H

“But we’ll run into the side of one of
those barges?"

“Don ’t de1ay——do as I say! That’s just
what I want.”

Two things urged Boh’s tones up to
unusual sharpness.

In the ﬁrst place, he had a scheme in
view, and running into the barge meant
its initial step.

In the next,‘ there was an outcry back
in the mist-laden gloom—the loss of the
yawl Susan had been discovered.

Buﬁ would have obeyed Bob‘s orders if

the latter had directed him to row into a "

maelstrom.

He drove the oars deep, and the yawl
promised to strike the last of the sand
barges just ahead of its stern. . V

“Reverse!” suddenly called out Bob.-

As he spoke, the rope ﬂung wide of his
grasp with a graceful swoop of its looped

end. i

Canning up from the rear of the barge
were the ends of a dozen or more posts,
so revealed because the top sheathing
board had come off.

The loop caught on oneiof theses  . r

dropped to a. seat.
“Hold steady-‘we're

Then it swung to the rear, the holding
line came taut, and it went forward true
and straight as an arrow.

Bob uttered a decided sigh of relief and ‘

satisfaction; Buff’: face expanded into _a

Two minutes after they had reached
Nick Carter’s house, that place was a
scene of vivid animation.

The box was carried into the large
sitting-room and placed on a big table.

Nick advised of his favorite’s return
“with news”——such was the message Bob
called up through Nick’s private speak-
ing-tuhe——came down promptly.

Jack Burton, Aleck White and Larry
Moore, other members of the detective
school, tumbled out of their beds in short
order, as Nick tapped at their doors and
gave them the hint that “something was
up.” -

Bob rattled off the essential points in
the doings of the night clearly, but with
brevity.

There could be no doubt~——all hands
conceded—-but that the box contained
stolen or smuggled goods of immense
value.

Nick examined it curiously. Its cover
was only lightly nailed down and a screw-
driver loosened it so that strong Jack
Burton, getting his giant-hinged ﬁngers
under it, ripped it off with very little
effort. "

Perhaps six more interested faces "never
peered down into a surprise box.

A counterpane showed, snugly tucked
in} three-quarters of the length of the
x. .

Its remaining space was covered with a
piece of ﬁlmy gauze. ,

A deadening’ taint was noticed proceed-
ing from the box as it was first opened, . _.
and now a cloud of it arose lstnpefyingly. 1-.

After drawing back slightly to wait for i 
this to dissipate, all ﬁve young detectives ~ ‘»
pressed ‘forward with renewed eagerness, «
as Nick lifted up the piece of gauze.

A simultaneous cry of motley import
rang out.

 Even Nick Carter himself was slightly
-startled at this unexpected revelation, and
stood silently gazing down at the queer
,. cargo of “the night for some time.

, Bobwas greatly excited and surprised-

‘to his quick mind here at the seeming

[Bud looked slightly disappointed. He

 and dazzling. '

the United States with some secret or
secret power. An enemy or a friend who

has wronged him, learns of it. He bribes '
[the captain of the ship to never allow

him to land in New York city, to deliver
him up to him. This captain scares his
other passengers away by claiming to
have yellow fever aboard. He drugs and
boxes up this man. Red Jeﬁ, hired by
the enemy, goes to get him. He missed
connections, you checkmated him, and--
to-morrow this man will tell us his whole
story. ”

Bob was forced to be content with this.
He helped Nick and the others carry the
man to an upstairs chamber.

There they gently disrobed him, placed
him in a comfortable bed, and Nick
opened all the windows in the room.

“Give him time and plenty of air, and
we’ll have him chatting with us at lunch
to-morrow,” prophesied the detective.

“Oh, Bob! set his collar and wristbands

loose. Help nature, it is the only restora-
tive in these noxious tropical drugs."

“I say, Mr. Carter!”

Freeing the patient’s neck and one
arm, Bob gave quite a start as he came to
the other arm.

The wristband tlapped loose, revealing
a queer state of affairs beneath.

Beginning at his wrist, there ran up
the man’s arm a solid stain——-jet black.

Bob traced‘ it to the elbow and saw

that it reached apparently clear up to the

shoulder. .
He directed Nick's attention to it.
“I call that queer!” declared Bob.

“So do I,” admitted Nick. “It is no
-bruise or natural discoloration. The arm
is painted." 

“Painted !" ejaculated Bob.

“Yes. )1

“What for?”

“I should say for some burn, or to pre-
vent the spread of some ‘poisﬂn sting or
bite. It is a dense pigment, and will wash
off. Leave that till to-marrow. too, Bob.
We’ve got the case and the man now
thoroughly in our own hands, and can eat-
ploit its mysteries at our leisure."

“Yon wonldn’t try to hunt up Red Jeff

i It was hard getting to sleep, however.
i -~'Bob had been used to going through
i with a case at lightning speed, once
started in on it, and the present wait,
brief and natural as it was, irritated him.
He was sure that some great plot would
be unmasked through the queer human
cargo he had intercepted, some strange
; mystery appended to that painted arm.
,* He was ﬁghting for its possession in
;i his dreams with Red Jeﬁ just after sun-
-rise, when he was roused up by a vigor-
ous shaking at the hands of Buff.

“Buff, I feel we’re wasting valuable
time!” he declared, emphatically. ‘‘I‘m
going out to search for that man. "

At the door, however, he came face to
face with the detective himself.

Bob only glanced at Nick once, to
know that. he had no particularly good
news to report.

“You haven’t found him, Mr. Carter?"
he projectetd, anxiously.

“No, but I have set some machinery
in motion that may help us accomplish
that result. Had your breakfast?“

“I couldn't eat."

“Go and get it."

Bob knew his patron's way. He would
not speak further till the day was started
right——with a good square meal.

“Now, Mr. Carter," reported Bob,
entering the library a few minutes later,
“I’m ready to go on the track of that
man.”

“All right, Bob, that is what I intend
you shall do. 'l‘he police are looking for
him on description."

“We can't rely on that. Y’

“No, we have a better clue. ”

“Eh ?" cried Bob, pricking up his ears.

“What do you say to that?"

Nick handed over the latest edition of
a morning newspaper.

It was folded across an advertisement
page. _

Taking up double space in the Lost
and Found column was the following:

“Five hundred dollars reward. The
above sum will be paid for any informa-
tion that will lead to the discovery of
James Singleton, lost last night from the
bark Abdallah, off Quarantine.—-dead or
alive.” ‘

An accurate description of the man the
young detectives had found in the box
followed. ‘ '

But it was at the name of the person
oﬁering the reward that Bob gazed keen-
ly, eagerly.

“Apply to Victor Rhodes, Temple
Block.”

That was Bob Ferret's clue.

body. James Singleton, on board the

_ Abdallah, disappeared last night, accu-
M rate description given.

Eh ?H

“’I'elephone, sir.”

The ofﬁce boy had interrupted. Rhodes
stepped into the next room.

“Who is it 2” Bob heard him ask.
“Oh! you, father? What-—what! Found ?
Got him? l’ll be home right off. Fa-
mous!”

Lawyer Rhodes came back into the
inner oﬂice one vast glow of chuckling
satisfaction, of half-suppressed excite-
ment.

Bob, under the surface, was quite as
actively inoved, but he did not show it.

Rhodes bundled a lot of papers into a
drawer and hurriedly drew on his over-
coat.

“Oh !" he remarked, observing Bob,
“thought you had gone. About that
hoax? As‘I said, nothing to it."

“But you didn’t say-—-—" began Bob.

“Then‘I say it now. Some malicious
or mischievous person inserted that Sin-
gleton advertisement. We don’t even
know the name. All a sell, a jol:e—see?"

Rhodes hustled Bob out of the otiice,
gave a sharp order to the boy in charge,
and was down the elevator before Bob
could get in another word.

“They've found him—they’ve got
Singleton!”

All the affected simplicity of a rather
stupid fellow out of work and running
down all kinds of prospects to get it, dis-
appeared like magic from Bob's face.

I-lis visit to the law_ver‘s office had been
timely, resultful. ..

That telephone message incautiously
repeated by the excited Rhodes, had
given _Bob a sure clue. ‘ .

There was not the slightest doubt in
Bob's mind but that Singleton had-_ fallen
into the hands of his enexnies, ‘

Just committed some singular crime——Bob
knew this, but was not yet clear as to its
entire import.

Singleton had reached the bottom of
the stone steps. ,

From all Bob could discern, he had un-
dergone no change.

The pallor had left his face, the excite-
ment had faded from his eyes. Except for
a certain dazed pncertainty of manner, he
looked and acted perfectly natural.

Glancing up street, down street, he
started suddenly forward, passing Bob on
a rapid walk.

Bob paid no attention to him that
could attract the notice of the people at

after proceeding several squares, caught
up with him. .

It was—click!
Bob started and peered keenly.
Then he uttered a vivid cry of alarm

and dismay.

. Across the court, just retreating from
avwindow on a perfect level with Single-.
ton’s niicovered arm, was a man.

At a glance Bob recognized hiin——-Vic-
tor Rhodes!

In his hand the lawyer held a camera.

lts shuttenliad caused the click.

It _had opened, closed, to take a ﬂash-
ing photograph.

James Singleton ‘s enemies‘ and Bob
Ferret’s enemies had gained possession
of the secret of the painted arm !

Bob did not wait to see if the doctor
connected man, camera and patient.

The recognition of Singleton, the snap

' of the shutter, an instant conipreheiisioii

of the fact that he had been followed by
people from the» Rhodes house, urged
him up to impulsive action.

He was out of the room. down the ball,
around to the corridor fronting the oﬁices
opposite in a ﬂash.

Elevators, two sets of stairways, rooms
above, and rooms lielow——-Bob realized
that a person could lose himself in a
twinkling in this vast busy hive.

He dove, therefore, for the office
where he had seen Rhodes with the cam-
era. ,

x'He knew it by a glance across the A
court where the doctor and his patient’
were in full view. .

Three young fellows, clerks, were in _
the oﬂice. One was counting over some
billsand cliiickling, the others. were
watching him covetously.  '

Bob took a hurried, glance around.

He ran so hastily up to the young fel-
lowgwitli the money, that the latter put
the bills behind him as if deeming him a
thief. *' ‘ »

“Quick!” urged Bob-effdo any of you
fellows know 8 man named Rhodes?" _.

made no mistake, and Dennis directed a
vicious lunge at an adversary he knew
would not let him get away unless dis-
abled. .

Spry Bob evaded the thrust. Warned
and enlightened, he posed to detain the
man who could be in that building for
no good purpose, and for no other pur-
pose, surely, than one connected with
Singleton.

A ﬂashing suspicion told him that both
Rhodes and Dennis must have followed
him step by step. ‘

Just then asharp cry rang out down
the hall. It came from the doctor's office,
and the doctor himself uttered it.

As Bob saw that person stagger through
its doorway, his interest was at once dis-
tracted from Dennis.

The latter instantly sprang down the
stairs, as something in the doctor‘s plight
drew Bob to his side.

“What is it? Speak!” urged Bob.

“I am choking—suﬁocating!
ﬁend! A man entered the oﬂice——-

“It: was Dennis, the Greek physician,”
declared Bob.

“He broke a capsule of some.vile drug
in my face——”

“Singleton? your
harrn~hirn ?’ ’ .

“I do not know.”

Bob rushed through the doorway of
the oﬁce. . e

The man with the painted arm lay
where he had been placed at the first.
There was apparently no change in him.

Bob looked him over, trying to guess
wliy the Greek had entered the room.

Then his eye falling to the arm where"
the stain had just been removed, his
heart sank like lead.

“Knocked out!" he spoke simply, but
expressing volumes. '

At ﬁve o’c1ock Bob struck rare luck.
Passing a railroad ticket oﬂice, he saw
inside the servant of the Rhodes house-
hold.

Bob waited till he came out, entered
the place, and learned that he had just
purchased three return tickets for Fair-
ﬁeld, a town in New Jersey.

Bob guessed what was up. He veriﬁed
it when he arrived at this place the next
day. 1

Two miles away from it was what was
left of the once stately home of the dead
friend of the man with the painted arm——
John Lester.

It had burned down a year pt€\'l0llS.
By dusk Bob knew that it was to this *
spot that the photographed writing al-
luded, for the two Rhodes. their servant
and Dennis arrived on -the evening train.

They carried several tightly done up
packages that looked as if they might
contain tools, and gave out at the village
hotel that they were going to camp out
in the vicinity for a day or two.

This was how it was that Bob had en-
deavored to penetrate their midst, test his —
farmer boy disguise, and pave the way

‘ for picking up a few morsels of informa-

. I
U011.

“They won’t have it, but they never ,
guess who I am,“ he soliloquized, creep-
ing in among a dense patch of thick
bushes. ‘F'l‘hey’re here for John Lester’s
hidden fortune—so am I!” »

How they were going to get it, how he
was going to get it, Bob could not guess,
but his spirits were at a decidedly high
ﬂow. p

A deﬁnite task lay before him-clear:
results were attainable if fortune favored
him. .
The treasure-hunting party had made '
it a point to arrive after dark. .

knew he had found what he was longing
for at last. -

He was not now more than ten feet
distant from the log on which the three
men sat.

' He pricked up his ears diligently as
Dr. Dennis’ hoarse tones reached him:

“What time do we begin operations,
Rhodes?" '

The lawyer consulted his watch.

“Oh, in about two hours."

“Think it's best to wait, eh ?”

“Surely. . Give the’inquisitive Paul
Prys around here a chance to satisfy their
curiosity. They roost early, so we're safe
from interruption after ten o’clocl~:.” '

“Making a good deal of fuss and delay
over a mere job of measurement,” it
seems to me.” remarked Dennis.

“We don’t know that. This screed
isn’t altogether plain. " “
Bo.b’s ﬁnger ends tingled to get hold of

a photograph Rhodes drew out.

V. “Well, yes—some parts are a triﬂe

pretty clear. Oh, well! this is pleasant ,
enough-—a variety from the city, with "

“I fancy the scent‘s blown," observed
the elder.Rhodes, carelessly. “How that
fellow got onto us in the first place ‘I
can't guess." a

“The Nick Carter crowd have,_an un-
pleasant faculty of getting onto most

pieces of wood, and began kicking, drag-

logs down into the depression. A .

Getting it between himself and the
camp-ﬁre, Bob grasped its heavy main
stem and began to climb. 7

All four of the men at the camp-ﬁre
had put after him, but Bob was away up
-aloft, well sheltered by a dense mass of
leaves by the time the_y reached the tree.

The servant and the elder Rhodes ran
on, Dennis and the lawyer poked in about
the vine roots, in and out of the bushes
near by, but never thought of looking
aloft.

_“Where did he go to?" projected pen-
ms.

“He disappeared here,”’declared the
lawyer. “Now, then, what do you make
of that?”

-“It looks suspicious, but still it may
be that prowling ‘apple seller or some
other country gawk, imagining it clever
to pry into other people's business. ”

“The dickens !” whispered Bob to him-
self just here. '

The vine was giving. He clutched a
handful of smaller‘ feelers. These strained,
and he described a quick ascent to save
a drop. '

He had got to the top of the tree now.
Catching one of its jagged sides. he lifted

himself up to a more comfortable posi-.

tion.

Bob sought to balance himself there in
as small a compass as possible.

He swung both feet over down into the
hollow of the tree, and sitting on its edge
wriggled under a canopy of leaves.

“All right now, I guess," he soliJo-
quized——“No, all wrong!” -

Bob‘s hand came swinging around and
down, and with it came a big rotten
piece of the tree.

He fell. sliding forward,’ tried to catch

“Whew !”

Breath and wits se.erned shaken out of

down with startling abruptness. -

-dous. but for the fact that he found his feet

. Groping up, his hand came in contact
with some dangling object.
“Why,” declared the inystiﬁed Bob-
“it's a rope!”
Suclrit was, and he seized it. He had
not noticed it in the rush of his descent.
Bob pulled at it. The strands strained
slightly, but it sustained his weight.
“ Famous !“ he exulted.
' But three feet accomplished, Bob found
his new hopes dashed. ‘

He had come to the narrow part of. the

cavity. '

Through this .he had slid, and if the
tree had beenvﬂat he might have managed
to force through, but, lifting, he saw after
one or two arduous eﬁorts,» that it would

-be an impossibility‘ to wedge past the in-

side trunk bulge.

“Give it up, because llave ‘got to give it -

Bob dropped to the bottom, glad to re-

His predicament, he now decided, was
something more than inconvenience-—-it

was serious- -  A
Unaided, he could certainly not get out"

of that tree, and he had no idea ofappeal-

He now abandoned all hopes of being

Bob Ferret could not afford to lose his
wits,. to take any risks.

He got the papers out of the hollow
tree and grasped Singleton’s arm.

The latter was babbling incoherently
of Brazil, of treasures, of dynamite——
snatches of real and imaginary things-
bnt he went placidly along at Bob’s guid-
aiice.

By the time they ‘had reached the
nearest farmhouse, Bob fancied he guessed

. the mystery of his strange appearance on
' the scene.
:_= . Niel: Carter's doctor had operated on
i-‘ S_ingleton’s head sufficient to help back
his memory in part. ‘
' In some way Singleton must have es-
~ caped and had hurried hither, directed by
half-clouded impulses.

vague idea that it might aid him in biom-

Bob got the farmer out of bed. He told
him enough of the story of the tragedy

Bob placed in Nick Carter's curiosity
cabinet a few days later two ominous nie-
mentoes of his latest case.

One was the photograph of the painted
arm, found at the scene of the explosion.

The other was the little ivory mallet,
secured /at the Greek doctor's oiiice.

They were mute but eloquent reminders
of one of the most perilous shadow trails
ever followed by a member of Nick
Carter's detective school.

THE END. '

The next number of the Nick Carter
Weekly will ‘contain, “Nick Carter's
Junior Force; or, The Man with Four
Arms.”

llllllllllllllfll llll THE STIIEE

   

ESSRS. STREET & SMITH beg to announce to their
patrons and readers of the Nick Carter Series of Detective

    
 
  

Stories the interesting fact that these famous stories will soon be

 
 

produced upon the stage under unusually elaborate circumstances.

 
 

Arrangements have just been completed between the publishers
and Manager F. C. Whitney, to present the entire set of Nick
Carter stories in dramatic form. The idea that will be followed

 
   
 

will be one as original as the stories themselves. A series of plays

 
 

will be presented, one to follow the other, depicting the many

 
   
 

wonderful events in the career of the remarkable detective.

The admirers of this great character will know in advance that

 
 

the stage presentment will be fully up to the interest he possesses

 
    

in the novels. The dramatization will be made by Stanislaus

    

Stange, whose recent dramatization of “Quo Vadis” has raised

him to the foremost ranks of American authors.

  
     

The publishers feel some satisfaction in the fact that the enter-

 
 

prise will be under the management of Mr. F. C. Whitney, whose
magnificent productions during the past ten years have been so

 
   
 

noteworthy events in dramatic annals.

The first play of the series will be brought out next fall.
