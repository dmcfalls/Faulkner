The brokers nodded andipassed on toward the

Nicholas Eastman, with an air of proprietor- I
ship, passed through a swinging gate in the"rail— ,

ting, crossed the room and entered the private

office, where -he took possession of one of’ the*
desks, opened it, and began to study the latest
market report. While he was thus employed,
Brokers VanDyke and Fanning were going down
in one of the elevators. When the cage reached .
the main floor, and they stepped out, they came "'1.
face to face with an exact duplicate of Nicholas 
Eastman-, whom they had left on the floor above.
The two traders gasped, and stared at the young
man as he stepped into the waitin elevator.
_“Why, that’s Eastman,” ejaculated Fanning,
his-eyes bulging with surprise. “ r ‘ ‘ -
“No doubt about that,” nodded—.VanDyke.
“How in thunder could he have got down here “

VanDyke. - [V ;‘ ‘

office, and sitting down at his own. desk, which
backed his brother’s in the centerof the window
space, took up the morning’s Wall Street News
’_and was soon deeply absorbed in its contents.
- Nick and Dick Eastman, the twin boy brokers of
 Wall Street, as they came to be called by the
traders in a short time, looked as much like one
another as two fresh-minted coins. Even their

/ parents, who had their identitiesdown as fine as
2 N any one could have them, sometimes got them mix-
ed up, until- the twins themselves straightened the

matter ut. " -" ' ~' ,

The"‘_ astman twins were born and broug'ht..up

in New York, on a scale ‘that was far from being
,_a grand one‘, for their father, Henry Eastman,
1 had never achieved a higher business "rating than
’:the cashiershipof a big"contr-acting firm. ‘As
, Mr. East‘man’s salary was very faii"and the po-
ﬂ sition a steady one,, the father of the twins. man-
, aged -to provide a comfortable living for his little

= ,zDick graduated at the public school, they paid
- a visit to their father’s only sister, who had re-
’~ cently become a widow, in Boston; ,The result of
‘ the visit was that Nick returned alone, Dick elect-
ing to reinain withhis aunt, who securbd him the
position‘ of messenger in a—- State Street broker’s

 

 
 

  
 

,  New.~York friends, got a ‘similar job in an Ex-
’ change Place broker’s office. For three years the
" ‘twins remained apart, meeting only at Christmas
x'a.1id,during their annual vacations, and devoting
all their energies to learning as much as possible
about the brokerage business. ‘ ' i
 About ten‘ months before the opening of our
story, the twins’ auntin Boston died, and when
her will was opened it appeared that she had left
'D1ck Eastman the; bulk of her. small property,
 amounting to a‘ matter of about $10,000. A Week
later, news came from the West of the death of
.Mrs. Eastman’s mother, and when her will was
 read, it was’found that she had left Nick East-
g . man the sum of. $10,000, putting him on ,a par
 with .his_ brother: The boys, who corresponded
regularly, decided thatthey would go, into the

‘ brokerage business in. New York, under the firm
name of Eastman & Co., as soon as they got hold
of their legacies.

 

 

 
  
 

 Diek threw u his job 'at"tlie Hub andcaine home,
‘where he an Nick perfected their plans, secured
_  anoﬂice in the Orion Building on Wall Street,
' .furnished it up in proper shape, and began opera-
tionson a capital of $20,000.‘

had had much experience as a stenographer.~ ’ ~~ ,
“Not a great deal,” she admitted. “I was- _
cashier in a restaurant for over a’ year, and while‘ ’
there I took lessons three ‘evenings a week at’ an
uptown business school. ’ When I was pronounced‘
proficient enough to take a stenographer’s ,vposi- ’
tion, the proprietor secured me a situation with ‘
a small «manufacturing establishment on Fourth
Avenue.’ 1 was there three months, and no fault ‘
-was found with me. Unfortunately, the firm met,
with business reverses, a receiver took charge,’ ,

and my services were dispensed with. I have now i
been out of work over two months, and as I am. i 
the only breadwiniier at home it is necessary 
that I get something to do as ‘soon as possible.” ’

The girl left the office, and visited several’ ’

when Nick came “ out ‘of the Exchange Building a

the youth, presenting _an envelope.

’“I wonder if Mr. Gaylor and ‘the rest of those

‘‘ something more solid than a _ ream to work_on

,« The fact .of the matter was, that Nick had re-
ceived inside information of the coming advance
i in A. & D. ‘from a thoroughly reliable source, and
— he had’ been on the point of going over to the lit-

it to Nick, saying: '

man, but Wouldn’t like to insure your chances. I '

think you will ‘ﬁnd by the time the option runs
out that the old rams of Wall Street know how
to shear young brokers, as well as lambs.” ’
“Maybe before the diition runs out the ﬁve old

ley and the others in the small pool were sur-
prised, as they had not looked for a rise in the
stock, the indications seeming to point, if any-

thing, the other way. .

They were protected against loss, and" insured
a proﬁt, as Studley had ‘brought the stock at

up to 90. It. ﬂuctuated between 88 and 91 for a

CHAPTER X‘.—A’ Thrilling Situation
,.;‘ Mrs. Kemp stopped and stared at Dick’s twin
-brother in the utmost amazement. It seemed to
heras if she were looking at the young broker
 whom she had just given her order for 100
shares of M. & 0. stock. Nick, _of course, no-
—.t_iced the astonished look shefavored "him ,with«,
‘and as ‘he had. never seen her before, heguessed
:she had takennhim for his brother Dick: Mrs.
 Kemp  taken him for Dick, for she knew it
‘ wasiiinpossible for a person to be in. two places
Latthe same time. She had just left Dick at his
~‘ desk, and what amazed her was to, meet his living
mage outside in the corridor. She had, forgotten
that Dick had told her he had a twin brother.

At that moment, Billy came out with an en» 
velope in his hand. He was bound for Gaylor’s'
office with an order to that broker to purchase
the hundred shares of M. & 0:‘ for Mrs. Kemp._ 
I-Ie rushed to the elevator, and the lady followed,

“All,right,’-’ replied Nick, “IL’ll'

“Send your statement to my office," and I'll;

Nick an Fanning Went out tégether

over to Einstein & Blumberg’s office. He was 
shown into. Einsteinfs room, and stated his busi-  ’
ness. S '= ,_. ' . ,. _ p ' '

“I wonder if there are any orders in these?”
‘he muttered, as he carried them into the private
room to examine. . ,
Only one’ of them contained an order, accom-
panied by a draft on the Manhattan National
“Bank. The order was for 500 shares of D. & G.
at the market, and the draft ca~1le.d,.~for the mar-
, ginal deposit of $5,000. '
“That is something like it," said Nick to him-
self. “It's worth a dozen small orders such as
we've been receiving of late’, though ofpcourse,

 everything counts. Our new customer ».,is John
 Pollak, hotel keeper, proprietor of the Pollak

 House,’ Carthage, Blank County, New York. He

must have money. Well, we’ll tr to take care
of Mr. Po1lak., Maybe we’ll be a le to do busi-
ness with him right along. He seems to be an
easy-going kind of man, judging by his letter.”
, Nick wrote a note to Gaylor telling him to
buy the, 500 shares for Pollak’s account, and
' enclosing the draft which he indorsedin favor
of the broker.‘ He called Billy, and sent him
over‘ with the note to Exchange Place. Th n he
handed the order to Elsie to enter, dictate ‘ an-
, swers to some of the letters, and to‘the other
correspondents directed her to send market let-
ters for two Weeks.‘ He then called on Fanning
—  to notify him that he had filled his order for.the
; , 20,000 shares of B. & O. Fanning was engaged,
so he waited in the reception-room. As there
1 were no customers in the room at the time, he
had the indicator all to himself, and looking over
.the7t§.‘pe he saw that M. & 0. had advanced to
64 — . V ‘

 ,“That puts us nearly $50,000 ahead on the
deal,”« he said to himself. “No place like Wall
Street for making money, if ‘luck runs with you.”

Finally, Fanning’s visitor departed, and Nick

‘ went in to see him. He had hardly opened his
mouth to tell the, broker that he had filled his
order when a stout, red-faced man rushed in, in
Va state of great excitement. Utterly ignoring

 the presence of Nick, he strode up to Fanning

.1 and shaking his fist in the trader's face, roared

 ‘EASTMAN &  srocxs AND ‘BONDS

evening papers had quite a sensational account
of the attempt made by Broker Sweet to shoot
Broker Fanning, in the latter’s office, and how
the latter’s life was saved through the prompt
interference of Nick Eastman, one of the twin
boy brokers of Wall Street. The morning papers

'~ had afew additional particulars, and also stated
that Sweet ‘had developed a certain form of in-
sanity which would necessitate his .removal to an
asylum or a sanitarium. Fanning told his
friends and ac uairitances in Wall Street that
Nick Eastman lliad undoubtedly saved his life,
and» his statement made the boy broker quite
popular among the younger set on the Street.

;usual1y vinegary aspect was somewhat softened,

as’ if she had forgotten her habitual grouch.

_ ufair.‘ ' She ad, as was her custom, read the
‘Wall Street news in her morning paper while
eating her breakfast in the diniiig-room of the
boardin -house on West Twenty-sixth Street over
which she presided ‘as proprietor, and from what
‘ thefinancial editor said about the prospects of
M. & 0., she was satisfied that the young broker-
“agetitirm to which she had intrusted her $1,000,
had put her on to a good thing in recommending
‘that stock to her attention. The daily market
report_also showed her that M. & 0. had closed

She was not usually received so courteously at

now‘ up 67. The brokers were, trying to» buy all

 they could get of ‘it, but as'the holders of the
‘stock were of the opinion it would go much

higher, it.was quite scarce. Inside of an hour,
while Nick looked on, it went to 70. Then Nick
went “around to Gaylor’s office, and remained
therevfor another hour. Gaylor had bought, and

 was holding the 10,000 shares for the firm.- He

“No, Billy. If you want to come out aheadgqm

suppose you’ll escort Miss Elsie to the station i

. “Probably,” replied Nick, with a flush. ” _
Dick went ayay, and then’ Nick asked the girl
if she was ready to go home. She said she was,
and in a few minutes they left the office togeth-
. er. There was no‘ doubt that Nick was very
=ir:.uch interested in Miss Adams. She was un-
v “iioubtedly "a lovely girl both in looks and disposi-
tion, _and the more h saw of her the stronger he
became attached to er. It was also evident
that she» liked him very much, too, and’ was
‘pleased with the attention he gave her. He
walked with her to the station nearly every after-
noon, and showed his partiality for her society
‘in different ways that she couldn't help noticing.
Dick-soon saw it was a case of “spoons” with
both, and he chuckled over_ it in a quiet way, for
‘he had no objection to Elsie as his future sister-
in’-law, if things turned out that way.
."At nine o’clock next morning, Billy was in his
 chair at the office as usual. He felt like a small
I » capitalist, for according .,to his figuring, he had
: made about $120 on his deal, which made him
worth over $200. That was a small fortune to
.  . He intended to ive his hard-working moth-
ﬁer $50 of that, and uy himself a new suit of
-clothes as well as other things he needed. The

T giearance of Elsie Grant who came in at half-

together, as she seldom had anything to employ

--the mail. Billy was telling the stenographer
"bout his successful deal in M. & 0., when the

‘cidedly worried and anxious. ’

“ “The bosses haven't come down yet, ma’ani,”

“In fifteen or twenty minutes,” replied the
hoy,.careless1y. “Take a seat, iiia’am, and make

The visitor sat down for a minute, but she was
solill at ease that she bounced up and began
pacing the oﬂice up and down. ,  1
“Get on to our new customer. She’s ti-ainin

CHAPTER —xiIi.—A Chapteriof Trouble for: K
- Billy. - = /r

A few days after the excitement connected with
the slump of M. & 0’. had died away, Eastman &
Co. received a letter from their Cartilage cus-
orming
them"that he was coming to New York and would
call attheir oﬂice.
had gone down several points, after a previous
rise, but his margin was "still suﬂicient to keep his
dealabove the danger line. The twin brokers ex-
pected to see the stock‘advance again as soon as
the market picked up once more, for it was a
gilt-edge one and was worth wore. than its present
low price. '

In fact, the boys thought so ‘well of it that they '

bought 10,000 shares of it, expecting to realize
anywhere from $50,000 to $75,000 out ogit in«a.
short time. Theypaid 85 for it. Two days later,
around noon time, when both the young‘ brokers

happened to be in the oﬁice ,to’gethe_r, the door . »

opened and ii stout,man who weighed over two
hundred pounds, came.in.

“Is Ml‘. Eastman in?” asked the visitor. «
“Yes, sir. Both of ’em is in.” ‘~ .
“Both of them.” What do you mean?”

“Both the’ partners. What’s',your name? I'll

take it to ’em.” -

» Billy to the stout visitor.



‘Instead of telling Billy, toshow. him in the boys
thought they’d pay their important ‘country c_us-
tomer the honor of going out and greeting him.

At that moment the ‘door opened again, and ad-A

mitted two girls who called4to_ see Elsie.‘ _
“Mr. Eastman will see‘ you 12.8% inoi_nen:c1,” Sgllld
ep insi e e
railin’.” I '
. Mr. Pollak waddled inside. _ '
At that moment the young brokers left their

.desks together to meet Mr. Pollak. They forgot

what eﬁect their‘ remarkable likeness was almost
certainto have on a stranger. Their only thought
was to greet Mr. Pollak'in their most courteous
manner. As the curtains parted and Nick and
Dick advanced with outstretched hands to ,w.el-
come their visitor, the stout gentleman started

L ,, back with an ejaculation of astonishment and

tripped over Billy Brown who, with malicious in-
tent, had slipped down behind him. Bi_1ly’s idea
was to startle the fat man by seizing his ankles,

’ r and growing like a dog. This plan he carried out,

,‘ but his efforts were wasted“ The hotel keeper's

amazement ‘on seeing two young men looking ex-

j actly alike coming, toward him, did more to stag-

ger him than anything else could have done. The
hold Billy ad on his ‘ankles caused him to lose
his balance, and down hewent backward. .

' ,,-Unfortunately for.the oﬁice boy, Mr. Pol»lak’s

two hundi-ed—odd avoirdupois landed squarely on

. ~.-his.‘ back, and the shock-was.so great that Billy
' - thought the ceilingdiad tumbled in and buried ‘him

under ,it. Thus the joke was turned against Billy

- v. himself, and he didn’t appreciate that fact for a
"‘.,.,c‘ent.' At any rate, his body had acted as a buf- _

‘fer,‘and broke the stout~man’s fall. While he lay

' there a» picture of discbmﬁted surprise, Nick and .

Dick sprang forward, and each seizing their vis-

’ ' itor by one of his arms, liyftedihim up and led

.planations soon made matters all right.
» Billy, he picked himself up feeling like a wreck,

him half;dazed into their private room, where ex-
As for

and wondering if, an ambulance would have to be
summoned to take him to_a hospital. Elsie and
the two girls who had called to see her, found
his predicament exceedingly amusing, but Billy
was willing to swear that he didn’t see anything
funi‘;ar'about"it. i ' . ,
“ hat were you trying to do, Billy?” asked the
stenographer merrily.’ 
?‘Nothin',” growled the office boy,‘ as he retired
to his seat, with the impression that a practical

- joke sometimes acts like a boomerang.

Elsiqasked her friends inside the railing, and
there was a lot of suppressed laughter between
them over Bi1ly’s mishap. Billyknew they were
laughing at him and it made him mad. It was
badenough to be crushed almost ﬂat under a

when that crazy Sweet drew his clerringer on me,
and there isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for Nick,
. or his brother either, for that matter.” _
Nick added a couple of lines to the _firm’s
standing advertisements calling the attention of
' ladies interested in Wall Street matters to the
~ special facilities offered by their office for the
transaction of business connected with the mar-
ket. 'The boy brokers now found it necessary to
employ a regular bookkeeper, as [Elsie had enough
work in her regular department to keep her going
\all the time. Their mail orders and general cor-
respondence had increased to such an extent that
it took up a good part of Dick’s time to look af-
ter this branch, while Nick devoted himself.to
the city customers. ,,

CHAPTER XV.—Conclusion. '

. It was about this time that Dick Eastman
made the acquaintance of a very . pretty girl
named Edith Cushman, at a receptionvto which he
and his brother were invited. She was the daugh-

‘ ter of the secretary of the Eastern Coaland Iron

Corporation, and it was a case of love at ﬁrst .

sight with them; Dick asked permission to call
on'h'er~iat lierhome and being accorded that privi-
lege, soon became a regular visitor. Reports had
latel been appearing in the ﬁnancial papers that
' the astern Coal and Iron Corporation was ne-
gotiating for the control of the S. & P. Short
me Railroad kCompany which connected their
section of the coal region with Scranton. Owing
,to mismanagement andone thing or another, the
stock of the S. & P. had depreciated in the mar-
ket, and was looked at askance by the big oper-
ators. While it was known that the coal ‘and
'iron company had madeovertures looking to the
consummation of a deal, it was also known that
the people in controlof the road did not look with
favor on, a transfer of their interests. ‘ Wall
Street, therefore, did not put much faith in the

‘ latest rumors to‘the eﬁect that an arrangement

satisfactory to both sides had been reached. One
evening when Dick called on his girl he asked
. her in an offhand way if she had heard her fa-

. . ther say anything about the deal between the com-

panies.

“Why, yes,” she replied, “father told mother
last night that his company had practi'ca1ly ac-
'quired the control of the railroad. He said the
papers were now being drawn up and would be
signed the first of next week. He also told moth-

‘ er that he had bought quite a" block of the rail-

road stock at a price that would yield him a

handsome proﬁt when the deal was ﬁnally an»

nounced to the public.”

Dick told Nick next morning what he had
learned-from Edith Cushman about the deal be-
tween the coal and ironcorporation, and the S.
.& P.’ Railroad Company. I i

“S. & P. 's,going at 42,” he said. “It is sure to
iump above 50, and may go to 60 when the deal
is known to!be an assured fact. We can’t afford
to let,such a chance get away, from us.” -

“Well,”, said Nick, “as our capital is all tied
-up, we’~ll'-';ha've to “raise the coin. on the securities‘

raise $150,000.¢ any rate right away,

or us.’ I "V
Nick carried a boxful of stock certiﬁcates to the I
Manhattan National Bank, and raised the sum"
he wanted on the larger part of them. Then he-.
called on Gaylor and gave him the order. Mrs:
Kemp was in the private office talking to Nick I
when Gaylor’s messenger Brought him a note in-
forming him that the stock had been bought,
and was held by the broker subject to Eastman
& Co’s order. The boarding missus had just drop- ’
ped $1,000 in an unlucky deal, and she was feel-,;
ing glum. J ;
“I wish you’d put me on to something goodlthat ,
would» get me back‘ that money," she said to Nick.
“Well, you might give me an order to buy you"
some S. & P.” he answered. “I have an idea it '
will boom inside of two weeks?" - ‘ ' ’
Mrs. Kemp had so much confidence in his judg-
ment that she said she would buy 300 shares of it, '
Next morning Mrs. Kemp, who was recognized b" "
the other lady customers as a sort of favored [1
person in the ofiice, told a bunch of fair ‘specu-,
labors that they couldn’t do‘ better than buy S.»
& -P. if they wan d to get in on agood thing‘.
The result was, at Nick was surprised bye} ‘
small avalanche of orders for S. & P. stock, from ’ .
ten shares up to 100. Nick carried the buiichbf ,0
orders to Fanning, explaining that the ﬁrm 
short of ready cash temporarily, and therefore ~
couldn’t carry any more stock than they alreatlyi 
had. He didnft, hint that the firm was in, on a -
private speculation of its own, which was~tl‘i‘e~reeI-3'“
reason why money was tight with them.’ 0 , 3 , V

“I suppose so,” replied Nick. 5 g 
Fannin said he would fill the orders right;

found the, floor in a fever of excitement over 

S. & P. He remembered that it looked that way
before the slump in M. &, 0.

“I guess I’ll sell out now, and be on the safe _

Accordingly on his way back, he dropped in‘ at

he had made nearly $250. Nick. called’ Mrs.

and said: . v‘ » '_ 

“Well, I'm stumped if it isn’t Mr. Clif! Found)

“I declare for it. if this ain't what you mi

around. I guess the storm kep’ him from .keepin'
too close to the island. and I don’t believe we'}
see him again.” . I . ,' , " 

Clif said nothing, for his disappointment, wa
too deep forwords, and the"/captain continued’

“Well, ,I thought I’d come out and see what,,had
happened to my cock and steward, and as.there’x
a regular path through the woods and ovei’_"the*;

‘ “I.don’t see any help for it, captain.” said‘ G1 ,

, The tide was still high enough to_ ﬂoat the boat,
and, taking the cook and steward with him, Haz-
eltine left the shore, while Clif and the others
‘went’ by the path'to the other side of the island,
_hich.they reached in about half an hour‘.
in half an hour Hazeltine arrived. ,
Then the boats were taken up, the anchor. was
raised, the sails were unfurled and set, and in a
«‘ channel leadingyto the sea. ,
The captain sent Clif ‘to the wheel, and stood
alongside to give him directions. .
" Clif saw that the passage out was not as dan-
‘ gerous as that in to the island, although it had
been hazardous enough in, a little boat and at
‘ night. ~ I

,was relieved, and the ‘-course was set so as to
leave the island several miles distant on their
sjzarboard beam. _

_ .‘“That means we are going to the southeast,”
saidﬂlif to Dolf. at the galley ,door._ ‘.‘,YVheI‘e
are we bound, Dolf? To the West Indies?

: :By noon the island _was out of sight, but there
' was land to be seen dimly o_n the_western horizon,
but this, too, faded from sight in another hour,
, yndjshey were on the open sea. ‘

’ §'I‘he boys were in the starboard watch, and on
hat day had the afternoon on deck, which would
give them the midwatch from twelve at night to
ouryiii the mornins£- _ ,.

. .- There was not much to bedone during the aft-
>ernoo'nI, and Clif had many opportunities to walk
L on deck with Ada ‘and discuss their, plans.

‘ “Irthought he might put you ashore,_’f said Clif,
‘»but.it looks now as_if he would take you to the
. West Indies, where he seems to be bound.

INSULIN FROM ACORNS
I_nsulin from acomis is now an accomplished
fact," according to reports from Germany. «It will

~ vegetable insulinwill be concentrated in tablet
form, and will be, it is expected, cheaper ‘than

not know, but going to the room where. her _

— “Yes,” s e said in answer to my question. “His

watch is gone, also his diamond studs and a pair

thing I had to work on. Had the bonds (be ,-_ .

‘I made a tour of the pawn—shops. in search of

one night, engrossed’ in thinking o the-rcomm‘-’ r ="
drum which I was trying _to solve‘,-when chanting
to cast my eyes towards the interior of a"pawn?4‘
broker's sales—store, Lcaught ‘the brilliant flash
of an‘ immense ruby. Expecting disappointment,
and yet unwilling to let ‘anything pass, no ‘matter
how trivial, I opened the door and entered. A man , ~
with a full brown beard stood at the counter, and  r
the proprietor ‘was oﬂ'erin him an amount of ‘
money for something whic he did not care to
accept. < '

“Well,” he grumbled ﬁnally, casting an un-
easy glance at me, “well, let me have it.” I saw
him so place his, body as to prevent my seeing
the article, whatever it was, as he placed it in
the other’s hand. Taking the money, he turned-
to go. The suddeness of the movement attracted
the proprietor-’s attention, and in turning he_ un-
consciously gave me a glimpse of a pair of ruby
cuif-buttons, surrounded by diamond sparks. The
brown-bearded man was near the door. There
was no time for words, soul‘ took several-pro-i
dig'iou_s leaps and grasped his, shoulder. So quickly
that-I thought I was by a ﬂash of lightning, the

I My face -was made up as to-‘seem lined with
