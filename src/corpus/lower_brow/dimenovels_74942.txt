Jack, and he hurried into his clothes. ‘ ‘~,;'
Before he was through dressing another knock

“All right,” answered’ Jack. . ,;

To say the truth; he was in a hurry himself to i
get as far away from Seaport as he could before(
his escape was discovered and pursuit started. '
He was afraid, however, that he stood ~litt1

CHAPTER XI.——Jack Makes an Important" ; ’

Discovery.

. Jack went to his room, which was directly over

the 'kitchen,_ and overlooked the yard, and pre'- ‘
pared to retire for the night, for he was tired and ‘

downhearted. He pushed the lower sash of his,’
window‘ well up, for ,it was a warm night, and

took "a survey of the yard. While he stood there,

looking out, three ﬁgures approached. the big farm.

wagon, which Jack supposed was loaded with ;

sand. One of them carried a lantern. It was

not so dark _anyway but Jack was able‘ to identify"
them as Smith and his two bearded friends. They”
went to the back ofcthe wagon, and while Smith;
I held the lantern, the other men undid the end or

the covering and ’threw it back. One of ‘them

mounted the wagon and began to dig into the sand

with his hands, pushing it aside. , '
“I wonder what they're .up to?” Jack’ aske

The ‘boy watched the man’s actions with much _ I

interest. Finally he seemed to have got a.*g7ri "
on something and began to tug‘ away. Smith

,held up the lantern, and the light enabled" the‘
watcher to see that the man was lifting something."

heavy out of the sand.

Assoon as the thing was clear, Jack saw that-'

it was a tub, ﬂat and bulky, exactly likethe tubs‘
he had seen two nights since in the kitchen 0

Rickards’ house on the ‘cliff road. The man"
pushed thetub over the ‘end of the wagon, where}
it was caught by Smith and the other bearded‘
individual and lowered to the ground. .Tlie,fel-
‘low in the wagon carefully ﬁlled up. the hole

from which the tub had been taken, and smoothed
_ evenly all over, after which he
jumped down. ~ T ‘

" The cover was then replaced and retied. Smith ’
blew out the light and walked over to a small.‘

outhouse, leaving his icornpanions standing bmh

"tub. Opening the door of the outliouse, he pulled
out a whe‘el—bai~1’ow and trundle/d ‘it over the‘
wagon. The tub was lifted on it, and then Sl'.¥1.l‘l;_h’/'

wheeled it over near the kitchen door, Wherefhe
left it standing with the lantern on top of it.; S‘
He and his friends then strolled oi? around,‘

The paragraph then went ‘on to give a brief ‘ 
statement ‘of the alleged encounter of Caleb"

named Jack Greely, with three men in the - ..
caverns. These-men were supposed to be Rick-
ards, Noakes and Watling, who divided their
time between a small farm on the cliff road and 
the fishing industry. They had latel come under .’i_
suspicion as the presumed link‘ etween the ~. ~‘
smugglers and their suspected agent, but nothing . 
had been ‘found to criminate them. The story 
related to the inspector by Caleb Stone, however, 
had induced that officer to secure a warrant for: 
the ‘arrest, of the men, and the boy trader had‘ '
been locked up to make sure of’ his appearance
as a witness when wanted. That was all. There _

three men in question. By the time the boyhad,

to take charge of both the priso‘ners and, the

As it was wellyknown that this would be the

‘last "corn-husking of the season, a great crowd

of young peo.p1e assembled at the Jones’ farm
The farm was a very large one, and it was known

that the farmer had raised an immense cropof
corn, and that the feast, as in times past, would .

be bound to be a great one. -
Mr. Jones had killed several hogs which were

to be barbecued in the old Virginia style. Several .
large hams were to be boiled and sliced, and any

amount of fancy cakes would be on hand. Lem-
onade was to be the limit of the drinks, except
and coffee, and neighbors of the Joneses vol
teered to superintend the feast. =

Of course Jimmy and George were both present,

- andthey passed each other several times during

the evening, their\‘sl_1oulders actually. touchin
Both Sally anddimmy were dressed in th

Eretty girl, Jimmy was very

Many young men were like him in that respect.
George,.with some of his friends, kept drinking
from 9. bottle, and soon George was in a humor
for any kind of excitement. Finally. news came
to Jimmy that George was fast ﬁlling himself full
of whisky, and threatening to go after Jimmy and
smash him. ’  \
“Oh, I,guess he won’t do that,” said Jimmy.’ .
“Yes, heowill,” said his friend. 
“Well,” put in Sally, “you and some of

CHAPTER XII
Trouble at Another Husking‘

Everybody present was eager ‘to preventa dis— a

. turbance, and thus avoid breaking up the pleas-
ure of the evening, so they rushed to and fro;
excited women being heard screaming, while the
majority of the men seemed to be under the 1_m-,
__pression that all that was necessary was to seize
. and hold one or the other of the belligerents; so
Jimmy found himself in the hands of half

I a-dozen of the cider farmers present, bare—headed
-‘ and looking around for George.

~ “Say,” he ﬁnally called to some of the men who .

‘were holding him; “be quiet, Jimmy.” : G
' “Say,” he said again, “look .out for George. I
struck him only one blow, and that was after he

 struck me on‘ my head while I was talking with

’ ‘-. Mrs. Hemphill. I never saw him until I saw him
rushing toward me afterward as I ‘was getting
up on my knees; but I thought that he had some-

- thing in his hand, so jumped up as quickly as I
ﬂ could, and gave him by best blow from the shoul-
qder straight in his face, and down he went.’’
Just then some one sung out: ~
» “Here he is, boys; and he looks as though he
has been finished.” '
_ ‘ Several rushed‘ to George and picked him up;
" ‘but he was utterly unconscious. Evidently as he
fell »his head struck a stone, and the violent con-
tact/with it had made him, unconscious. ' ,‘
Men poured glasses of water in his face, shook
him roughly, and called him by‘ name, but he\
‘seemed not to hear or knew anything that was’
said to him. The smell of liquor was very strong
on his breath. Finally Judge Wilson pushed his
way through the crowd, looked George full in_ the
. .face, and saw from the way his head hung that
 he was unconscious, so he took him by the shoul-
der, shoo him violently, and called him by
 name. ‘ ' /“" ‘ ‘
’ I /‘.‘Gentlemen,.” said he, “the boy is badly hurt.

A physician lived near by, and he happened to
V, be on the grounds at the time. -
Some one hunted him up ‘and told him that he
.— was needed, so he hurried to the spot? He knelt
;_ down by the side of the injured boy and saw
that he was bleeding freely. . .
 "“Gentlemen, his head is ‘badly hurt, and I must

from behind him and struck him a violentwblow '
on the head, causing him to fall forward on his‘.
hands and knees. He looked around and .. saw; "
George coming toward him exclaiming that now ,2
they would have it out. Quick as a ﬂash Jimmy’
sprang to his feet, and I don’t know whether‘.he*j”:
had anything in his hands or not, but he met
‘George face to face and struck him a powerfula“
blow full in the face, and you can there see wher_e"7""
his blow landed. He didn’t strike George on theft
head at all.- That wound which is bleeding so‘
‘freely George must have gotten as he fell.” , Q
/ F‘Yes, I saw him where he fell,’f said another '
lady, “and the next instant the men grabbed _.
Jimmy and held him. Only one_ blow apiece?
passed betweenthem.” ' ‘ : - 
“Doctor, that’s right," said Jimmy, who over-.3
heard the testimony of the two ‘ladies. “I didn’t' ‘
know at first who it was who struck me. ,,I "got
. in one good blow on George’s face. It was a hard 
one, and ‘he went over backwards, as though,-a
mule had struck him.” ~ I  ’
— “Well,” said the doctor, “that=explainsgt,he,
whole matter. 'His head came inlcontact,wi,th' a.-’-'
stone as he- fell backwards,,and nowwe will tr "
to ﬁnd out the result of it.” ' I 
There was a young man near who was study-my
ing medicine unde the doctorwho» was exainiiilng,“
George’s head, and he had a good deal to "say
until the doctor ﬁnally told him to .keep,quiet.'i '4
The doctor called for a. pair of scissors, with
which he cut the hair for an inch about the
wound. When he had done so he saidivfhat his 1'
head had come in contact with a rathe; sshar
corner of a rock, and then he and one of the in
«present went out to the spot where; they-. had '.
found George lying, and discovered thefstone; 
which was deeply imbedded in the ground, ‘a'a’d‘
of course, impossible for them to raise. Quite
quantity of gore had ﬂowed from ‘the wound. '
The doctor and his assistant went back into th
house and did all they could to ‘restore the young
man to ‘consciousness.  . ,  :1 »~
