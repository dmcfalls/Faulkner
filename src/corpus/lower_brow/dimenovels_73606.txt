About three weeks after the incident Jerry was.
sent out at half past nine to take a note to 9.11,,
oﬁice on Broadway. . , k ’ J

He reached that thoroughfare at_ the. corner of,
Wall Street just as a ﬁne-looking, well-dressed‘
gentleman alighted from a surface car and started;
for the sidewalk. He didn’t notice a rapidly
driven express wa on coming down the street till- ..
the horses were a ost o‘n,top of the gentleman, 1:
who had failed himself to observe his danger’. It
was too late ‘to warn the man, so Jerry sprang ’
forward to save him if he could. "

One of the horses struck the gentleman a stag- ‘ '
gering blow and sent him reeling into Jerry’s
arms. The young messenger clutched and swung .”
him out of danger just as the team dashed by, and .
thus saved him from being run over by the wheels.-’ ’

Only 9. boy of tremendous strength could have- 5
accomplished the fact, and the passers—by, many
of whom had stopped expecting to witness a.I
tragedy, uttered exclamations of surprise as well
as relief. »

"I reckon that was a narrow escape you had,
suh,” said Jerry, as he supported the dazed gentle- , ‘
man to the side-walk. ’ _

It was some moments before the man could J
collect his faculties; but when he did he realized’
that he probably owed his life to the stalwart '
young messenger; ,’ ‘

“You’ve saved my life, young man,” said the
gentleman, in tremulous tones. " ~

“Wal, I’ll allow you might have been killed err
hadn’t been spry in gettin’ you out of the way of
them hosses,” admitted Jerry. ' . .

“Come away from this crowd. I want to talk. '
to you.”_said the man, gripping Jerry by the arm
and leading him toward the entrance of the corner;
building, He walked rather unsteadily, an
trembled a good deal, so that the boy found‘-it
necessary to lend him the support of his arm. ’ ‘ *

They entered the building and walked to the
elevator.

“I guess you're all rightnow, suh,’ so I’ll get on
my way," said Jerry. _ _ ’ , » , .

“No, no; come up ,_to my office.” 

, Jerry .had- an idea that‘h_e‘oughtn"t to lose any-
more time‘, but still ‘if the gentleman didn’t feel “
able to reach his oﬂice alone he guessed it was

his duty to see him th_er'e. _
The ofﬁcexthey were bound‘ for was on the
second ﬂoor, overlooking Broadway. It was one
of the ‘best suites'in‘the building, and was ex‘-*
pensively furnished. 2 ' .  ‘ 
._The gentleman took Jerry into hisprivate office.‘
The young Southerner opened his eyes at the
richstyle of the furniture and decorations.‘ .11:
made Mr. Ward’s private room look, like thirty
cents. -
,“Sit down,” said the gentleman, starting to re‘-
move his overcoat. , ‘ . . "
"Jerry assisted him just as he was accustomed to
help his boss. _ '
‘Thank you,” -said the gentleman, seating him’-,
self in the nearest chair. The boy hesitated, but
ﬁnally sat down. “I want you to understand that
I*am‘very grateful to you, young man,” said the
broker, for such was his business. I .

.. “vWa1,,I reckon you ain't had no cause to regret

‘-‘No, and I never expect to," he replied, ear’-
nestly. “I am sure she would be glad to meet you

knew was coming. ‘ V
-‘ On the following Tuesday Jerry carried a mes-
sage to a broker in the Mills Building. The
n . trader was engaged when he arrived and he had
, to take a seat and wait. There wereivperhaps a
,- dozen customers in the waiting-room, and many
,of them were gathered around the ticker. Sud-
 denly Jerry noticed that the persons at the ticker
had grown uncommonly interested in the quota-
tions, and he heard them talking about M. & N.
' One remarked that it was going up steadily. An-
- other said it was booming like a house aﬂre. Jer-

‘ he had been expecting it, and considered it a
f foregone conclusion. When he got back to the
moﬂice he found some excitement among the cus-
tomers there. He was immediately sent over to
 the,Exchange with a message to Mr. Ward.

_ ..-While waiting for his employer to come to the
’ railing he saw a crowd of traders around the M.
,~& Nt. statndard, shouting and gesticulating at a
 grea rs. e.

» Glancing at the blackboard he saw the M. &
N. quotations being posted one after another,
_ each time higher than before. _

V. went to the Exchange the stockhad reached 87.

“By gum! I guess I’ve got hold of what Will
calls a tip ” -he said to himself. “I’m jes’ goin’,tQ_)~
buysome I). &. L. and see how it works out.”— .

Nextmorning he brought his $200 dovrntowiii -i
- and-put it upon twenty shares of the~stOck-
‘which was ruling at 85. ' - . ‘

The brokers had said that the combine would ': *0

boost the price to par at any rate, so eri-y de-,
cided that he would sell when‘ it reached that
point. 

When he came to dinner that evening he told; V

the boarders he had another tip for them.
“You want to buy D. & L. right away. You
can get ‘it now‘ at 85. Wal, you don’t want to
hold it after it gets to par. That’s the time ‘to
cash in. Ef you hang on for the last dollar the

fust thing you know you’ll be eatin’ snowballs.” .7
“Eating snowballs!” laughed one of the ladies.’

“What do you mean by that?”
“Wal, '
the money to pay your board,” replied Jerry.
Next day many of tlie boarders visited an-up-"_
town brokerage office and bought D. & L. in
varying amounts up_ to ﬁfty shares.

The dude clerk invested in ten shares, and then
began to ﬁgure out how he should spend his ex-
pected winnings. Jerry gave as much of his at-
tention to his new deal as he could afford to do,
and in about a week noted with satisfaction that
the stock was going up steadily, a little at 5..
time. . - . ' ' -

After getting up to 92 the boom began and*it_
reached par in'a couple of hours, the brokers go-‘
ing wild over it. It got up to 102 before Jerry
found a chance to go to the little bank and order
his shares sold. Half an hour later, after getting
as high as 104, a sudden slump came on and pre-

: cipitated something of a panic in the Exchange;

during which D. & L. fell rapidly to 90, where it.
stopped. ’

When he reached his bdarding-house he found -

the boarders in the parlor discussingthe market.

Some who had gone in on Jerry's advice had sold ‘
. out at par and reaped algood proﬁt, but twodt

three had held on too long, and only stood to win;
a small amount. x

The dude clerk, when he c'ame in, admiltmf

that he had lost most of his anticipated 1)
because he couldn't get away from the store‘
find out how things were going. '
“Well you on htn’t to 1 t th " ‘:1
Jerry. "‘.Ef a fe ler isn’t oipihg ?oIi’ alle.tiie'

.he’d better keep out of the market.”

When’ the bank settled with Jerry the be

found he hd made $350 and that made him worth ‘
nearly $550. ~ ’

“By gum! I’m gettin’ along. I’ve made nearly;
$500 off my two deals. I kin buy ﬁfty shares of
stocknow, and make money faster,” he Said as
himself. A » ’ "

That afternoon he received a letter from ‘Mist’
A_my Bent. She said she had been -lookin ’ '
him to call for some little time and felt i
pointed because he had not done so. She closed’
her note by saying that she would be pleased to

it convenient to call. I - _ «, - .

Jerry, in his inexperience, didn’t know that the Ev L -
slump of A. & F. was a part of the plans of the F‘ "
syndicate to shakeout the stock on the market
so its brokers could buy it in as low as possible. 5
It was natural for timid holders, especially those" '23-. :_
holding shares on margin, to sell when they saw .--.
the price going down, and it was this stock-the 
syndicate was after. Fortunately for Jerry’s  I
peace of mind and pocketbook, A. & F. didn’t go
any lower-than 85. ’

would be breaking his word to Broker O'Donnell.» 5‘

the stock belonged to his employer and he wanted’. ’
to tell him to hold on to it for a rise that he was ' , .

had formed a syndicate to corner P. & Q. shay’
and boom the stock as soon asthey got controlof
Wall Street knowledge and the methods of the
Street. He had been working for Mr. Ward now
nearly ﬁve months, -and there wasn’t a: smarter
messenger in’ the district. Contact with New
Yorkers, and especially the gentle inﬂuence»
Amy Bent, had, rubbed down his ‘rough ways a
great deal, and he wasn't as loud as he was wh ‘
he first made his appearance in the city. Heisti
wore his soft cowboy hat, for nothing would ins
duce him to purchases derby, even for Sunday
wear, while his language was not greatly imi-,
proved. Having satisﬁed himself that ,P. &‘Q;
was a good thing to get in on he lost no timein’
buying 100 shares at the little bank. He got it‘
low—water mark—'78. In aweek the rice be ,
going up at a rate that surprised the treet. , the
greatest excitement centered around it that Wall.
Street had known that year. . The syndicate had a,
raft of money to call upon, and as a consequenc"
the bears attacked the rise in vain. Jerry ha
never before seen so many customers in the office
as were there now. They crowded the waitif '
room from ten to three, and when he was i,n'i;ll§e’
office he had no place to sit down-. That didn’t
bother him, for he was scarcely in ﬁve minutesatj
a time. _ , 
“By in! This is a boom for fair an’ no mi

On the very next day Jerry heard .some brokers _

talking about the rumor of,a consolidation of, t
M. & P. with jcrie D. & G. road. These were t’
western railroads, the latter being a big tru
line, the‘_stock of which was regarded as gi
edge, while the former was an independent line

which ,hadn’t cut a great ﬁgure in Wall Street .\ ~

for a long‘ time. It was ruling as low as 45, and ;
the woods were full of it going a—begging.  —,
“It will be a great l.l‘l.lJ'l2‘. for the"stockholders“
of M. & P. if the arrangement goes through,” said.
one of the brokers;
nothing in it.” . . E .
“You can't tell,”. replied one of the others. “I? V
heard that the"‘D. & G. system has been trying tj

annexthat road’ for a long time, and,the on

through," laughed a third broker. 2 “Everybody
'W'D;11ld,g0'f0r M: & P. It would sell like hot cakes

i attwenty points above its present price.”

""_“I_t'-cer_tainly would,” said the ﬁrst broker, “but
‘ I’m, afraid..you’ll never see it.”
V “Stranger things than that happen in Wall

“§Street," said Broker No. Two.

“I’1l allow they do,” admitted the ﬁrst trader.
,. Then they walked away and Jerry .heard no

r m.0re._ He was greatly interested, however, in the

prospect of the rumored consolidation, and next

~morning he told Mr. Ward what he had heard

the brokers say on the subject, and asked him
«what he thought about it. ‘
:7 ‘"1 ‘don’t think there is anything in it, Jerry,
hut‘I’m just as much obliged to you for telling

"fine," thinking Jerry had told him for his own

'nte~rest.. “You’ll hear’ all kinds'- of rumors if you
isten to what the brokers say when you're around
‘among them, but you mustn’t place .any depend-
ence on their conversation. If it was anything

Lreallyi-mportant they wouldn’t discuss it in
* public.” « .
‘ ~ So Jerry returned to his seat with the idea

;that what he had heard didn’t amount to a whole

, «lot:

‘Next day he called at a big broker’s office with
a message and -was showninto his private room.

‘ "“‘Wait a’ mi-nute,” said the gentleman after

reading the note.
 Herang his bell but there was no response.
Then hestepped outside and called to his cashier.
"_W_;l,iile he was out Jerry glanced carelessly at his
"desk, and ri ht under his nose was a letter writ-
hand on an illuminated letter head
‘that attracted the boy's attention. While ad-
miring the lithograph he unconsciously read the
“few‘lines of the note. This is what he saw:

1 ‘ “DEAR Di—iLANcI«:Y.—'-The consolidation of the

‘ .. “JOHN G. SPINK.”

‘fBy gum!” ejaculated Jerry. «“So the consoli-
dation has gone through. Er I don’t make a haul
cut of this tip I’m a ring-tail-ed catamount.” _
 Then Mr. Delanpey returned and handed him
a’package to take back to Mr. Ward. That after-
noon when he left the oﬂice he went to his safe
deposit box and took out every cent he had there.

. “I’m goin’ the whole hog on M. & P. _Make _or

He went to the little bank and told the clerk
ttrbuy ,him 1,400 shares of the stock, planking
down his money with the air of a dyed-in-the—w9o1

Jerry did look out, and during the next four

;itof~the_ market again. About the middle of Sep~
ember Jerry found out that a combine had been-
ernied to manipulate O.~& H., which was ruling
then at 90. He bought 5,000 shares right away
then awaited results. In ten days the price
‘boomed up to 110. Jerry, however, sold at 105

Jerry called on Amy, and told her that he_ had
gone in heavy on Northern Traction, explaining
‘that a syndicate had been formed to boom it.
Next morning she told her father what Jerry
had said about the syndicate and its plans con-
cerning the stock he had just bought. She did
not say, however, that Jerry had bought any of
V -+ it, for he had made her promise to keep _his
' inarket transactions secret when he first conﬁded
 7 them to her. _ _
' Mr. Bent was naturally interested in what his

. daughter told him, and with the View of learning -

how Jerry found out‘ that a syndicate, had been
. formed to corner the stock he sent a _note around
 j to Mr. Ward’s during the day requesting Jerry to
call on him as soon as he got off that afternoon.
' Wondering what Mr. Bent" wanted, the young
V Texan called on him about half_past ‘three, and
 ; was shown into  private oﬂice.

Mr. Bent agreed to do that, and Jerry «
him an order on the little bank giving him
thority to order the shares sold whenev
thought the time was ripe. 1 5 . 

The syndicate, ignorant of the fact that ‘th’ 7
were 30,000 shares of Northern Traction ready

the price to 115. ‘  ‘ 1' .

Then Mr. Bent offered his stock in four lwts ,
5,000 shares each to the syndicate’s chief bf’ A ‘

They were taken in, but the syndicate stagge
under the load. ’ '

The broker saw he had the combine in a,
and he immediately sent ‘around to the little,
and ordered J'er1"y’s shares to be thrown “on

.“Well, tell me who it is. I’d like to [buy it. I’llf" I
V give him ﬁve dollars a share for it.”

Bob gasped and went on polishing the man's
shoes with an energy he never displayed before.

He calculated that if the fellow meant what he
said he was in $2,000. '

He learned from the broker thatthe par value ’

of the shares was $10. ‘
When he ﬁnished the shine he started 01?, and
the man said to ln‘m: ' «
“Say, where can I find that man who has Round

Hillmming shares ?”
“He is down on Wall Street somewhere, sir,"
“Well, if you'll take me to him I’ll give you a
commission on the trade if he sells.” . .
“All right, sir. I’ll ask him if he will sell. If
you’ll pay ﬁve dollars I
something olf of him." .
“All right. I’ll pay ﬁve dollars a share and take
all you can bring me.” _ 
' Bob strolled oﬂ’ down into Wall Street, hum
ming a tune to himself. ~ j
“Two thousand dollars!” he muttered. “And I’m
only a little bootblack at that. If it is worth $5

a share to him, it is worth more to me, and as It

didn’t get ’em on a margin I ain't obliged to sell
’em. I <lon’t call myself a very smart boy, but

hanged if I ain't lucky! And it isn't a hoodoo,

either."

Such was the good news about the new lead in  

the Round Hill mine that the shares of» the stock
went bounding up like a kangaroo, and before the
day ended they had reached par. »

Everywhere brokers dealing in mining ‘shares 
/were eagerly inquiring after the stock. a ~

There was a ‘good deal of it on themarket.

Thousand of shares had been sold in New York _

the year before at from six to eight dollars a

share, when the news came that the lead had

failed, and the rice dropped down "to a dollar a
share, and even ess.

Some brokers had the shares stored away in

their safes, without any hope of their b 'ng worth.
any more than so much blank paper. QNow they
were taken out, and a tremendous speculation in
them ensued in the mining exchange. The demand

'for them at the Stock Exchange and on the Street

was great.
The next day $15 a share was being offered for

them, and still Bob was carrying his around in his 7.

pocket, «

He again"went into the little Nassau street
bank and offered the shares to the margin clerk
saying: i
shares. Will you lock ’em up for me?”
The clerk looked at them and said:

‘ “Say, Whiddon, where’d -you pick up that tip on’,

this stock ?" .
“I hoodooed a fellow, sir,” he replied. V
“Well, let me tell you, you struck

terday. But this bank doesn’ ’buyvm.i_nin” stock

the vicinity of the mining exchange, where he
. heard brokers‘ discussing Round Hill shares.

Zge heard one predict that it would ‘go up to

“it'll go to $30," remarked the other. "1 will‘

give you $20 for all I can get hold of now.”
.‘ . “I’ll give $20,” said another. “But everybody

who has any of it seems inclined to hold onto it”,

Still he kept on shining shoes.

He was not compelled to sell, /but’ three days"

' later, when $30 a share was offered for it, he
7 began thinking about disposing of his 800 shares.
‘ Yet he couldn’t quite make up his mind to part
with it, but when he found it standing three days
longer at that price he thought it had reached
its limit; so when he heard one of them offering
$30 a sharewliile he was polishing his shoes, Bob
looked up at him and said: '

‘"1 know whereyou can get 800 shares.”

"All right. Where?” ’ -

“Well, how about mycommissioii?”

“Oh, you are in the broker’s business?”

“No, sir; I’m nothing but a shiner, but I’m not
giving away tips for nothing.”

“All right. You take me to the man who has
800 shares, and if he’ll let me have them at $30
I'll give you $100.”

“All right, sir. You come with me,” and he led
him down to the little Nassau street bank, went
up to the window and said:

“This ntleman wants to buy 800 shares of
Round Hil mining stock.” _ _

“All vryight. What’s the matter with selling them
to him. '

" “Iwill. That’s what I brought him here for. My
-commission is $100.”

The clerk produced the shares, and the gentle-

- man said, after examining them, thathe would go

' ,’ down to his bank, get his check certiﬁed, and soon

, the trade was made. Bob’s proﬁt was $24,000, be-

; , sides his original capital of $400 and his commis-
.~ ~ sion. ‘

“Look here, Whiddon,” said the clerk, when the

purchaser went out, “it seems you are making the . .

 hoodoo business pay.” _
2 "Yes,” said he coolly. “You will ‘keep that
money here for me?”

' ‘*(,),f course we will.

 

A" . ' Bob went out feeling like a millionaire, and at

once began debating with himself ‘ whether he‘
should not throw his shoe—box away, get a fine‘
‘suit of clothes and pose as a Wall. Street broker.-

He muttered to himself:

; ,  . 1: it  Stonny Night. 

 

of-town suburb of Philadelphia I paid a visit to
.the, former place in search of a hotel burglar
Whom I had followed from New York City.
"Mose Randall was the man’s real name, but he
was also known by several aliases in different
cities. _ .
“Feeling that I was on the trackof my man, I
- resolved to put up at the tavern for the night and
’ sally out in ‘the morning in search of him.
~ The I-rascal had just robbed a jewelry store on
Broadway, and he had shot the proprietor, who
had interrupted him in his work. ' '
The wounded man lived long enoughto give us
jfair description ‘of his murderer, who wore a red
ﬂannel shirt and .a slouched hat,‘ and who spoke
in very squeaking tones. - ~
,,..As it was announced. in the papers that the
jeweler was found dead in his store, the murderer
was not aware that the detectives had -a descrip-
tion of him. 3‘ . , .
_jWhile sitting in the barrooin, listening to the
‘ildstorin without, the cry “Fire! Fire!” burst on
’my ears. - ' _
-Twomen in the room, who were members of a
. .;local ﬁre company, instantly rushed out in the
storm. ‘
»_ . Being a ﬁreman myself at the time,-the magic
rlords aroused me to action, and out -I rushed with

'~_“I-Iere comes the engine. Rattle her along lively,
ﬁellowsl” " _-

 I seized the rope of the ﬁre-engine with the
_ men,’ and we were soon. rattling along toward the
. ‘fire with some dozen others. ~

      

from the tavern cried: _ .

‘ ‘‘I »knew it was the strange‘ widow's house. and
we can’t save a timber of it, fellerslf’ .

‘ Yet the ﬁremen set about the work, while one
of..ithem cried out: I A I ,1 . '

HOW FINLAND FIGHTS FIRE

' . Strict construction regulations have minimized
the"~'ﬁ‘re menace in‘ Finland, according; to‘ a "recent
issue of Public Safety,‘ oﬂicial organ o_f_ the_ Na-
tional Safety Council, 'In a country where a great

7 deal of timber 'is=used;'in ‘the, construction of‘ a
, majority of the buildings there has been no great
conﬂagration in half a.‘ century. Even ﬁres that
spread to’-neighboring -houses are "very rare; the
last. ﬁre ofthis type took "place about ten ‘years
ago, when four houses were destroyed. 7 ’ '
» No wooden roofs ‘are allowed, and wooden build-
ings are limited-‘to one story in the smaller towns
and toptwo in‘ the larger. " A space of eighteen
 feet‘ is required -‘between ‘wooden’ st.ructures,‘and
 windows are not allowed to face a; neighboring
 house. It is necessary that theﬂoors,',stairs_and

T staircases of stone ‘structures "be made ﬁreproof.
In1.addition‘to’ these and other such regulations,

WORKMEN OF BELGIUM ARE NOW
‘ PROSPERING

The comparatively prosperous condition of the
’_ workinglpeople of_ Belgium, despite temporary
, hardships due to stabilization of the currency last
‘ear, is pictured in a speech delivered by, M.
fauters, the Socialist Minister of Labor, at the
‘recent nationalyconvention of the Belgian Miners’

Union. 0 ‘ T
“For the sake of stabilizing Belgian currency
we/have made great sacriﬁces,” said M. Wau ere,‘

 
  

' "but we shall not regret them. The evil e ects.

of, stabilization are, thus far, not so great as we
feared they might be. ‘
tainlylrisen, but not as much as was feared. Even
A - now the cost of. living is lower in Belgium than in

: other countries. . *- 
 ,3 “Of our 607,000 insured workers, only 11,000
’ are entirely unemployed, while 19,000 are on part

 

time. All the trade unions are raising their dues, .

and yet their membership is rising.”

Great Lakes for many years, has become a pirate

, 0115 times carried the names of Trader, Blue Hill, _

ASTROLOGY PUT TO A NEW USE

The latest development of astrological science}, 
in which many people seem to believe, is that of;
forecasting accidents to steamships, ra.ilro2r'd e
trains, or airplanes; or of explaining after the
event the astral reasons that caused_it to happen.‘ V
Serious consideration is given to the matter by M.
‘Scriabiiie in the Revue d’Astrologie_ in which he

_ lays. down the rules upon which horoscopes are to

be cast. ‘ p . x

F It is necessary to know the exact time of the
birth of a person whose fate is to be read in the
stars. But what is the date of thenativity of ~21. T
boat, a ﬂying machine or a railroad train? Clea—r~ _
ly enough, we are told. that of a vessel is the mo-

, ‘merit in whichit is launched, and that ofaan air it

craft when it ﬁrst~risps from the earth. ‘That of a i

, railroad train is less easy to determine, since the

'9, ational Child Labor Committee, there are .

. ever could notproduce its unfavorable eife'ct'_,upo,n"‘ 
‘ /

engine and the cars may have been built and put ,
into use at different times; so as a compromise the
time when the train sets out from ‘the station on .
any given run must be taken as that of its, Q
nativity. ‘ V * *  «
On"su,ch a basis M. Scriabine undertakes to d¢~ ,.
termine and describe the astral causes of Various
recent railwayaccidents, casting horoscope}; with
a formidable array of inalign aspects. For ex-
ample: “Jupiter squared Saturn”; “Jupiter n
posed Neptune”; “Mars in ‘conjunction with ‘Um: _-
nus squared Jupiter and passed to the half—squa.re
of Uranus,” etc.——all crystal clear. no doubt, tr» 5
the adept, but bewildering to the mere layman‘.
However. there comes’ at the end this saving, ‘j
clause:l.“From such planetary aspects has prey-‘
ceeded a torrentof cosmic’ inﬂuences, which hov-
