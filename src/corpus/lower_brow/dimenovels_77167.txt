 Mr. Horatio Belden’s splendid ‘house, on Fifth

A servant took his card and Nick waited in the re-

Presently Mrs. Van Pelt came in, looking sur-
prised and somewhat disturbed.

“Mr. Carter?” she said, inquiringly.

“Yes, madam,” he answered. “You are annoyed
to receive a call from a detective?"

“Hardly that,” she responded, “but surprised."

“Especially as this detective is one you never saw
before.”

“True.”

“Permit me, then, to state my business brieﬂy.
There is to be a reception at your house this even-
ing.

He concluded by giving Patsy directions for Chick

— Nick, after making a complete change in his ape
pearance, went by a very rqundabout way to the flat

a he had engaged.

 

He feared that his unknown enemy would shadow
him. and. xirhile the great detective had no alarm for l_
his safety. he did dread to have his movenients (ll$~ff it
covered. ' it

That was because his heart was set not only on/1:
capturing the society thief. but on learning through?
him who the chief ‘of the criminals was.

 

  

Nick’s plan for the evening was one of the shrewd:
est he had ever made. , i
The circumstances of the Wendell robbery, whi
has been referred to; made him suspect that"the

 these three, because two were not among the

Nick knew a good deal about the neighborhood,
as a case had taken him into this very building.

He remembered chasinga criminal over the roofs,
and as soon as his furniture was put in he went up
to the roof to see if there had been any changes since
his last visit;

All was as it had been, and he breathed a sigh of
satisfaction.

“Now, if all works well,” he said to himself, “and
the fellow takes the bait, we shall have him where
we can talk business.”

Late in the day, Chick, Mr. Brown‘s “brother,”
came with a couple of traveling bags, in which were

contained changes of clothing that they would need

for their work. _

“Ida is at the \Valdorf-Astoria,” said Chick, “and
will be ready at ten o’clock.”

Nick nodded, and they went to dinner at a res-
taurant.

A little before ten o'clock they were putting on
the ﬁnishing touches to-their disguises in the flat.

Nick appeared to be an elderly man, Chick some-
what younger. Both would have been taken for
foreigners and men of great wealth..

Each wore a high hat. and full evening suits.

For ortcegthey took none of the articles of their
business that they usually carried with them, ex-
cept a revolver apiece. ,

Pocket lanterns, handcuffs, false beards, make—up

paints, all such things were left behind.

“Don’t you think,” said Chick, as they were ready
to start, “that we’d better have at least a pick~lock,
in case-—--“’

“No,” said Nick. “If it won’t work the way I
have planned, it wor‘i’t work at all. Besides, I have
a fancy for doing this thing single~handed, so to
speak. We'll, play robbers to-night, Chick, and
teach this fellow some lessons in his own business.’.'

So saying, he heldhthe door of the flat open for
Chick’ to pass out. . » ‘

Immediately the cab was driven down the street
to where Chick and his prisoner stood. a

“Want to work out the rest of that dollar?” asked
Chick.

‘_‘Wel1,” replied the cabman, disappointed, “a fare’s

3!

a fare, you know

The detective laughed.

‘‘All right, cabby,” he said; “here's another fare,”
and he handed up a bill.

“Yes, sir; where°to ?”

Chick and his prisoner got into the cab, and the
detective gave his order through the trap: '

“Grand Central Police Station.”

“Yes, sir.” _ ‘

“Say, cabby!”

“Yes, sir?” /V '

“Go down by Madison avenue. ' No more Fifth
avenue on this trip; see ?"

“All right, sir.”

Chick's reason for this was that if they went down
Fifth avenue the shadow might recognize Nick's car-
riage. Then, if by anyaccident the fellow should
escape, he might have information that would be
troublesome when used against Nick.

So the cabtook them to the Grand Central police
station by the Madisonnavenue route, and when they
arrived Chick had one of the patrolmen on duty
there to go to the messenger office in the station for
a telegram blank and an envelope.

The patrolman brought several blanks and envel-
opes and took them into the captain’s room, where
Chick had gone with his prisoner. V ,

Up to that time the defective had not said a wor
to the man.

message. V . _

The quick way in which he wrote the initials
proved to Chick that they were ones that would
arouse no suspicions in Gaylord’s mind. .

He put the message ill the envelope and sealed it.

“Oh! there’s one thing more,” said Chick, as if
he had forgotten something; “did Gaylord expect
you to send word to him, or call with it?”

John Doe's lips were pressed together for all in-
stant, and his eyes wavered.

“He expected me to bring him word,” he an-
swered. ,

“You lie!” remarked Chick, quietly. “He told
you it would be better not $0 show yourself at his
house late at night.”

The shadow struck his list violently on the desk.

“You're on to everything!" he muttered’.

Chick smiled, but.said notlling. He had done

solne first rate guessing and blufﬁng, and all the

tricks were his.

John Doe was locked up, and, it may as well be
said here that, as he proved to be a man for whom
the police had a warrant, that Nick, after the ,night’s
work was done, left him to be held on Qlavt ‘warrant,
as there was enough in that to keep him in jail for a,
long time. p '

‘Chick took the message around to the messengef
oﬂice, and had it sent to Gay1ord’s address. ,

Then he went back to the Savoy to wait for Nick.

He gave herhis arm, and slowly they made their
way through the throng. ‘ '

They went‘ into the hall, where Ida left him and
ascended the stairs, while Black returned to the din-
ing-room by another door.

A moment later Nick quietly disar;eared.

He went to the gentlemen’s dressing—room and
put on his overcoat, took his hat, and stepped into

v the upper hall to wait for Ida.

She meantime had put on her cloak and made
ready to leave the house. '

In this she was assisted by a single servant, who -

had been left in the room to help late comers.
Fortunately for Ida’s plan a late comer entered
just as she was ready to go, and while the ‘servant
wasbusy with the new arrival, Ida slipped into an ad-
joihing. 1-oom_ _
If the servant noticed that she had gone, she
doubtless supposed that she had gone into the hall.

The room Ida entered was used ordinarily as a.

dressing-room by Mrs. Van Pelt, and next beyond it
was her bedroom. .,

To-night neither the dressing—room nor the bed-
room were supposed to be in use. _
' Ida wept softly to the bedroom door, and, with the
utmost caution, turned the handle.

She found, as she expected, that the door was
locked. ' I

Thenlshe listened, and, after a moment, was quite
certain that she heard somebody moving inside.

‘Steps seernell to he approaching the @109?-

Foster was thinking of the gigantic strength dis-
played by the man,.who had lifted him and thrown

ever they are. I am not jealous of Nick Carter,
Mrs. Van Pelt. If it was any other detective, per-
haps I might be, but Carter is the king of us all,
madam, and he has his own way of doing things. If
it was he, he will tell me all about it when the right
time comes, and will do everything he can to make
up for turning me down as he did. Meantime, we

‘shall gain nothing by saying anything about it, and’

if we said anything it might happen to block Carter,
and that must not happen.”

“I think you take a very generous view of it,” she
said.

Foster bowed. A .

“I take off my hat to Nick Carter every time,” he
remarked. 4 . . ,

They started to leave the room, when she hesi-
tated. , —

“There’s Mr. Gaylord.” she said, remembering
that ‘he knew what had happened. “He will ask
questions———”

“Tell him," interrupted Foster, “that I think the
thief was Spontini’s daughter. That will do no’
harm, and I'm not yet sure that it isn't the truth.”

Mrs. Van Pelt gave this message to Gaylord

“I suppose it may be so,” he answered, thought-I

it. I’ve reckoned all along that he hides it some-
where in the ﬂat until he has a chance to take it to
the fence."

They were standing in Gaylords sitting-room.
It was a splendidly furnished place. The chairs
were of the most expensive kind. there were costly
paintings on the walls. the ﬂoor was covered with
elegant rugs, and on the mantels were vases and
gold and silver ornaments.

pointing to the ﬁreplace.

That was the one part of the room where the arti-
cles in sight were. not expensive.
hung a pair of boxing gloves, a set of foils, a fencing
mask, and other things of that_sort, and on the ﬂoor
beside the grate was a pair of Indian clubs.

Nick nodded and went to a cabinet in a corner.

It had glass doors, and on its shelves were various
medals for success in athletic contests. A

The detective tried the cabinet door. It opened
readily, and he sounded the interior for secret draw-
ers.

. .

Meantime Chick was searching behind the picture
frames, and in other places.

“Hardly likely to be in tl.iS room, anyway,” said
Nick. "Let's try his bathroom and bedroom.”

A It took but a minute to satisfythentithat nothing}
was hidden in the ﬁrst—named room. In the bed-

room it was another matter.
A" good mariy articles of furniture were "there, and

it took some‘ time to investigate them all.‘

Not a drawer, was locked. Everything they

touched opened readily, but nothing was discovered A

that was not perfectly innocent. _ e g
"This is beginning to look skittish,” said Chick. 1

Chick turned his half of the club upside down,‘ and ,_",
there rolled out thousands and thousands of dollars’  3»

“Better than _I thought,” muttered Nick. “Here
are some of the things stolen from the Wendells,
and all the plunder he gotilast night from the Belg
dens. Put the club together again, Chick, and stand .
itup in the ﬁreplace just as'we found it.” p

Chick did so, while Nick carried thejewels in his
handkerchief to the bedroom and placed them on a
bureau.

Therehe knotted the corners of the handkerchief.
so as to make a bag of it. _'

“Nearly twelve,” he remarked, looking at his
watch. “Better turn off, thellights, Chick.” A

His assistant obeyed, feelingan excitement the
was not usual to him when chasing criminals; for,
Chick knew thattthe most diﬁicult part of their gain,
was yet to be played. _

“\Vhat‘s the matter with retiring on a fortune?”
he asked, with a keen look at Chick.

“Do you mean that you'll divide?" asked the de-
tective.

"Yes. Three equal parts. Two for you men,'one
for me. What could be fairer?"

“Nothing, but it don't go."

“Then," exclaimed Gaylord, suddenly, “take

nothing and die l"

\Vith the words he leaped upon Chick, and gave
him a violent push, so that the detective fell back
full length on the bed.

At thesame time Gaylord touched a spring with '
his foot and the bed shut up instantly.

Chick was caught in it. unable to move a muscle
and (loomed to smother to death unless quickly res-
cued.

In less than the two minutes he had spoken of
Nick returned. He had not been further than the
general hall of the building.

He found the lights as he had left them, but it was
suspiciously still in the bedroom. '
. He hurried in there and took in the situation at :1

glance. .

Down came the bed with a bang!

Chick sat up and gasped.

“Gee!” he said, “that was a close call.”

“W here’s that fellow gone?” demanded Nick, in
an angry tone. A

“How the devil do you suppose I know?” retorted

’ Chick, with an equal show of angels.

Nick ran to the open window. .\.

“Down the ﬁre escape,”V he said.

“Well,” suggested Chick, “ain’t we better off as it
is?” _ '

“Yes,” replied Nick, “that’s -so. I didn't know
what to do with him, but I’d have felt safer to knock
him on the head somewhere. However, he won’t_
dare tell on us. Think «of that,» Billy! He won’:

At  moment there was another long ﬂash and
a furious clap of thunder. .

’' >A ‘the light they saw Gaylord standing as before
h his revolver leveled at them.

’ There was the look of calm desperation in his eye
that showed that he meant business.

“And there's something more,” said Gaylord,

" g" ctly, and I know how to dispose of the stuff
thearly its full value." —

_In the darkness Nick gave Chick a nudge.

Tflre plan was working around to the point he had
ped for,

“The fact is,” added Gaylord. “that if we divide
and you leave the fence to me. I can get so much

“Nor do we. but we'd like to see him out of the
way.” .

“You shall. That's all arranged."

“Another flash of lightning came. and Gaylord
started a little, as he saw that each of the detectives
was pointing a revolver at him.

Nick laughed. ,

“Speaking of who's got the advantage,” he said,
“I reckon it's about hoss and hoss, ain't it? Now,
guvnor. we want to talk this thing out fair and

“You’re right.” .

“\'Vill you come down to our den?

“All right.

- By the light of another ﬂash, Gaylord saw the de-
tectives pocketing their weapons.

He did the same, and said:

“Lead on.” -

Nick stepped over the opening to the neitt roof,
and Chick’ followed him.

“Look out for the open space,” called Nick, warn-
ingly.

In the darkness they heard Gaylord approaching.

He hhd just put his foot on the low parapet of
the roof when there came the most blinding ﬂash.

On the instant there was a terriﬁc crash and roar,

It’s ‘the top

and tearing into pieces.

Both Nick and Chick felt the sickly faintness that
comes to all when they are in: the very midst of a
discharge of electricity.

They heard the falling of bricks and knew that at

chimney within a few feet of them had been struck.
But they saw something that was far worse than

latter for three dollars in good _conditiou. I893 Colum-
bian half dollars are selling for seventy-ﬁve cents at the
dealers.

A. B.—We do not know of any “St. Louis Expedition
stamp." If you mean the two cent Omaha, it has no
value at present. * l

B. E.—--All of the stamps you describe are common
and worth very little. The envelope stamp is a Colum-
bian, and the three cent locomotive was issued in 1869.

H. M.—An 1843‘ quarter. if fine, is worth half a dol-
lar. The Mexican silver coin is a one-fourth real, and
this design was used between 1841 and 1861. They
usually bring 15 cents. M0 is the mint mark of the city
of Mexico. '

N. A.——Your rubbing is taken from a Bank of Eng-
land dollar, I804. This was struck during the reign of
George III., and. as far as we know, is the only purely
English coin with the word dollar on. It is worth two
dollars and ﬁfty cents. ‘

A. S. A.——-The one. two, live, eight and ten cent
stamps of the United States were surcliarged “Porto
Rico." Afterward the one and two cents were sur-
charged “Puerto Rico.” The spelling on the higher
values was not changed. _ '

N. B.—An American half dollar of 1809 is worth
seventy-ﬁve cents, and an einreich thaler I778 uf Fred-
erick II. (1740-86), of Germany, is worth two dollars.
The “model penny"-and the ordinary half penny and
pennies of V_ictoria'are all common.

R. 'I‘.—i84g dime. twenty-ﬁve cents. Your other cop-
per rubbings are from common Canadian, English and
Frenclfooins. The one you are more particularly anx-
ious about isa French double tournois of Henry IV.
(.1590-1610), 1608, and is worth thirty cents.

A. B.‘-'--Therelare several varieties of the five cent, ﬁfty
‘cent and onedollar values of United States Internal Reve-
nue stamps of 1866. This is dependent upon the inscrip-
tion in the lower label of the stamp. They vary in value
from one cent each for the common ones to ﬁve dollars

, each for the scarcest.

F. P.—Yonr coin is a two real of Charles III.
(17679-89)  Spain. ‘The mint mark Mo., on the reverse,
shows that it was coined in Mexico for use in that coun-
try, then belonging to Spain. The arms on the reverse
are those of Spain, Lions and Castles, for Leon and Cas-
tilc, the two original provinces of Spain.
