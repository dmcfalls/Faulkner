friends and patrdns departed. ' ,

Dick accompanied Brad to a room on the sec-
ond ﬂoor, where there was a bed large enough»
to accommodate two. The boys turned in and”,
were soon asleep. Dick was usually a sound‘
sleeper, but something aroused him that night.

He looked around the room, and his gaze was
arrested at the window. -The lower sash was up;
and a man was in the act of getting in. There
was enough light for the boy to recognize the
intruder. It was Sam Hickey. ‘ '

CHAPTER IV.—Checkmating a Ruffian.

Dick was greatly startled, not only by this?
midnight invasion, but by the fact that the in-
truder was Sam Hickey, which assured him that
he was the object of the man‘s attention. He-
punched Brad" in the side in so vigorous a way‘
that Smith. woke up.’ By that time. Hickey was
in the room, and was making forrthe chair 0
which stood Dick's suitcase, half open. The;
young tenderfoot was not wanting in luck.
After punching his companion into wakefu ness,j
he sprang out of bed and made a dash at
Hickey. . 

“Hold on there, what are you doing in tihi
rbom?” he cried, grabbing the fellow by the

down, grabbed the suitcase and made for the"
window. Brad, however, was quicker than he.’
The station agent's’ nephew sprang over the foot?
of the bed and collared the'intruder. 4,». '

“Drop that case, Sam Hickey. What in’ thim
der are you doing in here at this hour of the
night? Trying to hook my friend's case? Thi
is bad business for you to be engaged it. You
know your reputation ain’t none of the best, and
this piece of work won't help it any." _ .

Hickey was somewhat staggered when Brad;
Smith grabbed him, and it was a moment or two’
before e made a move. He didn’t drop the suit
case, but partially shaking Brad off-, he drew hi
revolver and shoved it in'the boy's face. 

“Git back to bed,” he said, ﬁercely, “and if yer’-.
utter a yawp I'll send yer to kingdom come."

Brad was no coward, but a cocked revolver
pointed within an inch of his nose, by a man.

he found the chance, and then 0’Leary whipped
‘up his horses and‘ drove off, leaving the boy

"himself, asche started oif up the narrow ‘break in

"and he lost sight of the level country in his rear.
‘He soon found himself in the midst of the
D’ iwildest and most romantic scenery he had ever
been brought face to face with.
" The well-deﬁned road was the only thing that
. reminded him of civilization.
T _It went up and up through the range, curving
around precipitous spots where the mountain side
had been cut away to aiford room for a team to
piss, and bridged here and there where its course

-ahd.he was hot and tired before he had’ got half
WK through the rugged pass. _ .
lthough Dick had been sensible of the dry

    
   
  
  
    
   
   
  
   

heat of Arizona ever since he struck the State,
‘lie was willing ‘to swear. that this walk was
through the hottest section, he had struck yet,
7-though the afternoon sun had declined so far that
the road was always in the shade. _

There wasn’t a breath of air to cool his fevered
brow, and he looked in vain for some stream or
even rill in which to lave his face and cool his

parched tongue. I ’  .

' “Finally he sat down on at rock behind some
, sérub bushes and mopped his forehead with his
 handkerchief. . 4 _

“O’Leary said‘ this pass was about half /a mile
through,” He muttered; “but it seems to me the

‘biggest half, mile I ever tried to walk. I ought to

ﬁe somewhere near the end of it, but I dor_i’t see

any indication of the fact. Lord, I almost wish I’d

hired a horse. This suit case feels as if it was

loaded with silver ore, thoughvait was light enough
when I parted from O’Leary. Well, what’s_ the use
of kicking? I won’t reach Redrock any quicker by

‘ inakingla fuss over this tramp.”

 ,At t at moment Dick saw a couple of rough-
 ‘looking, bearded men come running down the

road. T

3 When they almost reached the spot where the

 sat they jumped behind a big boulder, as if

‘hiding from/.some one. ,

, ”“I. wonder who they are, and what they are up

t_o‘.?” thought Dick. “Their actions are decidedly

.'ausp.ic1ous.?’

Just then he heard the slow gallop of a hbrse

“O’Léary said she was a corking ﬁne girl, and?
Brad Smith told me she was a spanker and 1511

‘claims outside of the known silver belt are rather
problematical as mining propositions?” said Dick.
““Yes, that is the way I look at it. . everal out-

results , that justify my statement. . Only the
mines that have been opened up adjoining my own
have amounted to anything as paying producers,
and, as I said, they are not meeting the anticipa-
tions of their owners. The further away a claim
is, the less chance there is that it will turn out
to be valuable, though I will admit. there are ex-
ceptions to the rule. Such exceptions are very
noticeable: in the Goldﬁeld and Bullfrog districts.

CHATTER IX.—Captured by the Bandits.»

 That afternoon, Mr. Long, his daugter and Dick
wentvto Florence by stage and put, up at the
Florence House. 1 The mining king saw the chief
of police and .it was arranged that the two ban-
~ dits be brought before the court on the following
morning. That evening Dick took Susanne to a
"show at the small opera house given by a company
of. third-rate Thespians who were touring
Arizona. On their way back to the hotel after
,the show the two young people, whose movements
had been watched by friends of the captured
‘ bandits from the’ moment they entered the town,
‘were suddenly surrounded by four"armed men,
" and before Dick could make a move to protecthis
fair companion, both were seized, gagged and
"hustled u a dark street, where horses stood wait-
ing. Dic and Susanne were bound on the back
of one of the animals, the ruﬁians mounted the
other horses, and, without hardly a word being
.spoken\ since the hold-up, the party started off at
in ‘rapid gait for the San Topaz range- The leader
'/of , e_. gang held the rope that guided the animal
on which the prisoners were bound, and he led the
way. The feelings of Dick and Susanne may be
-better imagined than desecribed. Though bound
close together they could not communicate with
each other, owing to the gags that stopped their
mouths. » ' .

H’ That they were in the hands of unknown en-
emies there could be no doubt, and what their
fate was to be was a problem-for the present.

In the course of an hour the party entered the
mountain through a wild and rocky ravine a mile
north of Dead Man’s Pass. -

, After that the difficulties of the way made
progress slow, and more than another hour
elapsed before a sudden turn of the dangerous

cave, riﬂe in hand.

of the new arrivals.

..“I see yer have,” replied Barney in a tone of
‘satisfaction.

“Are the boys in the cave?”

“Every mother’s son of\’em have been asleep

ties as they continued down.‘ There were places
where it failed them entirely, and they had to

her steps when she grew faint‘. and weary after

' several hours of tramping. At last they reached
 the ravine which they remembered was the one

they ‘had entered the range through, and they
felt encouraged. If nothing happened to them
here they might soon expect to reach the plain,

connected. In a few minutes they continubd‘~bn
their way, and when the thud oftheir animals’
hoofs died away Dick and Susanne came joﬁt 4;
their hiding-place. . 
“That was Bud Dalton and his’. pal, Sam
Hickey,” said the boy as they walked on. “Dalton
is the man I met at the hotel in Phoenix, and
who purposely misdirected me on my way to
Redrock in order’ that I might fall into the
clutches of his associate. I told you how I met
Hickey at Tuscarora station. He’s a hard‘ case.
It’s a good thing they did not see us or there
would have been some shooting done.” 4 .
Half an hour later they got out of the range
at last and started for Dead Man's Pass. ‘ » "
reached it in about twenty zpinute ‘
their faces toward Redrock. They
plished half the distance when the sound of hor
men at a rapid gallop reached their ears.. *

/‘Who can that be?” said Susanne. “Perhaps
my father and some of his friends on the.,way’~
to the camp to start all the boys on a general
hunt through the range for us.” ~

“Or it may be part of the bandits on ou_
trail,” replied Dick. “We must hide, for we can-’ _
afford to take any chances.” » , ‘ . l 

The gray dawn was ’ust beginning to 1i" htea
up the eastern sky. 'JDick looked aroung has
some spot for his companion and himself to con-

., a. short time before with word that usanne Long
 and the young stranger from the ast had dis-
“appeared the night before, and it was suspected
they had been kidnapped from the town by dis-
gguised bandits and taken into the range. The
/message was an order from the minin king to
{his employees to arm themselves and scour the
3 range in small arties. A dozen of them were
already mounte and prepared to set oiét when‘
:‘the sound of shooting in the direction of e pass
;reached their ears. They lost no time in spurrin
-in that direction as hard as they..could go, wit
their riﬂes ready for business. They dashed up
:the declivity and rushed into the pass like a
whirlwind. As the ﬁring continued at frequent
intervals they were at no loss to locate the ex,-
-act spot where the trouble was. The bandits
"were fast closing in on Dick and Susanne, who
. ad almost exhausted their cartridges, and their
rate seemed about settled, when the party from
?-Redrock came upon the scene. The rascals heard
their approac in time to scatter for safety.
 Those who ad come on horseback rushed for
their animals, mounted and rode at breakneck
speed down the pass, leading three horses with
them, the owners of which ay wounded in the
road.‘ .

mountain, made off the way they had come with

after inspecting what had.been accomplished: ‘

agreed, and an hour later the party reached’ the

CHAPTER XI.—At the Mouth of the Shaft.

. “You stood nobly by my dear child, and have
increased the debt of gratitude that I already
owe you,” said Mr. Long to‘.Dick, after he had,
heard the -story of the night's adventure from h‘
daughter’s lips. ‘ ’ . ,- ‘

“You don’t suppose I would desert her, even if
I could have saved myself by so doing?” replied
the boy. “She was in my care when I took, her
to the show, and, of course, it‘ was my dutyto
look out for her. However, she did her share to-
ward our escape, and I'm bound to say that she’:
the nerviest little girl I ever met. She never
ﬁinched under the ﬁre of_the bandits, and the
way thebullets pinged around us was enough to‘
try any one’s courage.” . .

After a wash-up Dick and Susanne went to.
breakfast with Mr. Long, and later onthey‘ ap-

ared in court when Burns and Mullen were
« rought up for examination.

Their testimony was enough to cause the judge
to hold the two rascals for trial, and they were
sent back to jail. ' - ~

Dick, Susanne and the mining yking returned
to Redrock after dinner. "1‘he camp knew all
about the young people’s abduction from Flor-
ence, their escape from their captors, and thetdes-.
perate stand they had made against the bandits
in the pass,- consequently they rmeived an
tion on entering the place. 1

Next morning, Mr. Long having satisﬁed him-
self that there was something in the declaratiori
of the late Dan Harker that there was silver ore
in the Red Crow claim, sent an expert prospector
to the property to verify the dead man’s co_

    
  
   
  
  
  
    
  
    
   
  
    
   
 
  
   
   
 
     
 

The report he made bore out Harker’s asser-
tion, and on the strength of it Mr. Long 1;. _.
Dick that he would open up a mine on thepro ,
erty at his own expense. ’ .
V It was arranged that Dick would superintend,
the opening up of his own mine under the a -;
vice and assistance of one of the mining king?‘
superintendents. The boy insisted that Mr. L0 .
should keep. an account of the money he Bldg-
vanced for the purpose of developing the mine,
the same to be repaid out of the proﬁts of pro-
duction. , V,

The mining king agreed to this proposal with‘
evident reluctance, but Dick was ﬁrm on the point
and would, not have it otherwiseu v  V

The working of the new mines brought more

But looks didn’t interfere with a man getting

She darted up to her room, got her hat, an

In the meantime, Dick had reached his prope

and was walking toward the ‘building wheIe.gll2$‘i ‘

dogged by two men in the darkness. . . , 
These men were the two miners who had sliowii

They were brawny, hard looking" fellows, .

hung around a. saloon on the opposite side of»i1;lji‘e

Dick whenever he appeared outside. . 

On this evening they followed him as he start
away from the hotel on his errand to the mine,

‘ “Dear, dear Dick, do open your eyes and speak; 
to me,” she cried, her tears falling‘ on his white
face, that looked somewhat ghastly in the light‘ , ,
of the lantern. While she was trying to bring? s..
him, the watchman from the adjoining mine, who "_j.
had heard the shooting, came running over to  5.1
what the trouble was about. He wasastonished ‘I
when he recognized the mining king’s daughter 
bending over the senseless owner of the’  ’

 
 

Crow claim. , _
“What has happened, miss?” he asked, seeing ,» g
the body of Duncan stretched out close by whe're”« ‘
he had fallen under the girl's ﬁre. ' '_ ,
“Please help me do something for Mr. Alvord,”' -
cried Susanne with feverish eagerness. “He’s 

been badly hurt by two rascals who attacked 
just before I came. Please do something to 
hinito his senses.” v ~ ’ ‘

“He’s not dead. He does not appear to have « .
been shot. .Ah, I see, a lump on his head. He.’ v

The watchman took out his whisky ﬂask and 
poured‘ some liquor down the boy's throat. This D
revived him after a moment or two, and he looked
up into Susanne’s face. ' ~ _

_“You here, Susanne?”‘ he exclaimed, in a

“Yes, yes. How did this terrible thing hap-‘

“Yes, I shot them both. One fell into the shaft,

 ‘-.‘.Take. another drink, pard,” said the watchman.
3'-"‘N‘o, I‘ don’t need it,” he said, getting on his
feet, assisted by the girl.

"He felt kind of wobbly on his pins and stag-
»,gered some. Susanne grabbed him by the arm and
“ steadied him. ,

5 “Is that one of the chaps?” he asked her as
n the watchman turned the rascal on his back.
 ,,‘‘Yes,’’ she replied with a shudder, for now
. that» the excitement was over she began to realize
that she had probably badly injured two human
;I beings.

. "He’s' senseless,” said the watchman. “He's
been hit twice. His arm is broken and there is a

ball somewhere in his carcass.”

" “Then he should be carried to a doctor at once,”
, said Dick. ‘

‘- “If you can lift him into my buggy do so, and
I .will carry him to Doctor Smith,” said Susanne
" to the watchman.

At that juncture two more men came on the

"scene. They had been drawn by the ﬁring, and
i came from the Susanne mine. They recognized
the girl, and wondered if she had been in another

scrape- The situation was explained to them,.and
. they. helped to put the badly wounded man into
,the buggy. When they learned that the other
’ ‘ruﬁian had fallen down the shaft they said there
"was no doubt that his goose was cooked. How-
 Dick asked them to get him up, which they
could easily do b means of the ore—raising tub
_ and the hand win lass.

,» Leaving them to attend to the matter, Dick
~hel.ped Susanne into the buggy and then got in

‘himself. ‘They drove as ast as possible to
= i Doctor Smith’s house, and on the way Susanne
explained more fully the state of affairs when she
3 arrived at the mine.

-- 7; ,‘V‘It’s dreadful .to think /that I have injured those
men,” she said; “but it was to save your life, and
21 do not regret what I did."

' “I can’t understand the object the men had in
{attacking me,” replied Dick. “This wounded man
in‘ one of the hands employed on my mine.
gWh'ether his companion was also of my workers
could not say until I see him. What they had’
/gagainst me is a mystery as far as I am con-
, c.eriied.”. .

'  Doctor Smith was in his office reading when
_they'drove up. He came out at once and helped

Dick carry the wounded man into his operating-
A‘ room. 'After‘examining him, the doctor said he
,wns dangerously wounded, and it was doubtful

CHAPTER XIV.-—The Road to Freedom.

. “T1i'rn.out of the stage, every one of you,” was
the next command of Bud Dalton, in a..tono.9that
' showed he would_take no fooling. T

of the ban its they had till that moment sup-

‘_ ations by them had recently been reported.
.: .Resistance under the circumstances was un-
a'vailin , and all the victims of the holdup were
I present y lined up in the road under the guns of
_ several‘ of the bandits. _ ‘
 "‘-Get the boxes of bullion out of the driver's
. box,” said Dalton to Hickey, and that worthy
-_ qu¥:kly obeyedorders.
. here were six boxes, and these were tumbled
V into the road, smashed open, and their contents
. distributed in the pouches brought for the pur-
pose, the whole amount being divided as equally
asqpossible among the rascals.

 _he’mail ba was then taken off the stage,

» thrown into the bushes. _ \\

_ _- "Now, boys search the prisoners," cried the
. leader of the and. ‘ M
’  -As all hands had a bunch of money to spend
. at the ball, the rascals made a good haul in cash.
_' _Da.lton's next order was to tie all hands, and

theyﬂwere tied, Susanne and the other two girls
, having their hands secured behind their backs,
_-‘while the men were trussed u hand and foot.

" “Now, then,” said Dalton, ‘we'll be of. Fetch
up the horses."
‘ The horses were brought.

~ "Tie a handkerchief around her mouth first.” ,.
- ‘ Susanne was passed up to him and he placed
r herin-front of him. '
“Sam, you take charge of the boy."
’ Hickey mounted his horse and two of the ban-
dits tied Dick on behind him.
v “All ready?” cried Dalton.

“All ready, cap.”

“Then forward at your best speed.”
‘ Dalton led the wa down'the pass, followed
by his band. When t ey struck the road outside
_ they turned northward and sped along at high

speed. After an hour’s ride they turned again
3 into the mountains and then they went along at
'21. more leisurely gait. By paths that they knew
better than any one else they penetrated deeper
 and deeper into the range till, as darkness fell
, upon the face of nature, a short halt was called
0 water the horses.
 . The gloom of the mountains did not seem to
bother the bandits much, for they-kept on with-
' out another halt for two hours more. After rest-
,’~in_g twenty minutes the journey was resumed at
Cagzslower pace. After a long ride they ﬁnally

found them several miles from the bandits’ cave.
“The rascals have no doubt discovered our es
cape by this time, and I’ll bet they're madde
than a nest full of disturbed hornets,” said Dick.
“They are sure to scour the whole of the rangef
within‘ miles of, the cave in order to recaptureus
and we are likely to have a hard time avoiding
them.” . ~ - , _. I '-
“We must do our best,” replied Susanne.  "
“Well, you can bet we’ll do that.” . , »
They continued on at the best pace ‘Susann
was capable of, noting by the glow of the rising,
sun that they were into the upper, part of the _.
level ground to the west of the range. After’
another hour’s walk Susanne was so tired that‘
a halt was called" for a rest. They reclined 0111
the ground for half an hour and then resume
their ﬂight. As morning advanced they felt th_'
cravings of a pair of healthy appetites, for the
hadn’t “eaten anything since their dinner at noon
the day before, ‘ . g , J _
The chances of getting anything to eat for»
some little time to come were small, so they had
to bear their hunger as best they_could. Around 1
noon they struck a well-deﬁned road, somewhatto
their surprise and satisfaction. ‘ - .
“I have no doubt but this will take up rigli
out of the range, for it certainly is not here for
fun. It must cross ‘the mountains from one side
to the other. ' ' '

judgedithat the bandits were not provided with
vehicles of any kind, which was quite true, as}
such articles could not have been driven into the
almost trackless wilds where they had their head ’
quarters. ~ "- _ ~

an empty’ wagon and a team of horses driven‘ by a,

"Allow me to lift you up, Susanne. This is Su-
_, §a'nne Long, daughter of Redrock’s mining king.”
Dick then entered into full articulars of the
pholdup, and then described their ride bound and
' agged, to the cave of the bandits somewhere up
e mountains.
 After that ‘he told how they managed to make
i their escape by way of a rear passage that let
. them out in a ravine down the mountain-side.“
“That was before sunset, and we've been walk-
g ever since, save for short spells of rest. It
was mighty lucky for us that we struck this road.
Neither of us knew anything about it, and it was
- - ust a lucky ﬂuke that we hit it, and still more
’ ucky that you came along with ur wagon to
4 've us a lift. Susanne is about one for in the
alking line, and I‘ don't know how we should
,_ ‘have along if you or some one else with a
" ‘team adn’t come along,” said Dick.
’ 0’Leary said he was glad to be of service to
them, and congratulated them over their escape
from the rascally bandits. An hour’s ride car-
ried them out of the range into the level country.
‘ ‘O’Lea said he'd ta’ e them to the ranch,
where r. Mason and his family would give
them a hearty welcome and ﬁx them up in good
shape- -
. When >O’Leary drove up to the ranch-house Mr.
Mason happened to be on hand, and he regarded
Dick and the much-bedraggled Susanne with con-
giderable curiosity, not dreaming who they were.
When he found out that the girl was the
daughter of Redrock’s mining kin , and that the
boy was Dick Alvord, famous t roughout. the
country as the dwner of the Red Crow silver
' mine, he was a much astonished man. He called
his wife and daughters and turned Susanne over
31:07’ them, and took Dick to his own apartments,
"after ordering a meal to be prepared for them
without delay. _
‘Offcourse, Dick's story explained everything to
uthe wealthy ranchman. ‘
 Susanne also told her story to Mrs. Mason and
her two daughters while attiring herself in a
-gown loaned to her and otherwise repairing dam-
ag‘es.with the help of the three women.
» -Half an’ hour after their arrival’ Dick and
' Susanne sat down toquite a spread in the dining-
room, and both declared that a meal had never
gaelfotre tasted so good, for they were quite fam-
s e . ,
Mr. Mason sent a man on horseback to Red-
rock to notify Mr. Long that his daughter and
Dick were safe at his home, where he intended
to keep them for a few days. ‘
1 ‘Then, while Mrs. Mason and the girls'laid
themselves -out to entertain Susanne, the ranch
owner/took Dick around his bi ‘property, and
pointed out all his possessions o gimportance,
Dick and Susanne remained several -days at
 Mason ranch and enjoyed themselves greatly,
‘after which O’Leary drove them in a. carriage
hack to Redrock, where they were received with
1 great enthusiasm.
._ ' Mr. Long sent for the sheriff of the county and
~11 ' "a strenuous talk with"him.

The sheriff agreed to do his best. He collected 
a strong posse, and, reinforced with Mr. Long’s_*-
men under Dick’s command, the expedition started .
out to put the bandits out of business. They 
came upon the band suddenly as the rascals were
preparing to start for pastures new, being afraid . 
to remain longer in the range after the escape of
their. two prisoners. " 5'1

Arirona to the satisfaction of all good citizens.‘
Dick continued to work his mine with grea
success, growing rapidly in wealth. One da he ,

There were half a dozen other brokers in th

The brokers roared with laughter, and Bob wen
quietly to work picking up the stubs ofycigarsr

the cuspidor was overturned. .

the witnesses of the incident kept on roaring _a

He was suffering great pain, and an hour later

, some one came in and told Hennessey that he had I
‘ sentfor a physician to examine into the exter.

of the injury to his big toe. It had been disl

cated, and the next morning he appeared in his

oﬂice on a pair of crutches. The foot was swolle

to such an extent that he had to wearan extra;

large slipper on it.

Some practical joker pasted alnotice on I-lien-.y

Bob’s Joke on Broker Swift

,; brokers in the building to lau hing. . . _ .
. , ‘Those who saw the lad cou dn’t doubt that he
was frightened almost out of his life. _ ,
. 1 hey all understood that fright was the cause
,,of is accident, but other messenger boys and the
’: majority of the clerks looked at the matter dif-
-'_»fe'rently, and from that ‘day not one of them
‘ dared to take any liberties with young Whiddoni
' ' The brokers,..h'owever, kept on joking him and
-Hennessey, his employer, came in for a full share
0f"it, too. Bob merely laughed and warned all
to look out, as he was laying for them and ex-
pectedto get all their ﬂeece. ‘ e
As for the boy who met with the‘ accident, he
" really believed he had been hoodooed and threat-
‘ ened to get even with young Whid on. But he
,was careful never to attempt it.
 ‘1 A few days after that Hennessey sent Bob to
. at broker’s office with a note and a bundle of pa-
. pers.
i The broker knew him well, and after reading
,the note and looking over the papers, he asked:
“Haven’t you forgotten something Bob?”
- “No, sir. I don’t think I have. That's all
" Mr. Hennessey gave me.” ’
»: “Well, how about the hoodoo?”
‘ “Oh, Mr. Hennessey didn’_t send one "to you.
But I’ll give you one for a tip.” '
,“Oh, well, I don’t want you to hoodoo me. If
-..I give you a tip I want you to hoodoo the other
;[ fellow, and let's you and I make something out
 of‘ it.’? »
.~‘ “All.right, sir. Just give me the tip."
» “But.can you keep a secret, Bob?”
, "Yes, sir; as well as any clam can."
,.  ‘-‘All right, then. You buy P. D. Q. shares and
, put’ up your last dollar in it.” -

fI’ve already invested and found it to be rather
an uncertain stock. I can give you a better one
than that, and I won't charge you anything for
't, either." '_ . . '
,“-All right. Let’s have it, and if there's any-
in it, I'll divvy with you." ~

“All right, sir; you buy D. B. T. F., and  7.
ﬁnd it a splendid investment.” ’ I '- “-
The broker looked at him inquiringly, and're,3-
marked: _
“I don’t remember that stock, Bob. Give-,
the name of it‘ again,” and he took up a penei
and piece of paper and wrote down at Bob's "dre-
tation D. B. T. F. < ’ ' 
“Who _has got any of that stock?", " - v
“I believe Mr. Hennessey has some, but I do
know at what he is holding it." \

ried out of the office. . . , . .

“0h!" and Bob began holdin his chair . t " .-
to suppress his‘ laughter. He gexplained  ﬁg
him, and he said he thought that was a pretty V

“What ‘does D. B. T. F. mean?” . ._ _j
“Well, I mean it to mean ‘don’t be too fresh

Hennessey took a couple of minutes 
him‘§‘élf together. Hethought it was a 3 le _ “ '
joke, and phoned to Swift that, he could llathim.
have a thousand shares if he would come am’: f" "
to his oﬂice.
Swift, though, was suspicious, and failed to,»
in his appearance. _
Hennessey couldn't keep’ the joketo himself;
he went into some of the offices on the same"‘ﬂ ’
and told it, and Swift soon heard of it. He "  ,
it. But Hennessey swore that it was true; tha‘l;f.ii§“,
had actually inquired of him ouer the phone abo’u;§
the stock, and for‘weeks Swift didn’t hear’ th‘ ‘
lastof it. He thought it was rank impudeii 
in a messenger boy to be so free with a‘l>'rol{fe;t;r .—..,'

  Fragments of ‘I a Bond". 

_ Well, you see, I was coming down Main street
early that morning. Indeed, it was not eight
o'clock when I left my rooms.

I had no idea it was so early, andvhad hurried
, orth, supposing it to be quite late.

 ‘ Being set right by the clock in the tower of
- ll‘rin.'ity Church, as I passed that ancient ediﬁce, I
began to take it a little more leisurely, well know-
ing that Mr. Markham, our superintendent,
‘wouldn't be in his oﬁice before nine, and that
ere was little I could do that day until after I
.. ad seen him. ‘

_' ,1 I was just thinking what a strange lull there
)was in our business, when I saw a man hurrying
_ along the street toward me. '

He was about five feet six or seven high, well
proportioned, clean shaven, hair thin on the top
of his head-—-this last I noticed as he took his
hat to wipe his forehead with a large silk hand-
kerchief which he carried in his hand.

i I had seen the man often before, but couldn’t
call him by name. .

“Oh! Mr. Fox,” said he, grabbing me by the
arm, “have you heard the horrible news? I was
'  on. my_way to your lodgings. I, want to re-
- in you in this matter, and I want the whole
;_ thing thoroughly sifted to the very bottom, yes,

even if I have to pay every cent of the expenses
myself." V
' “But you've forgot, sir,” said I, “that you

" broker and house agent on State street. And
you've no doubt also heard of Mr. Whitelock of
Grand avenue? Well, last night he was fcully,
in fact, most brutally murdered. It was only
discovered about half an hour ago by. his valet,
who came direct to me.” ‘
"V . At that moment a policeman came running
, up. .

The policeman turned away, and we hurried to

room, I entered the superintendent’s private of-
ﬁce. Within ten minutes I had all the facts
~ known at the ofﬁce at that time in my posses-
, S1011.

"  Mr. Whitelock was an old man——say sixty—eight
”,o1-‘seventy. He had survived his wife and chil-
dren by some years, and the only heir to his vast
: possession was a little grandson, a sickly child

“Very proper,” said the superintendent. ,'

I went to work on the case, but for a'

Months passed. I had had a close watch lie ,
on Walker; but we never caught him tripping‘;
