VOVACHAPTER I.-A Mexican Maid.

“‘«.‘Say, Tom, this Senorita Pepita is a peach,”
» said Bob Gillette, nodding at the handsome six-
‘ been-year-old daughter of Sebastian Castano,
landlord of the little old-fashioned Mexican inn
which the two American boys had stopped for
Vrest and refreshment. ,
A This inn stood on the outskirts of a small rus-
 village in the foothills of the Sierra de

asthe crow ﬂies, south b east, of Nogalez,
Arizona, a town close to t e Mexican border,
wpiierepthe Sonora line connected with the South-

was‘ characteristic of northern Mexico. The
:a1ley,rthrough which a dust? road wound like a
  yellow ribbon, was ferti e with semi~tx-opical
- ‘trees and vegetation, with a detached hacienda
vhere and there, its whitewashed wall peeping out
 amid a mass of green foliage. The inn

At that moment Senorita Pepita came to the ;

was decidedly bewitching. ,, i '

“My_’ mother taught me. She was a Cuban.” i
Pepita smiled. A.
“Your friend—does he also speak Spanish?”
“I regret to say he does not. He regrets it, 

  

too but never so much as now.”
“'Why, senor?” -. 5

vowed that Bruno and Anson should pay dearly‘

take the bull by the horns before the man’s asso-

came within a foot or. two of them, Tom-rose"

‘up suddenly and struck him a blow on the head’
with the butt of the revolver he carried.’ The
bandit cook fell without a cry and lay like a, dog,-
on the ﬂoor. .

“Dump him into one of these empty hampers," —
said Tom, “and then we'll be off.” ' ' ’ —

This was speedily accomplished, and the boys
glided out of the storeroom into a long passage.»

hear footsteps echoing in the distance, a door .
opened and then slammed, and voices of two men —_

no advantage to the young American lads ,1
ing for a means of egress from the old monastery
that had stood the storms and sunshine of three
hundred years. i ~. '  
There was a second very narrow door in on
of the inner walls of the room. It was‘ locked
but as the key was in it they quickly glided” so
a narrow passage which took themvto anolﬁer
door at the end of a dozen yards.  ‘
“What a building for diﬂ’ere;ot kinds
passages,” remarked Bob. '  '
The door opened on a fairly wide corrido  
some length. Numerous doors opened off it; ’
boys soon became convinced ‘that these had, ,,

“No use going up any higher,” said Bob...
there are no ﬁre escapes by which'we ci

“Neither is it safe to go down, for’

“What shall we do? Hide up here till ,'

“That is just what I was going to so '

rooms?” '
“It might be better to go up. to the next

the bandits.” ’ * ’
“Go ahead, then, and I’ll follow.’
So up they went to the landing above. Heist“ ‘
they found another corridor running the le

attention, and not believing there_was any

CHAPTER VI.-—The Two Prisoners.

The fair occupant of the room, who was evi-
dently a prisoner, turned her head with an ex-
clamation. , As he gaze rested on the boys the
‘ '1: of fear inher eyes changed to one of sur-
prise.‘ ,She looked like an American, so Tom, who

Bob left the room, and then Tom gave Mr.
Ardsle a rapid outline of the brief trip that
he an his companion had paid to Mexico, and‘ 
tlge serious adventure which had been the outcome
0 - it. \ - ‘ ‘
“Well, my boy, your coming to this place has"
been a godsend to us, for, locked in these rooms ’
as we were, we could not possibly have had a
chance to make our escape. As mattersstandk ,
now, it is by no means certain that we can gj
get away, for I counted at least thirty men in
the bandit band, and probably they are all,*or .
at any rate most of them, in this building! at ,. .
this moment. T t makes the ’odds largely
against us, and.o ly by strategy can we hope ,
to succeed.” 2 ,

“Strategy at ' ted by our revolvers.”

“Are you aigad, then?" s . y

position to make things interesting for the?
rascals,” said Tom.

Tom then said that the best plan would be to
wait till the bandits were in the eating-room ‘aft’
their dinner, and then they might count of the
coats being fairly clear for them to make a break‘ 
for the courtiard and try to escape by the ma
gate before 1: e rascals could cut them 011’. »

yells, started for the boat. The boys recognized
the chap in advance as the bandit whom they

CHAPTER XV.-—Conc1usion.

,“There’s:ts_omebo_dy up there,” said Hamlin with,
an impreca ion. . , _ ..j ‘ _
“Maybe what we heard was a .rat. There's 119,- 7
body livin’ in this old shack,” replied oneof his '
companions. » . . ‘ 3 _
.-“It’s somebody that’s hidin' there,” said the’
bandit leader.  , ' - .
“Maybe it’s one of the band.” ' - .
“And maybe it's some spy who’ll carry the news
of our whereabouts to. the sogers.” - " 1
“Then we’d better go up and see who it is. We
can’t afford to take chances. Hangin’ isywhat we
may count on if we’re caught.” , _ ‘
,“I’m a-goin’ up,” said Hamlin, moving toward»
the ladder. c »  3,

“What’s the matter?” asked Bob. ' , 2» -

“And, what’s worse, they're coming up here.”

‘  Tom spoke Bob heard the ladder shake un-

, ller the weight of Hamlin. -

. “We'll give them a warm reception, then,” mut-
tered Bob, drawing his revolver.

i A moment later the ruﬂian stuck his head up

Into‘ the loft. The moonlight, shining through a

dozen holes in the roof, made the place very bright

-so that the bandit had no diﬁiculty in seeing all

, that was up there. He uttered an imprecation

r», “ when his gaze rested -on the two boys, whom he

 immediately recognized. Forgetting perhaps, or

 

" at least disregarding the fact, that the boys were

’ tinned, he sprang into the loft.

" _ “Surrender, you young impel” he cried, draw-

. ‘lug his revolver with his left hand, for his right

arm was bound zip and somewhat out of business.

Tom’s reply was a shot from his revolver. The

" bullet passed through Ha-mlin’s chest, and he fell
a with a hoarse cry. . ~

_ .“Get hold of his revolver, Bob. There are two
~ others below who are likely to give us a lot of
v, trouble," said Tom.

V, One of the other rascals was in the act of fol-
lowing Hamlin u the ladder whenthe shot ran
 and the ban it's fall shook the rickety buil -

 He stopped and looked at‘ his companion.

“Whoever is up there has shot Dave,” he said.
'_ ,, “Then w _ l go _up and avenge him," replied the

iotlier, drawing his gun. ., «
' . “'l‘hey’ll have the drop on one of us before we
‘kin get into -theloft,” said his associate, pausing
irresolutely half way up the ladder. _
~ « “Bah! Let me lead the way” if you're afraid,”
, sneered the other rufﬁan. «
, Bob, peering down through a crack in the ﬂoor,
‘decided. that the speaker looked pretty danger-
ous, so he slioved the muzzle of his revolver
f\'th!‘0ugh the opening and ﬁred at him. The ball
struck him on his pistol arm, and his weapon fell
to the ﬂoor. With a cry of agony he sprang for
the door and disappeared into the night. The
i brother bandit, left alone to face the trouble, de-
V cided that discretion was the better part of valor,
~ . and, jumping‘ from the ladder, made for the door.
Tom ﬁred at his legs. The fellow uttered a howl
« and went limping off, which showed that he had
.  receivedsome kind of a. wound, even if it was
’  only a ﬂesh one.

‘,‘We’ve licked them,” said Bob triumphantly.

“I wonder if the fellow you shot is dead. He's
been lying mighty quiet."
’ The boys examined the ruﬂian leader and found
« (he was not dead. He seemed to be badly wound-
. ed, though.

 “What willwe do with him?” .

5,.‘ “Drag him downstairs and leave him, and then
‘we'll get back to the boat,’ for I" don't think it's
‘safe to stay in this house any longer.”

After nearly two weeks of tough labor at the
« oars they reached the town of Rawlings, on the
line of the Southern Paciﬁc railroad, about ten
miles north of‘ the Mexican border line.

, Tom hastened to ‘arrange for the transfer of the
‘gold ore to the nearest smelter. _

‘V ‘Receiving a receipt for the ore, they at once
teoh,,a‘ train north for the district where Bob’:
father was in charge of extensive‘-mining opera-

After reading John Boland’s autobiography,’ he
decided that Claim No. 7 was worth investigating;
_Taking the boys with him, he paid a visit.to the
mine, and he’ soon assured himself that the lost
lode was really where the dead prospector had
located it. — _ .  .. . =
“You boys have got a fortune here,” he said.»
“I will see that it is secured to you by authority of
the Mexican government, and then I would "ad-5
vise you to _sell out the mine to persons able to-.
work it. I will make it my business to get you a
fair price for it.” « » 5 * v .
_ ‘‘All right, Mr. Gillette, we'll leave the matter
in your hands,” replied Tom. , «
On their way back East they stopped over at
St. Louis and called on Mr. Ardsley’ and Dora.
Mr. Ardsley acknowle ed the gratitude“ 11:6
felt to them for helping ‘in and Dora ‘out. bf
their terrible position, and assured them that they
would always be welcome visitors at his.,_hom‘e
The boys remained for several days as guestsj
of the banker, and Tom made good useof
time to make. himself solid with Dora. ’  .
Tom and Bob received nearly $10,000 each 
of the gold ore they had so laboriously rowedqupg
the Santa Cruz River.‘ _ ~ %'
Later on their rights in Claim No. 7 were dis‘-;
posed of by Mr. Gilletteto -a coupleof Mexican;
capitalists for a handsome royalty on the output
of- the mine. , 
When. this royalty had panned out $50,000,,,tlia‘~
capitalists offered to buy the mine dutright ‘for
three-quarters of a million, and their offer 
accepted.  "
Thus both Tom and Bob became -rich ’boys,fanc_l;
when the former offered his ‘heart and hand
Dora Ardsley he was accepted by both 'the'gi;:[
and her father. 1 . 
In due time they were married, and Tom went
into business with Bob in New York. “ v — ~»_.

“All right,” and promptly the next morniig 
the reporter and the broker were out on W‘ ‘ 
Street, at the corner of Broad, looking for the '
bootblack. - ‘ ' \ '
The broker pointed out the boy to the reporter‘ _
and told him of the war that was being madeonf ’ 
him by the other boys, who had pre-empted 7.  A
the Wall Street section. _ 
“Oh, I’ve' seen that sort of thing many a time " ~ '

 

‘.‘Well, you wait. I’ve seen somthing like it  V V

what different. You will ﬁnd that the newcomer

is a splendid tactician.” ~’ " ‘ r T
The reporter caught the boy’s eye and  "

He walked briskly across the street, but avoid?”

“Gimme 9. shine,” said the reporter, and he ' 
and the broker stood there talking while the boy, V. L

Finally the re orter said: 
f‘See here, cul y, I’ve been down here manya.
time, but never got ontoyou before. You are! «;
newcomer, are you not?” V 
“Yes, sir. Just dropped down this way a few}:
days ago.” ‘ _ 9 i
“All right. How do you ﬁnd business?" _
“Pretty good, so far, sir,” and he ‘went on ;
polishing without looking up. . t‘ 5
“What’s your name?” ‘

' “Bob, sir.’ ~ , _‘ — 
“Bobsir,” the reporter repeated. “That's gr
Don't think I ever heard it before.

 
    
     
     
         
     
        
  
        
    
    
  

queer name.
Bobsir; how do you spell it?”
“B—o—b, Bob.” _ . K ,
“Well, that is. only halfeof it. I understood you .
to say Bobsir.”  e
The bootblack looked up at him with rather an’  .
amused expression on his face and said: ‘

. “That’s all right, sir, you are kiddin’ me. But *
you can’t hoodoo me, sir,” and as he ﬁnished the 
remark he tapped his shoe and held up his hand”
for the expected nickel‘. ' I‘
The reporter dropped it into his hand with th
remark: ‘ 4 i
“Doii’t you make any discrimination in your ;
charges?” / , . _
“N o, sir. It is a nickel for every shine. Three» 
cents for one shoe and a nickel ‘for both.”
“All right. That’s quite a difference. It gives
a one—legged man a show.” ‘ 
, To keep him on hand so as to get a chance to ‘V
witness the opening of the war the broker asked 
for a shine himself. ‘ 
The boy had scarcely gotten a start whens‘
bootblack. came ﬂying down the street with this
box swinging by the strap, and it struck ‘him’ on
the hip a tremendous whack. . ‘ l l
The next instant he», sprang to his feet and
yanked .the box from" under the broker’s foot,
saying: . » ; _
“Excuse me, sir,” and he dashed off in pursuit.
of his ﬂeeing assailant. ' I‘ - l '
The latter heard him coming, and fearing ‘_
jury, he looked back to measure the distan, 7 lie-
fgween them,» and the next nionient he ‘

tea. la pros? and wen down on the 8

to ﬁni the job on the broker's shoes.
J “Did you catch him?” the broker asked.
,~ “No, sir. I hoodooed him, and he butted against
the lamppost, and I guess they’ll have to send
; him home in Q pushcart.” '
The reporter and broker saw a crowd quickly
, gather at the lampost on the corner below. »
' ; ,The, lad had fallen unconscious and was bleed-
-, ing freely from a wound on the side of his head.
'1; , HA policeman summoned an ambulance to take
‘ = him to the hospital.‘ . -
 The other bootblacks who were looking on were

 

   
   
  

-9 ofthem went to'the officer and told him that a
'*bo_otb1ack had knocked the boy down with his
,—blacking-box. * ’ 1 - A
"E. -‘A. man ‘in the crowd who. had witnessed the ac-

 

cident seized him by the coat collar, gavehim a. _

 .‘fWell, the other fellow ‘was chasin’ him.” ' » ?
' .:,‘‘That's all right.’ But he never touched him.
.The first thing you know you'll have the sheriff
 chasingyou, for a boy who will tell such a yarn
as thatis bound to butt up against -something
worsevthan a lamppost some day.” - -
 On seeing their companion taken to the hospital
:in'an ambulance, the bootblacks became some-
' Iwhat demorilized. _ ' -
'9 _rThose‘ who didn’t see the accident ﬁrmly be-
, lieved that the newcomer nearly killed him, where-
is he hadn’t touched him. The newcomer himself,
.though,,was considerably hurt, and when he arose
’ ' in his job he was noticed to limp. ’ '
op . “See here, Bob,” said the reporter, “that was
 a pretty hard hlow you got.” '
_ ‘_ " “Yes, sir. But he got a harder one.”
 2 ' ."Well, that doesn't do you any good, for you
‘ ;.didn't give it to him.” ‘ ’ ‘
‘ Bob winked at him and remarked:

‘Neither the reporter nor the broker had any

V,   ‘usairing a Mail Car '

it  I «It was.on a Virginia road.
, — . When we stopped for the “snack” at Millford,
 Captain Darracott told me he had three suspi-
cious-looking passengers in the forward car.‘
.’They would not come into the hotel. to partake
_uf.the lunch, though he had invited them to do ‘so.
. The conductor was so much interested in get-‘
«ting the passengers to partake of the lunch, that I
;'|f'jiad several times jokingly insisted that he shared
the proﬁts with the seedy Virginian who kept the
hotelzi and the snack was the burden of the busi-
ness ‘done by the house. ‘ " i .'
f 5"D_arracott was. very social, and I am sure this
pwasjthe extent of his interest in the collision. ‘
i_i‘."‘=TIiere is no law that compels them to be so-
rial,” I replied. ’ ’ ‘
 I",“I ’saw.them'looking over the mail andbaggage
car before the train started,” added the captain.
".f‘ROSSlb1Y to see that their baggage was‘ on
I lioardl.’ I added,‘and’I was sometimes‘ inclined to
tgase him. . g ’ , . ., ‘ ’ ‘
e ’, A passenger inyited him to visit the bar for the
‘ sociability “of , the. thing, and nothing more was
said ab__out.the three men, but I” had curiosity
'fe1;ong_h‘ to pass ‘through the forward car and take
axlook, at them. , - so _
~ They ‘ were well-dressed gentlemen, though
.._rather swellish ‘in’ their garb. A .,
 »As I passed through the car, they seeme.d to be
‘very’ busylwith their newspapers. though I am
"confident they were engaged in conversation when
I opened the door.“ _ _» .
 '5 . I went to the machine, passing through the bag-
gage car, half 'of which was used for the mails.
 We called it the mail car as often as the bag-
gage car. »
I »It was not a postal car; and the mail sacks
were simply locked into a room partitioned off
«from the rest of the car for the purpose.
 At this/time we had brakespon the passenger
‘'cars, but none on the mail car. _
. ,;'The Wooden couplers, or shackles,_were stiIl_in
,'_e:l—and I have no doubt they saved many lives
;'and much property when accidents occurred.
‘ ~Darracott rang the big bell on the forward car,

cow ran onthe track in front of theengine. . .
