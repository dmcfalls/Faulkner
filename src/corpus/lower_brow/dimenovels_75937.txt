CHAPTER I.—The Boy ,From the Nbrth.

“That is my ultimatum, nephew,” said Mat-

j :th'eW Crosby. the factory owner, to his only rela-
{, tive, Frank Scott, one morning at the breakfast
table. “You will stop your interference at the
_;factory or pack your trunk and leave my house
“ and my employ.”

    

    
 
  
 

 

 lboking bov who sat opposite.
' , “I want no buts," replied the elderly man, tes-
'vtily’.. “I brought you down hereto learn the
business so that you might rise to become my
,superintendent and eventually, in the course of
‘human events, succeed to my property. I con-
sidered that my duty toward you, for you are
;the son of my only sister, and my logical heir;
“’,'bui:, sir, if you are going to demoralize my fac-
‘my by injecting philanthropic and socialistic
ideas into the business, the sooner you quit the
V “better. I won’t have it, and that’s all there, is

~ about it.”

- Thus speaking, Mr. Crosby rose from the table
‘and walked to the window overlooking his ﬁne
and extensive grounds and the country beyond.
The village, lar lyxinhabited by a magic who
.worked, though s aved would be the wor ,' in the
cotton factory on its suburbs, was in partial evi-
. dance through the trees. The factory itself, large
as it was, ould not be seen.
a hollow, to begin with, and the rest of its ample
 roportions, including the chimney, was hidden
- ya‘ handsome spired church, which stood between
fiche Crosby mansion and the village.

._ This religious‘ ediﬁce was much superior to its
surroundings.  "
" 7-Few country. Lamlets of the size of Cottonville
. could‘! boast of such a splendid clerical structure.
1 Mr; Crosby had built it at his own expense, and
ﬁheact was considered by his’ better-class nei h-

are as one of mare and healthy piety, and t e
re vutation he thus acquired had been of great
vantage to him in a worldly way.v It wasn't
£47? ‘ however, that induced him’ to erect the
uilcling. ‘He couldn’t bear to see the “infernal
l factory,” as he called it to himself, from his win-

b ,  was’ wrung, froin the life-'7

blood of his operatives, children particularly. ‘ A
great many children worked for him and every
one bore the unmistakable stamp of the factory. .
There seemed to be no lack of children in Cotton- 1
ville to supply the needs of the Crosby interest, . ' ''
though the cemetery on the slope of a grass-cov-
cred hill received a large annual tribute. The ,
standard factorv wage was hardly -suﬂicient to. ’ -'
keep the adult operatives in food and raiment,
therefore the parents set their offspring to work ’ 
as soon as they were old and strong enough to
become useful at the business.

,The Crosby factory was a kind of modern
Juggernaut. It ground hope, ambition and even ‘
life itself out of those attached‘to it. Yet it was", ’
not greatly different from the scores of similar
factories in the Sunny South. The conditions —  ._
of most of thesefactories, with respect to child :5 .,
industry, was disgraceful, but no concerted ef- .,
fort was made by philanthropists to improve, 2.;
them. ‘ , :_ ‘

When Frank Scott, at his uncle's invitation, , ,
cameto Cottonville to enter his relative’s service, , _
he had no idea of the state of things in a cotton 
factory. He was ex cted to fall into the usual 
routine anl make 11 s we. upward. without the , 
personal ‘experience that ell to outsiders; T '

As the boss’ nephew, the tyrannical for-emenw _
or Overseers did not dare treat him otherwise r
than with consideration, for all judged that he
would eventually become the boss himself. This
did not prevent him from making a close obsei- l *
vation of the cruelties practiced on the younger '
operatives, and the hardships of the general rank
and ﬁle. - ’ ~ ~

Frank had a kind heart, and so much feeling
for others that the scenes he was a daily witness
of jarred upon him. He soon began to show 7
his sympathy in various ways that won for  
the grateful appreciation of the hands, yo ‘ V
and old. It also called down on him the criliia 

 

   
   
  
  
  
 
  

a respectful call-down from the superintendent. .'
Frank’s little deeds of kindness could notbe
squelched, and he defended his conduct ‘with so»;
much vigor that the superintendent ﬁnally f,elt»—
constrained to report the matter to Mr. Crosby. _.
The manufacturer gave his nephew a stralghtr
own. ., 

For a‘, while Frank mo erated his acts of_good-

‘ﬂbroke out again, interfering bet een a foreman
and a poor boy named Billy unker, who had
been reduced" to a pitiable wreck through lack
.of nourishing food and a constant succession of
inhuman beatings.‘ ”
The incident in question occurred on the after-
noon previous. Billy. faint from semi—starvation
‘ and ceaseless labor, had spoiled a piece of'_work
‘ . and the foreman proceededto knock the dayhghts

to speakhis in-in
glowing morning, when our story opens, and by’
.—that time’ a part of his ra e-had evaporated.
Nevertheless, he handled the oy without gloves

«himselfvigorously on humane grounds, but hu-
"m'anity played but a small ﬁgure with the fac-

 

ltory owner, and. be continually cut the lad’s words-_

turned all the shafting of the room ~camev'1ip.
through the ﬂoor. A disconnecting rod descended.
from the ceiling, and without knowing whathad
happened, but fearing that one of’ the girls" had‘
been caught in the machinery, he sprang for.-
ward, ‘seized the‘ rod and threw.the driving belt,
on to the loose pulley. In a moment the main-
shaft ceased to revolve, which stopped all the‘
small ‘driving pulleys .Ll1 over the room, and the
humming machinery stopped short. Frank then
ran where the crowd was gathering and saw that
the ﬂowing hair of the prettiest girl in the fac-
tory, Bertha Long, had been caught in the belt-’
ms: and she lad been drawn up to the shafting,..
where she hunggpale and terriﬁed, half supported’
by one hand with which she had mechanically
seized a pulley. . 3  
Only Frank’s prompt action had saved her 1

incidentally her life. Frank -helped to‘ take th_e-
srirl down from her dangerous and uncomf.orta~b'lé
position, and she was permitted to go into the
dressin r-rooin to recover her self-possession‘
Several of the hands had seen Frank’s quic
action in stopping the machinery and in a ver _‘
short time what he had done was known all
through the room. ' 7 
One of the girls told Bertha, and sheth
realized how much she was indebted to the brig tf
Northern boy, who‘ had already made himself .'
prime favorite in the factory. . When she’-re;
turned to her machine, Frank went up to her?
and asked her how she felt. . i - ._g

she answered. with a smile. “I wish to than

' CHAPTER’ II.—Billy Bunker.

As Frank was on his way to his uncle’s mansion,
after work was over for the ‘day, his attention; ,
was attracted by a succession of shouts among-
the trees near the church, and the sounds of .p1i '
suit. He -had gone but a few yards when /ma‘ -
ged and wretched-looking boy came running_7o§6..
into, the open, hotly followed ‘by three men.'con '
nected with the factory. vFrank recognized ..tl3_;'é

“He’ll ne_ver have the satisfaction of venting, '

But that was wherehe made a mistake. Next 
morniilg they took a’ train for the West. They"
were bound for the new diggings in southwestern
Nevada. Everybody to-day is more or less fa--
miliar, with the Goldﬁeldand adjacent districts
which have madejnany a poor man rich, and
rich men richer. The town of Goldﬁeld to—day"
is. a rushing mining "metropolis in .a graveyard 2 ;_.
of deadvolcanoes. It has 9/population of over, f
10,000, and all modern improvements, including,‘ 
railroad connection, telephones and electric"
lights; It has three-stor stone buildings on its ._
street corners, housing er several banks, and.
the stores haveshowy plate glass fronts.

There is also a system of powerful autoniobile W ,_:;
stages, scooting the desert roads like wi'ng’edW'_’
monsters to give quick transport to distant out- ,
lyingjcamps, with which it is connected. by a -‘
network of telephone-and telegraph wires." ‘ . ,7. .
’_: And all this has happened within a eriod‘ of .’ l 
less than six years, though. the‘ first ‘rush" to._,_,:
Goldﬁeld .took ‘place-. two years before the town _ ' '
may besaid to have had its birth.. It was ‘not, , 
the Goldﬁeld of to-day that'Frank Scott and "
«Billy Bunker were journeying towai-_d. It: was
the undeveloped Goldﬁeld of 1903 they were mak- ,
ihg for. The astounding riches of that section,

.of.~ Nevada did not get themselves fully discov- .
‘ered till there had ‘been threesuccessive “rushes_”_
to the ‘region. — ~ - .
i What then induced Frank to_.start for» that-,
desert ﬁeld of action? The following factswhich"
he read in 'a newspaper justbefore hisuncle
wrote and asked himto come to Cottonville, arid.
his boyish enthusiasm pictured the wild region of.
southwestern Nevada as a new Eldorado, where-'
gold was to be had for" the picking. ' 0 g,

In the fall of 1902 two Nevada-born young"
men, familiar with mining and fortiﬁed by ex-‘
perience against the dangers of the desert, found.
themselves “busted”=in thegmining camp of «Tend-_
pah. Thev had failed“to get their hooks into‘
any good thing in that great camp ,whichwthei'”

limited means would. enable them to pull dowh,
and they decided to strike their -acquaintances
for a grub stake and hit the trail on a prospect-
ing‘ tour. ‘I - 1 -' '
~ They started out, and when they reached~Co-.
lumbia Mountain they found it covered with ﬂoat,
uartz, some of which—a.. black-looking rock—.-
t ey panned and found it exceedingly rich.-in‘
gold. With plenty of grub and water closh at -
hand they determined to prospect forthe, l¢dgé{
from which the rich’ ﬂoat came. In a «few fdays
they discovered it. ‘
. It was twenty feet across a good p

of a few others did-..the work and ,perfected;..'the

Hundreds went to the new district, staked’
claims as close as they could get_to Columbia
Mountain’ and—returned home; that is, the ma-
jority did. The reason was that in those, days

 it cost more than $60 a ton to mine and ship
and smelt the ores of the desert camps, and
nothing under that cost could -be handled.

Such was the condition of things when Frank
land‘ Billy reached Tononah after a tough and
«. arduous journey from the nearest railroad point.

They put up at a rude hotel and Frank began

. making inquiries about Columbia Mountain right
away, ' «

 ' V “So you are thinkin’ of goin’ out thar, are you?”

 grinned ‘, a rough—1ooking. guest when Frank

» ' broached the subject to him after supper as they

 sat in front of the hotel.

 .“Yes, sir; that's what brought us out h

:‘,‘Come from the East, I s’pose?”.

“Yes, by way of the South.”

v “Well, there seems to’ be fortunes awaiting
those who get on the ground.J_i,’

‘ “Jest so. I’ve just come from there and I’m

; = “Busted!” ejaculated Frank, gazing at him in

colored stories he had read, not a ton of ore

had as yet been shipped from Goldﬁeld. He reg-
tired. early to bed not a little discouraged by
what he had learned. ,

The new Eldorado seemed to have been over» ‘-we
estimated. He had come -here expecting that.‘ ye
both he and Billy would make their fortunes in. 1
no time at all, and the ﬁrst thing he had met .V; .f
was disappointment. A good night’s rest putmi ‘
him in a more cheerful frame of mind, and he . “‘
and Billy went to breakfast‘ with excellent appe-V , 1-,
tites. After the meal Frank buttonholed the land- ~ ~ ‘
lord and asked him about things at Goldﬁeld. .
hoping that he would contradict a good ’de »
that the stranger of the evening before had.told.~’ .
him. The land’ord told him about the strike’ »4
made by Stimler and Marsh at Columbia Moun- *
tain which, when reported at the camp here, had_
started the ﬁrst rush; but he corroborated the" ;
stranger’s statement that most of the, gold-'seek-‘ .3
ers had returned, disappointed with the results’ ?
they had met with. , '

“I thought ore that assayed $50 a ton w
good?” said Frank-. . , “ ‘

‘‘So it.» is, but if it’s going to cost $50 or more
to get it out of the ground and carry it to the
smelter, and pay the charges at the latter place,
where is the profit?” ' . _  

“Why don't somebody put up a smelteron the
ground?” - ’ .

“Because there ain’t prospect of enough husi
ness yet to make one pay. Recollect, these new
diggings are out inthe desert and it would cost«

a pile of money to haul machinery and lumber
and other things there.” i »’ i ' " "

had to be done according to a certain rule’ in
order to secure a valid title to the claimant, _
after which they could do as much more work
as they chose. , .

He told them how many claims the two’ of
them could take up, but that the location work
must be performed correctly on each claim, with-
in the time limit, to hold it. If after establish-
ing a clear title to as many claims as the law
allowed them, they chose to abandon them tem-
porarily, they could do so without fear of losing
them in case fresh discoveries in the neighbor-
hood brought on another rush.

He explained that they would be entitled to
deeds of the property as soon as they were able
to put in a valid claim. and that, at their re-
quest, the papers would be ﬁled for record at .
the county recorder’s oﬂice. That would prove
their unquestioned ownership. Billy was an at-
tentive listener, while Frank absorbed the in-
formation generously furnished by the hotel man.
He was not able to grasp matters the way Frank
did, but liexwas just as interested. He did not »
think about making his own fortune, but to help
Frank make his. ‘ ' .

He intended to work like a beaver for his ,
friend——thc boy who had rescued him from the 
slavery of the cotton factory, and saved him
from the savage treatment meted out unsparingly
to him by the brute Moss. I ’ ' ’

During the few days that the boys remained ._‘
at Tonopah, Frank made use of every opporv ’
tunity to pick up information about the mining‘
business. . ‘ . ;

He had funds sufficient to purchase the neces- ,f
sary outﬁt for himself and his companion, which
included a couple of good burros. Their food

 

slung across the haunches of the animals at the 
back of the saddles. For protection they bought 
adcouple of revolvers, with a supply of cart-, 
ri ges. . » _
By Sunday, which was a sort of holiday in . ’_' 
Tonopah, they were ready to start out, but as the‘
wagon train wasn’t going till the next day they -3,
put in the time resting against the hard 'o.ur—- ¥
new that lay before them. After dinner rank
and Billv started‘ out for a short stroll up the
main streetof the camp. The miners and otser
workers who had slept late after a rollicking Sat: ‘
urday night at the saloons, where drinking, smok- ; . 1

'ing and card playing were the chief’ means of

diversion, were now making their appearance in
clean shirts and their best apparel, gravitating »
back to the same saloonsto put in the afternoon ' 
and evening in the same fashion. ' 
The stage, which arrived the evening before, 
had brought in several strangers but none of _
these had’ put up at the hotel where the boys, ;
stopped, having been captured by the rival house i '
further up the street. , , 4‘ 
. One of these newcomers came out of his.ho'tel ‘
Just as the boys came abreast of the building. A ’—
“Oh, gracious!” gasped Billy, grabbing his com-,v.. —~
panion by the arm. * ' V»
“What’s tli; matter, Billy?” asked Frank.
“He's here.” ‘ ' ,
“Wh'o’s here?” ‘
“The foreman—-Jim Moss!" ' , : ,
~“Here‘-—you’re dreaming.’ ’ ~ 
“Look there!" and Bil y  at

why should he shake it to come West?

' to be his twin brother, but I guess it’s only a
~ ' ‘remarkable case of resemblance,” said Frank.
‘ “No, it’s him,” persisted the other lad.
At that moment the man looked directlyat

astonislirsiént and a muttered imprecation. Then
- he started forward and confronted the boys.

another talk with “Uncle” Charley before they
‘~ started out, and he gave them some valuable
3 advice. That afternoon they inspected a part of
“the district close to the claims that were being
i worked,‘ and ‘Frank picked out the ground he
‘ thought promised the best.
‘ ‘ At supper he told -Mr. Jackson what‘ they had
done,-an'd the miner ‘said he guessed they couldn’t
have done better. Next day they visited the
fackson prospects and also went over to the mines
.1p.the mountain side. After ‘that. they relocated
.tl*iei.r own claims and began the location work on
‘one of them. Every day when- they got back to‘
the hotel they heard offresh ore discoveries‘ f a
richer character, and the people of the new ig--
, gings — ere more than ever sure that they had
struck areal Eldorado. i i r . .
,l'After they ‘hadpcrfected their title to one
claim, in good shape they began on another.
There’ was a single claim withtwo small houses
an it which jutted into their property. The loca-
tion_work,was done on this ground, but, never-
theless, ithad been abandoned, though the‘ title
remained with the «party who had staked it gut.

So Frank returned to themining town with the

CHAPTER X.——Kicked into Good Fortune‘.

It was like a terrible nightmare to Frank, that 
desperate ride, and he never forgot it as iong‘ as, ’
he lived. Everytime the coach lurchcd ‘toward,
one of the voids‘ he thought their doomwas ‘at
hand, and his blood ran cold as he sometimesvfelt ‘
himself hanging over the edge of a crevice, whose _
depth he could not conceive of. But there is an 1
end of everything, and thevbottom of the ‘deﬁle?
was reached without accident; As the coachswung,
around the last ‘turn Frank's foot was throw oﬂ’
the brake and he had toclutch the seat to" [live
himself. Again he fancied their last hour was

 

1 come when the vehicle, with two wheels off the:

ground, whirled around a big rock at accelerated '
speed, then dashed -out on level ground and across,
the ‘silent desert like a meteor express. ' 

“Saved!” ‘muttered the boy to himself. ,

He would havebraked up and stopped thefbuure

.1-os now only he knew their pursuers were coming

on behind. The moonlight enabled him to see for
a considerable distance before and behind and on
both sides. It wasnitylong before he saw thetwtr

‘rascals-dash out into the open and cut after the ‘

stage at the best pace their animals were~capab!e
of. A stern chase is usually along one, all things
being nearly equal, and so the scoundrelsiéuined

got tired of running they would ease up of their °

‘own accord. The dragging of the wheels in the
' sand soon had that effect on them, and then the
pursuers came up, hand over hand, with shouts

, . of satisfaction.
f:;.. “ “They're bound to catch us soon,” thought
‘ Frank, “and being two to one they’ll do me up.”
As he turned again to note the rapidly de-

creasing distance between the coach andthe ,

" scoundrels, the g-lint of the moonlight on the
_ barrel of the driver’s riﬂe, strapped on the top
' ,,of the vehicle, caught his eye.

. “By. George! I forgot about that gun. That
will stand those chaps oif in great shape,” he
breathed, excitedly. ‘ ’
i . - Tying the reins to the driver’s right arm, he
; “unbuckled the riﬂe, which was of the magazine
‘ pattern, and taking aim at the leading burro be-

hind, across the roof of the coach, he pulled the

.trio*o'er. A sharp crack and a puff of smoke blew

away. Simultaneously theburro fell like a stone
" in its tracks, pitching its rider over his head. With
a ﬁerce iniprecation the second rider began blaz-
ing away with his revolver, and some of the
V‘ bullets came unpleasantly close to Frank's head,
. . though he crouched down ‘as well as he could.
‘i’, "After expending ﬁve shots the rascal reined in

and rode back to his companion and Frank

‘  rjeined the burros to their customary pace and then
turned his attention to the driver. He pulled
aﬂask of whisky out of the man’s pocket and
* poured some of its contents down his throat. That

i ‘:‘What happened?” he asked, in a dazed way.
.0 “Take another drink,” said Frank. -
' The driver did so, and in a few moments pulled
himself together. ' .
 . “Why we’re out of the deﬁle,” he said. “How

“Yes, you had a narrow escape. I. wonder who‘ ‘

“I haven’t any idea who they were,” replied
Dan. “This is the first time I was ever held up
on this route, and I'm blamed glad to say that it
didn’t work. As soon as I notify the county
sheriff he’ll take a posse and go after them chaps.
As there’s a lot of traffic these day across this
section of the desert we can’t afford to have such
goings on.» The best way to discourage them is
to hang the rascals at the start as an example
to others who might be inclined to imitate them!”
They rode forward all night, and shortly after
sunrise reached To-nopah. Frank dropped oif-at‘
the hotel, and was the first to circulate the story’
of the exciting‘-ride down the deﬁle of the ridge,
and their escape from the two disguised rascals
who tried to hold the stage up. Jared Cooke and
a crowd of interested miners listened to him. They
all declared that he had saved the coach, not only
from spoliation by the two rascals, but from
wreck in the deﬁle, and praised his nerve under
strenuous conditions. . In the meantime,, Dan
Burns, the driver, delivered the mail bag atthe
post-office and the box of nuggets’ at the bahlﬂ
He also carried the bags of s ecimens to. the
assay office. At each of these . aces he related}

had seen a IGSSOIII in the second rush. All of
’ these who could do so either relocated their old
claims or staked new -ones and guarded their
’  _ titles. They had reason to rejoice for this later.
' Fall was now on and Frank and Billy, who felt
they were no longer tenderfoots, began work in
- earnest on the ’c_laim purchased by the former.
  As Billy had no interest in this property, Frank
‘ agreed to credit him with a percentage of the
_ gold they took out. They worked steadily from
 early morn until darkness came on, but though
they went deeper and deeper_into the gmllnd

’ . . every day,’ nothing came of their labor.

At a certain level they imitated the method v

r ’ pursued on other claims and started a tunnel ‘oil’
J... the-shaft. Frank was in hopes of hitting the rich
’ ledge which ran clear through the Jumbo, or at

. least» was supposed to run through that promising
claim. He had named this property the Round
Top, from the circumstances that the ground rose

' ’ toward the center into a small, circular plateau
 of rock. Although the boys. worked like beavers,
/ ,; with occasional help from outside miners, they

made no discoveries. By the middle of December.

’ they’ had pushed-the tunnel 100 feet without any
satisfactory result whatever.
, Frank looked for did not pass through ‘the prop-
,.  perty, or they were working above _It, _01' n0l'r 1“
 the right direction. It was disappointing when
3. , all the mines of any promise in their neighbor-
 ’ hood were panning out better and better every
2 week. At length the ﬁrst of the new year dawned
‘and they had been six months in the Columbia
' Mountain ‘district. They had greatly improved
in health and strength, but not in _worldly wealth.
. _ “I guess I wasn’t born lucky, Bill,” _Frapk said
_ one day when they knocked off "for dinner. .‘I£
- I had been, this claim would be a second Combina-
‘ tion or Jumbo -by this time. As it is, we are
.. Sjustihanging on by our teeth. I have hardly a
cent left. It is fortunate Uncle Charley insists
. on giving me unlimited credit. If we had to pay
spot cash for our meals we'd have to quit or
,. pass the hat around among our acquaintances.”
"  “Oh, we’ll come out all right by and by,” said
¥Billy cheerfully. ' _ .
. ., “I hope so, but things don’t look that way at
present. My last letter to Bertha was not very
~optimistic,‘but I told her we intended to hang
' on somehow.” . 7 —
“Of course'we’ll hang on. Wasn’t you offered
. three times asmuch for this claim as _ou gave for
1 ‘it inspite of the fact that we haven tturned up
anythin’? ’ Then there were two men here who
i‘ wanted to lease it from you. Uncle Charley ad-
' vised you to take them up. He said that the
" way we are workin’ it we were ‘losin’ out time
to no. purpose. I heard that the January claim
has been leased, and that is known to be a corkin’
good one.” ,
' Uncle Charley had explained to Frank that the

property not, indeed,‘ systematically developed, but
,——thorouéhly prospected, without expense to him-
self, and with all the chances of a ‘fair proﬁt be-

the sounds of labor were hushed. ‘The miners,
were ‘enjoying themselves in the saloons and~in
divers other ways around the main street of ‘they
now growing town of Goldﬁeld. The explosion

noon it startled a good part of the place. Score

., » a l.\'s of property, but who t.hat person was no
one could guess. Small parties of the miners
started off to investigate, as they had nothing

, else on their hands. In twos and threes they

 neared the Round Top claim.» Everybody knew

i ' there were two shacks on this property. One of
, these was now a wreck on the ground, while the

other had disappeared utterly, leaving in its
place a great gaping hole in the rock and earth.

 

Sticking out of a thick clump of bushes were a,

pair of legs. The legs hung limp and motionless
,«‘as if they had ceased to interest their owner. The
 , first ‘two miners on the ground pulled the legs,

‘V ,_ with their attached body, out of the bushes and

v . recognized Frank Scott, the owner of the claim,
 apparently dead. His clothes were badly torn

J and he looked like a wreck. ‘ , '

,, ..»_“He’s done for,-:poor chap!” said one of the
—-,‘miners.' ~" -- : '

 ‘;' feeling about the boy’s»heart.' ‘

_' “Yes, and very much alive, too, from the beat

“_.Here’_s my whisky ﬂask. Pour some down his
.,1thrcat_ and see if it will revive him, and then
- we‘.. carry him up to, the doctor's.” ’

   The whisky brought Frank to,.'his senses with
 _ .- avrush.» He ‘sat up without any assistance.

*  “—.What's happened?” he asked in a dazed way.
~'  J , “Don’t you know?” asked one of the miners.
  “No; seems to me_ there wasan explosion some-

*  I.re_member. Oh, goodness‘? vI~ do'n’t see it at all,

= excitement. ‘

' cried, anxiously. “Are you badly hurt?”

. “No, I'm not badly hurt as far as I can see,”
replied his pard. “But look at our shacks‘. They

CHAPTER XII.——Leasing His cum...-a,
Frank purchased new tools in the morning and

hours w en two men came to the claim and told

company so as to get capital necessary to .develop‘ — “
the mineproperly. , « ' 
“You’re only wasting your time, young man,”
said ﬁne of the men, “working the way, you are
doing. You and your pard can only make very
little progress getting -out the are you have in
sight. The right thing to do is to ei,ther’fon'n

for ‘three or four months to responsible. persons.
If you are Willing to make a. lease we wouldlike
the first chance to bid on it. - You are bound to
have a number of offers, and it will be up to you
to take upwith the proposition that suits you 
We are practical mining men, and I can referyou

, The boys uncovered quite a bit of the ledge that
' day, taking specimens from different places, all
‘ of which seemed about the same’ to their unprac-
ticed eyes. They dug across the ledge, not in the
_ _ direction it ran, in order to ﬁnd out its width at
  that point. Frank labored in one direction. -while

- Frank stayed several days in Tonopah, and
,'while there was regarded with considerable inter-
‘est. Jared Cooke congratulated him on his luck
and said it was rather a surprise to him that
;they,' without any knowledge of mining whatever,
had come out at the top of the heap. He was
waited on .by two parties who wanted to make
easing arrangements with him as soon as they
ad inspected his claim. He told them they were
, welcome to look at his property and put in their
:-,bid., Both men intended to form a company to
"furnish the capital to work his claim during the

With Cooke about the leasing business. and the
o,tel- ‘man advised him to go into it, but told him

Billy had uncovered the ledge in threeplaces‘ and ..
that it ran seventeen feet in the original spot, "
fourteen in another and twelve in‘ the third. .  .—
_ "‘There’s been a couple ~of.,bearded fellows hang-I

said Billy. ’ — - . ,

“Strangers are coming here every day,” replied

,Frank, “and a rich strike always attracts_ atten-

tion, particularly whencpeople hear how this

here, but _they acted different,to anybody else.‘ I
took them for suspicious characters. How about
those two chaps who tried to hold up the stage
that time? They were not caught, I s’pose?" .

“No. , The sheriff-and a posse looked for them. 3,

"and looked_up. , _
To his great satisfaction he saw a thin streak
._ mf daylight shooting in near the roof. He
" ‘Jclim ed up with great care in the dark until he
‘ {dreac ed the stones on which he could support his
ylfeet. Then taking out his knife he began work,
‘having seen that the hole opened out into a brush-
icovered deﬁle, with the bright blue sky above.
‘ ~ ‘ In the course of an hour, during which Frank
v Hworked away steadily, he enlarged the openin
" llconsiderably. The position in which he worke
as rather an awkward one, ‘but that could not
, .r e helped. He made the best of it, resting when
" e felt tired and resuming after a short interval.
’  e found one good—sized stone in the way and
 spent another hour or more loosening it so he
 Jcould work it out. .
V - .,When it dropped into thetunnel he found room
,-‘enough to crawl into the hole and rest more at
‘ Tlhis ease. He was feeling very hun y by this
~ ‘time and wondered when Billy wou d show up
with the breakfast from above. Another half
B ,- hour passed before he heard his pard« shouting
 ,rto'him as he came along in the dark.
" The grub consisted of cheese and crackers, with
, g B hunk of canned corned beef. Their drink, two
I whisky ﬂasks full of spring water. When the
Jlght meal was despatched, Billy took the knife,
Jclimbed up’ and continued the cod work which
.,EF‘rank had begun. By noon 1: e hole was big
’ enough for them to squeeze through and they
lost no time in doing so. Frank "stuﬁ"ed up the
‘hole ‘with brush and then they stepped out into
the deﬁle. _ v -
" The question now was how were they to ﬁnd
their way back to the spot where they had been
captured? If they could‘ reach that place the
, acould count on being taken up either by the coac
when it came along or by one of the many teams
‘that now passed that way daily. If they went
in the wrong direction the chances were they
would starve in the wilds of the ridge and their
gbones might not be found for many months.

"oil" up the ravine. Fifteen minutes later, on
‘turning a corner, they saw the entrance to the
cave where the rascals apparently had their head-
vquarters.‘ No one was about on- the outside.

, Frank decided to make the attempt himself.
{tend he did. He found the cave empty. It didn't
ililtake. him long to ﬁnd a supply of provisions. They
‘ﬁlled two empty bottles with water from the
atream outside and then resumed their -way. The
actual distance in a straight line they had, to
travel was not great, and had they known the

BORN LUCK’?

0 while he was arranging forthis a clique of East. :

 

 

But they did not follow the right course and 
consequently three days elapsed before they came
out on the edge of the desert, and then they were ~
miles away from the place they had aimed to. " ‘
reach. _The only thing they could do was to
tramp it along the ridge till, they at length’ _
reached the opening where all vehicles passed ’
between Goldﬁeld and Tonopah.

There was a stream at this point where the
burros were watered. and they got all the water.
they wanted. In the course of a couple of hours
a train appeared, bound for Tonopah, and the
boys took passage on one of e wagons, after _ r
explaining how they came to be in their predica-,
ment. They reached the big mining camp early
next day and received a cordial greeting from _
Jared Cooke, who was astonished at their story, "
The sheriff of the county was at once informed
of the circumstances, and about where the gan
of rascals were likely to be found. He quick y‘
gathered a strong posse and started out to round. 
them up. ‘ - I ,

Two days later he returned with half of the’
rascals, Jim Moss among the number. The ruf- ,
ﬁans were tried and sent to jail for a long period, A” 5
and so Jim Moss got what was coming to him 
at last. In due time Frank and Billy returned
to Goldﬁeld, and during the month made a pretty,"
good_ ﬁnd in Billy's claim. Billy succeeded‘ ‘in ‘
getting some _moneyed chaps .to lease all his,
ground, and he got a very fair dividend, out of
the lease. Frank was making big mone out
of his claims. for the ore turned out was a.‘ll’highg*
grade and panned out from $150 to $400 a ton. 
When the lease of his mine terminated he was in ', ‘
a good position to form a stock company, but;

 

 

    
 

ern capitalists, after inspecting his property, of-'0
fered him $1,000,000 cash for it. He agreed to 
take it if Billy could find a’ purchaser for hism,
claims. The clique then offered $100,000,for’,,
Billy's property, and the offer was accepted, and
so the double deal was put, through. " - 5
. Hardly were things consummated when Frank‘
received a letter from a lawyer of Cottonville 
informing him that his uncle had justldied and
left him all his property in the place, worth
something over $200,000. ‘ - y 2 ,,

Frank and Billy lost no time in returning to ‘
the Southern town, where Frank took possession '
of his legacy, and Billy went to live with him as-
an independent (young gentleman. In a short "
time Frank aske Bertha to marry him, and her ,
reply was favorable. Six months latershe be-’-' ’

It was while he sat there that Len Marks tips I

“Have a sip of ginger-ale, Walters/’_ he said,
popping the cork. "You need a little something
after doing what you did.” '

Sam took the bottle, not a little surprised, and“_
Marks stepped back. _.:

Our hero was just going to drink the contents

of the bottle when Timlin, who had Ifollewed him /

to the bat, struck out.

No one felt really disappointed at this, for 1

they had done their share that inning. ‘
Harry Bates called Sam, so the boy turned to

the scorer and handed him the bottle of ginger“

ale.
"Drink it; I don’t want it,” he said.
“Thanks!” was the reply,

promptly swallowed the contents. 1 »

Sam had his little talk with the captain, an
stepped over to his position at short-stop. He
had barely got there when there was a commotion" ‘

. One’ of the most striking headlands on the
"South African coast is the bluff of Natal. Its ma-
’ istic position, standing boldly out from the main-
{:nd and rising straight up from the deep, blue
t ; cean to a height of several -hundred feet; the
, ﬁrilliant hues of the thousand-and-one varieties
 of tropical foliage which cover its steep sides

‘from ‘top’ to bottom ;_ the clear sky above and the

bright plumage of the birds ﬂashing in the sun-
 all contribute to make the spot picturesque in the

 )1 rlighthouse now crowns the summit. .The ‘inner
_'_br,[northern side of the bluﬁ"'forms one side of

‘on -the north. The northern coast ‘is irregular,
« ‘ ‘and a’ sandhillprojecting far into the bay almost

GERMAN TOWN TO SPRINKLE STREETS

WITH SODA WATER

4. The City Council of Altheide, Germany, has
voted to use‘ soda water exclusively for ‘street
cleaning purposes. « —

V "Hencefrorth, under the new measure, soda foun-
tains will be hauled through the streets and
plazas with sprinkler attachments.

Altheide’s mineral springs spout 2,000,000
uarts of soda water every day and most of itis
asted. Ordinary water is expensive and it was
decided that soda fountains could do thework
vmore efficiently at lo.wer cost. . '

Country folk living in isolated farm houses‘, 4
along little traveled highways forty or ﬁfty years‘
ago were called upon almost daily by itinerant I
venders. ’ While a few of the less cautious farm-‘ .

such visitations, most of them were satisﬁed that 1
