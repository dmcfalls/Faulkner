Beyond the threshold stood four of the palace guards,

He watched them haughtily until‘ they had /gone; then: ,

dropped his chin upon his breast, and passed ‘silently V
through the doorway and was gone.

“I am‘ of the opinion, Rupert,” replied the detective
slowly, but with emphasis, “that your august brother, the
king, is mad.” And it was with equal solemnity that
Prince Rupert replied, also in a low tone: - i

‘a house that was set back some distance from “the street,‘/ ~

inside. ‘ i l ‘

V bore every appearance of being deserted, or at least
