It 'was,a dressed to Simon Larue at his house,

' picked it up and looked at it again.

_ This was posted this afternoon. I wonder

hardly think so.”

§His curiosity; however, wouldn’t let him rest
 he..pul1ed out the enclosure and looked at it.

out steel girders for the railroad bridge, whic
were intended to replace certain ‘defective ones
that had yielded to the strain put upon the struc-4
ture after the passage of heavy trains for a num-
ber of years. Ralph was employed in the, ma-
chine room of the bridge department. While all

When the whistle blew for the. resumption of

corner he boarded a trolley car which landed him
” ose to his destination. A dozen men were em-
loyed near the pier support on the Canadian side
the river, perhaps two hundred yards from
shore. Thither Ralph made his way, and
singling out McIntosh, reported his arrival. The
oreman on the bridge had already been informed
by telephone that he was coming, and was look-
g for him. He was put to work with a riveting
’$gang employed on a girder that had just been
-(put in place. It was a new sensation for Ralph
to work away up in the air, over the swiftl_ ﬂow-

irder was dropped carefully and exactly into ﬁie
uplicate slots ready to receive the two ends. All

mg ready, the two riders gripping the ends ‘.-

With‘ their hands and legs,/the order was given
mzorhoist away. The wire cable began. to move
“hi-.o h the steel blocks, and the girder rose
,o'wly into the air; At the same time the ap-

The chief recreation Ralph had indulged »_in'
since he came to that locality was a row on th
river. ‘Whenever the ‘night was ﬁne he got the’;
rowboat used by the bridge builders and took ‘a
spin either up or down the stream. The present‘-*
evening, though somewhat cloudy, with an uncer-. 
tain look in the sky to the southeast tempted . '
him to indulge in the aquatic exercise, so he walk-V ’
ed to the uncompleted bridge, got into the boat“
and started up the stream. After he had gone a. .
mile and was thinking of turning back, somebody '_
hailed him from, the shore. ' '. i - n,

“Hello!” he returned. “What do you want?” 

It was nearly dark, and he could barely make,
out the ﬁgure of a man standing down near the?
water. ’ V

“I want you to go up the river a bit. Will you
take me?” p 

“How far do you want to go?” asked Ralph. , "

“Not far,” replied the ma . ‘ 7

Ralph rowed in and took his passenger aboard. 

As the fellow ﬂas ed a match to light his pipe
the boy recognized ' im as Martin Roseberry; ,
one of the men who had pulled him out of the
Detroit River when he met with the accident at '
the railroad bridge. Roseberry also recognized

 

    
 
  
 

    

 
    
        
      
     

him.

“Why, ltello, sonny!~ What are you doin’ up
here?” he asked in surprise._ “Did your uncle,,
fetch you along with him this trip?” ‘ ‘-

“No.' I'm working on the bridge below here, 

   
   
 
     
 

“Nothin’ to speak of,” replied Roseberry
evasively. “Here, give me the cars and I’ll do

Ralph yielded them to him, and -be egan pull-,

same stroke. . ‘

“What do you mean by not far? We have co .

, Two ‘more miles were covered, and the change

\ infthe weather Ralph anticipated began to make ‘
_ itself apparent.

The sky had clouded up more
than ever, makingthe night quite dark, and there

‘ were mutterings of a thunderstorm advancing

from the southeast. The wind, too, had risen,
and the prospects looked scaly for Ralph.
- ffI’ll never be able to get back without a good

what he appea‘red to be up against. “How much
farther?” .

“Don’t worry about me, sonny. I’ll take care

It was clearly an evasive answer,‘ and Ralph
began to suspe-.ct‘that his companion_ had some
very" strong reason for throwing, him off the

' track.

“Well, it’s' nothing to me where Rbseberry

 Roseberry now turned the boat inshore, and

unfrequented spot. Above them rose low cliffs
that seemed part of _a range of i hllls covered

“I heard’ the landlord of the Albert Inn speak-

stalwart man. Emerging from the wood, he came“ . _
to a stop near the plank which crossed to the rock «

and then placed one foot on it, as if testin its.
stability. At that moment the moonlight s one
through a rift in the clouds. It fell across the
man’s features. Ralph uttered a gasp, for he reef» ,-
ognized the newcomer as his boss, Mr. Desmon_d..;-
The young bridge worker was never so surprised
in all his life. The presence of the rich steel.
manufacturer in such a place struck him as being.
decidedly‘ curious. While Ralph was haza-rding a

The thud of a body striking the groundl.

worked on hinges. He saw a rope ladder leading

‘ downinto the hole. _  .

:_ ' “That _will be just the thing, if it's long

Detaching it from the pair of hooks from which

‘it was suspended, he pulled it up and found that
’it was of considerable length, maybe thirty feet.
‘ Taking a bit of candle and some matches he found

' on the dresser, he lighted the former at the ﬁre,
and then, with the rope ladder on his arm, left
the cottage. Placing the topmost rung of the lad-
, dcr over a stump he foundon the edge of the
_ rock. he descended to the lowest rung. Then he

as he let go, and his calculations proved correct.
‘He alighted on the ground with a slight shock.

in the lining below it, I found that envelope. It “
may be the one you were inquiring about some
tinrie ago.” _ i 
_ ‘It is,” replied the boy, delighted at recover-
ing it. I can_now fasten the murder of’ old
Siﬂion on the right man,” he breathed to him-
se .

‘Later on he hurried over to call on Nellie
Gray. He found her in a state of great excite-,
ment and J0Y- 3118 had _Just received a letter‘
from her father explaining the cause ‘of h
long and mysterious absence. .It appeared that v '
after leaving the tavern_on the evening of Simon .

out by~two men in the dark. ‘ .

‘I am, and_ I shall take steps tomorrow to

."I am so glad!” she exclaimed. V

“And you will be my wife in the near future?”

“Y_'es, if you wish me to.” -

_His answer was to take her in his arms and’
kiss her tenderly, and so their engagement and
troth was ratiﬁed that night in the little cotta e-'
near the River Road. Next morning, after ma —
ing the necessary arrangements for Obadiah
Bates’ funeral, Ralph called on a prominent.law’-
yer, told him his story, and gave him the docu-‘

The boy then called on the chief of police and I
had an interview with him, handing him the en-,
velope with the‘evidence connecting Mr. Desmond
with the shooting of the money lender. A de-
tective was sent with Ralph to the f0undry\0ﬂ‘ice.
Mr. Desmond was arrested at his desk, and the

It.:.has long been the habit of these cheery cock-

» PARKING HOG. IS CAUSE OF TROUBLE
Courtesy in driving is constantly being,.,calle”d
to the attention of the motorist, but courtesy is '
susceptible of equal emphasis in the matter of
parking, although not often stressed in this re,
spect according to D. E. Watkins, secretary and
general manager of the California State ‘Auto-'
mobile Association. Showing consideration for
other motorists will go a long way toward solv- ,
ing the parking problem he pointed out ‘ .‘
“The problem of ﬁnding a place to leave One’s
car becomes one of the most acute the motorist ,
faces,” said Watkins. "  " \
“In a survey conducted’ by the American Auto-
mobile Association in many large cities recently,
it was found that an average ‘of ten par 'ng‘
places in each block were not ‘available siin y .
because those cars already parked had taken 3
much more room than was necessary.”

SOCIETY WOMEN IN PARIS WORK. E01! -
DIVERSION 4 i  '_ ,
One of the most popular diversions of women-of!
fashion in Paris is to play at being working wo-
m_en._ Some of them do it for amusement, ‘some to‘
kill time or get a. “new sensation.” someito add a
little more spending money to their incomes. Even
some of the proudest members of : the “ancient
regime” aristocracy being compelled to'se'ek.,e
ployment in industry and commerce to‘ supply’_'
insufficiency of their incomes ﬁnd it m>re...‘_‘chic
to work. There is mention, as participants in- the‘
game, the wife of a portrait ‘painter,*each’~of
whose works is worth as inuchas a pearl jneyck-i
lace, the wife of a prosperous stock broker and,
the wife oflthe director of a_..large'departmen
store. These women go every morning to a grea , .
millinery establishment toserve as working wo-‘N: V
men and submit themselves to all the r-uleyanﬂlf -
requirements of the trade. _  ‘ ' '
However. when noon comes their maids brin
to them suitable costumes to wear in taki _
eon at a restaurant on the Place Vendome.- 
Meantime. while fashionable women thus
portthemselves in work as a game, many
working women, whose living depends iiponﬁtli
labor. ﬁnd it impossible to obtain‘ employnien
