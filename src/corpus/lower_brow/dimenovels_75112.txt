Billy snatched the envelope out; of the man’s

and was off like a streak, slamming the door.
behind him. The express man‘ picked up the en-
velope, and saw that two of thethree red Wax
seals were broken. What he said under his
breath wouldn’t sound well in print. Then he
walked up to the cashier’s window and looked

into the counting-room. Sam Brewsterwas the

only"perso‘n he saw in there. It was about one

lunch.- The stenographer was in her den out of
sight eating lunch and reading a novel.

Sam was so busy with a paper befor€ him,
adding upseverayl long columns of ﬁgures, that

he had, not particularly noticed the brief rumpus‘.

messenger ‘rapped on the glass shelf to attract

The ,

~ o’clock and the other employees were out to their H 

his attention.. He looked up and saw the man’s .

face framed‘ in the opening, and went over to -‘ V

see what he wanted. The messenger shoved his

, book with the envelope, damaged side down, on * i
it in at the window. .

“Sign for this,,wi1l you?’,’“ he said tersely.

friends, though they had little to say to each
other in the office, except on business matters.
Sam looked up as she was passing and she
smiled at him. ,.

“I wish you would make a carbon copy of this,
Miss Bessie,” said Sam, handing her one of .the
papers he had ﬁnished. ’

“Very well; I’ll take it when I come back.”

Just then Sidney Sloane, the cashier, a spr1fcely— ‘
dressed looking man of about thirty-ﬁve, whose

' handsome face wore a supercilious and slightly

dissipated look, came in and walked to his desk.
He and Sam Brewster had never been on partic-
ularly good terms. He was second bookkeeper
when Sam was the oﬂice messenger, and Sloane
took a dislike to the boy from the start for some
reason known only to himself.
' “An express package came a few minutes ago,
Mr. Sloane. I put it in the safe,” said Sam. '
Sloane made no reply, and Sam, having ﬁnished
his job, reached for his hat to go to lunch. His
hand was on the counting-room gate when Sloane
exclaimed: . .
“What does this mean, Brewster?”
Sam turned and saw him looking at the back
' ‘‘What’s the matter?” asked Sam.
“How came these two seals broken?” demanded

the cashier, sharply. '

“Broken?” exclaimed Sam. .

“Yes? broken,” snapped Sloane.‘ “Have you-
been tampering with it?" »

“Tampering with it! Certainly‘ not,” replied the

“Do you mean to tell me that envelope was de-

liveredby the Adams Express in that‘ shape?”

“I didn’t notice that-there was anything wrong
with it when the man handed it to me.” '

“Well, that’s the way I found it when I took
it from the safe. Do you mean to say that you
didn’t know those seals were‘ broken?”

. “Are you sure they were broken when you took
it from the safe?”
"‘Do you mean to tell me that I_ lie?” roared

’ Sloane. “Didn’t I say ‘that is the way I found it?”

“I thought it was all right when the man hand-
ed it to me,” replied Sam. ‘_.‘I have, never yet seen
an express package delivered with even one of the‘
seals broken.” _

“You must have been fooling with it.”

“Why should I? I put it in the safe the moment

the contents. The responsibility will be up to_you,

‘ for you signed for it.” .

The cashier tossed the envelope back into th

‘ safe and opened one of" his books that lay on the

desk. Sam stood with his hand on the brass gate
in a hesitating way, as if he was going to say
something,‘but‘ changing his mind he walked out-

r -side and left the office. He almost ran into ‘a
-Aaportyilooking man who was in the act of _enter-

“Oh, it’s you, Kirby?” ,,

“I know you are. Sloane is back, so if he asks»
you where you have been y.ou’l1 have to have an

“Oh, don’t you worry about me. I’ll answer him
all right,” replied Billy, who then walked off at a
brisk pace.

The other two clerks were at their desks when
Sam got back. He always went to his lunch last
and, of course, returned last. Mr. Jarvis, was in
his private room, having got back from the di-
rectors’ meeting and Sidney Sloane was in there
talking to him about the Adams Express envelope.
Hardly had Sam hung up his hat when the cashier
came into the counting-room. ,

I “Mr. Jarvis wishes to see you in his room
Brewster,” said Sloane with a wicked half—smile:

Sam made no reply but answered the summons.
He foundthe senior partner at his desk with the
express envelope before him. - ~ 0 " '

“I believe you took this from the messenger,
Brewster?” he said. ’ '

should have made the man tal<e‘it_ back to the

It never left the office with the seals broken.
Something must have happened to it on the way
here.‘ Suppose it was tampered with?" Well, by
signing for_ it/you have shifted the responsibility
on us. It is scarcely likely. that the messenger
took any liberties with it—-V-the risk of discovery
is too great. The driver of the wagon wouldliavei

Mr.’ Jarvis opened’ the envelope, took the pack—
age of hills, which looked somewhat rumpled, from
it and counted them. They were, as. the cashier

had surmised from previous experience with Jared "

Cooke, their customer, all $100 bills. The senior

found only nine. Sam mentally counted them,‘ too,

“I hope so,» too. Just wait till I open it and

 “I admit that I am guilty of a serious oversigheti '
1 .

partner counted them slowly. and carefuliy. and‘ 

  

 

   

uneasy when“ he saw there were but nine. Mr.

’ Jaiyis went over them’ again, with greater care

thanbefore, but the result wasthe same. He
turned the envelope over, and saw that it was

'marked “Value, $1,000.”

He picked up Jared Cooke’s letter, which ac-

‘”companied the moncy.V It was an order for the

ﬁrm of Jarvis, Pack & Co. to purchase 100 shares

V. V of B. & 0. at the market for his account on a_ ten
, per cent margin, and he said he enclosed $1,000

to cover the said margin. ~
“Well,” said the senior partner, “Mr. Cooke
says be _enclosed $1,000, but there appears to be
only $900. Either he has made a mistake, or else
the envelope has been tampered with by somebody.

I Were the seals intact when thcenvelope was re-.

ceived by you it would be up to Mr. Cooke, but as
they were broken, and you have let the express
company out of it why I suppose the firm 'will
have to stand the loss.” V

' “No, sir, if $100 has been taken from that en~

lvelope I will make it good, as it seems to be up to

my carelessness,” said Sam. V
‘V‘It is too bad that you should have to pay so

dearly for the ﬁrst piece of carelessness I have i
ever known you to be guilty of, Brewster.”

“Yes, sir; but it happens to be my luck to get
caught. It willteach me a lesson.” _
“I ‘hope so; but we won’t ask you to make this

1 ‘matter good until we have made an investigation.

It is‘ possible that Mr. Cooke only sent $900. I

 shall write him about it. I believe him‘ to be an

honest man. I will also send word to the express
company detailing, all‘ the facts of the case, but
without intimating that We have any -Claim
against them. That is all. Send Miss Brougham
to me, please.”

  " Sam returned to the coun_ting_-room feeling
_ pretty blue. It wasvtough to be obliged to put up

$1.00 because he had neglected to look‘ at the seals
on the envelope when he took it from the" messen-
ger. Fortunately he could easily afford the money,

I but that wasn’t the thing. As he passed tlr‘e-cash-

ier’s desk he saw Sloane looking furtively at_h_im
with a malicious expression. Instantly a suspicion
formed itself in his mind that maybe the cashier

 . had broken the seals himself, abstracted $100, and .
* ;, put thematter up to- him in order to get him‘ in

trouble.“ He knew that Sloane‘ hated him, and

 . would be delighted if he was discharged from the
office. ,It was possible that he had worked the

trick in some slick way thinking to put him in a
bad hole. I 1 i I ' 0

i  ‘After all, the fact that the seals were broken ’
‘rested wholly on the cashier’s statement that he

had found them so. Sam believed he was capable
oflyingto score a. point. However, there was no
wayiof proving his suspicions, so he went to the
stenographerls den and told Bessie -that Mr. J ar—

» vis~' Wanted her, after which he returned to his
. own desk and ‘resumed his work.’ ' The senior part- -
,1 _ ner. dictated two letters-V-—one to Jared Cooke and
- the other to’-the superintendent of the express
' company, and the girlyturned to'he'r machineto

write them off.’ Both, after being signed by Mr.

“What could have happened to it?” .

“You will have to get any further information
about it from Mr. Sloane.” . .

“He told Dixon and me that it had been tam-

“And I suppose he told you that I was the per-

“He intimated something to that effect." »

.-“I can't say that I’m interested in the game.”

“Come up anyway. I’m only going to stay a

minute, just long enough to see if a friend of mine

I’m looking for is there. Then I’ll'walk down

~ Broadway with you, if you are going that way,”
said Andrews, taking Sam‘ by the arm and leading .
‘him,’ rather against his will, upstairs.

They entered a large room ﬁlled With billiard
and pool tables and brilliantly lighted with elec-

‘ tricity. Nearly all the tables were in use, mostly
by young men who seemed to be enjoying them- -

selves. ‘ The scene was rather a novelty to Sam,

who did not frequent such establishments, and he

looked around him curiously. Following Andrews,
who moved about ioolcing for his friend, he pres-

_ v ently found himself at the back of the room where
itheretwere a number of little box-like compart-

ments partitioned offfor customers who wanted
to take a private drink. \ ‘

; “Sit. down ingthere, (Brewster. I’ll be back in a
moment,” said the second bookkeeper, motioning

to one of the compartnients,‘the interior of which,‘
like the others, was partly screened by-a draped H *

curtain.

Sam entered the place and sat down. He had
been there about a minute when he saw Sloane

‘and the man he had encountered at the door of

theoﬂice that day‘ when he went to ‘his lunch, ap-
proaching. The cashier’s face looked ﬂushed, and
he was more unsteady than'ever. The two entered

. the adjoining compartment and sat down.

“What will you have,‘ iﬁiif/by?” hiccoughed

H Sloane. I .

“Whiskey for-me,” said the sporty man. You'd

L " ‘V Next morning a representative of the express
E company called on the ﬁrm and was shown into
V’ Mr. Jarvis’s room. In a few minutes Sam was
 . called inside and told how he received the envel-
'. ope which he had signed for. .,
“You should have examined it carefully before

“So would I,” replied Sam, though privately he
thought heknew. ' " ,

As. his idea was merely a suspicion, of course

— he could not make it known to’his'ernployei', for

he knew that the cashier stood well with the firm. K
“Certainly. you didn't take it, and Mr. Sloane

didn’t take it, therefore it must have been ab- ~

stracted by someone connected with the express 

company,” said the broker; “I think I will hire a

detective to look up the messenger and the driver x . ,
of the wagon. If the theft rests, with them the‘
detective may be able to find it out in some way.’ ‘
We will let your responsibility for the money rest

Week by wee .

Sam bowed and returned to the counting-roo’m.‘: ,( ti’ .
. He would like to have told the broker about the

payment of the $100 by the cashier to Kirby, and, >
suggest that the detective ought to watch Sloane)

' and the sporty man, as‘ well as the two employees ‘

of the express company, but he was afraid Mr. , ,»
Jarvis would notgconsider such a thing at all. A, ’
week passed (during which, much to Sloan-e’s sate ‘
isfaction, D. & .G.,went up eight points, andvthings

~ went on the same as usual at the office. Sam was

never more wideawakein his life/for‘he was <"on' , I I 

his guard against any crooked business’ thatlthe‘

cashier might try to pull 'oil"g>~I,i him. Nothing hap'- . it 

, pened, however, toarouse his suspicions. ~

Sloane maintained» his customary demeanor to~ I 
ward him, addressing him only’ when businessf .
called ,for'it, and as briefly as possible. Bessie .  w'_
told him that Sloane -had‘ apologized to her, and as y ‘ 
the cashier did not attempt to retaliate on him

 

that Sloane would forget his overthrow, but would 
bide this chance to, get satisfaction. Sam deter-  ‘
mined not to afford him the opportunity. One af-A

Sam did so, and found the money correct.

“Now put it in the envelope with the receipt
and seal it up. Bringme the receipt in the morn-
ing signed by Mr. Adams. That is all.”
. The cashiorturned abruptly away, and began
stowing his books into the safe. Usually Sloane
left as soon as all the books and documents were
in the safe and he had turned the handle of the
combination lock. ‘On this occasion he did not
leave until all hands, including the stenographer,

. had departed. The last thing he did was to ad-

dress a large envelope, similar to the one he had
handed Sam. Sam went home, had his dinner and

' then started for the home of Mr. Adams. up in

the Bronx. He walked over to Third avenue and

took an elevated train, which landed him at a sta-
‘ tion six or seven blocks from his destination. Sam
Y. went on his way never dreaming that he was
‘ walking into an ambush prepared for him. ’

He was within a block of Mr. Adams,’ house
when suddenly three masked men jumped ..out
from behind the low fence of one of. the houses on
the block where they had been hiding, and before
liecould put up any kind of a ﬁght he was knocked

- “There’s your man.’ The coast is clear, but
you’d better be quick for somebody might turn up

at any moment.”

The person addressed bent over Sam and feel-
ing of his pockets soon drew out the envelope

_ which had been intrusud to him‘ for delivery to

his firm’s customer. He then pulled a similar en-
velope, but an emphy one, out of his own pocket.

' . Tearing off the end of the bulky one he took out

its contents, peeled oif a couple of hills which he

stuffed in his pocket, transferred the rest of the

contents to the other envelo 3e, sealed it and placed

‘it’ back in Sam’s pocket. V hile he was doing this

     

’ the others, removed their masks and put -them in
 ‘their pockets. One of the men bore a strong like-
V nessto Kirby, the sport.

Having completed his job the chap who had
made the change of the envelopes, rose to his feet
and took off his own mask, revealing the face of
Sidney Sloane.

“Now then, Allen, you remain with him and

:  -bring him to his senses. as soon as you can,

said Sloane. ‘5You know what to saywhen he

4' 7 opens his eyes. After you see him on‘his way
- join us downtown and you will get your money.”

Sloane and Kirby then walked off, while their

1 companion bent down and poured whiskey into
~ . Sam’s mouth, and took other means to bring him

around. In a few minutes Sam came -to his senses
and looked around him in a dazed way. _ ,
“How do you feel, young‘-fellow?” asked Allen,
assisting the boy to rise. ‘ i
5 ‘..‘Kind of groggy. I was attacked and knocked

'1'‘, out by three rascals and I fear robbed of a pack-
:  age I had about me,” replied Sam.

“Yes, I know. I saw the whole thing and I

~ ~..3frig*htened them off before they got much "of a
 chance to go. through you.”

 “Did you?” said Sam, feeling in his pocket.

When he got to Mr. Adams’s house Sam again ’
thanked the man he supposed to be his preserver
and took leave of him. As Sam ascendedthe
stoop and rang’ the bell, Allen hurried away as
fast as he could go, chuckling at the ease with -"v '

Mr. Adams had to admit that things looked bad

He started on the way he came, and on the way
he decided to call on Mr. Smith, his rescuer, and
make a few inquiries. While in the man’s. com-
pany he had not been in condition to ask any
questions. In fact, when he found the envelope
safe he did not bother much about what had hap-
pened to him.

at him rather suspiciously. '

Seeing that the woman was not desirous of

continuing the interview he thanked her, and _

he muttered, as he walked across the street.’ »

then told of the sporty man’s visit to the cashier

in question at the Criterion billard parlors, and!
he repeated the substance of the conversation
he had overheard between the two men.

“Go on with your story,

“I will, sir, and I have no doubt
fairly toward me.”

Sam at once related all the particulars of the
money envelope he had been requested by Mr.
Peck to deliver to‘ Mr. Adams that evening at his
home. He showed the cut on his head as evi-
dence that he had been assaulted. Mr. Jarvis
heard him through without a word. , '

“You say you counted the money you got from
the cashier. and found it correct before you
sealedit up in the envelope?”

‘ /“Yes, sir.”
“And when your recovered your’ senses after

“That is very singular.” .

’tu_rned to me. He tore off the end himself; other- A I N

.“Well?” said the broker. e~ c

. “On my way back to the station,.and about a 

hundred yards from the spot where I was knocked
down, I found that envelope. It is the exact
duplicate of the other, you will observe,” and Sam
handed the second envelope to Mr. Jarvis. ._ I’

Mr. Jarvis looked at it, compared it with the’

in a gutter of the Bronx near where I was struck» a z '

down‘: There must be some connection between
the two.” '

“Your statement is plausible, Brewster, but.re- ‘
member you are making a very se’ri.o'us accusation I
against Mr. Sloane, and one which I am loath to

peculiar to them alone, attracted your attention;’?« 1 " ’
“Let me now give you my reasons for suspect: 

ing Mr. Sloane then you will be able to consider
the matter intelligently,” said Sam.
“Proceed.” «

. ‘ Sam began at the beginning_of his career at,  

' the oﬁice and t9ld‘how he had in some unknown ‘

way got into the bad gracesjof the cashier. He .  :
brought things down to the present and told  V’
about his encounter with Sloane on the street  3
when he rescuedthe stenographer from his insu1t- ,. 7 ~

to be‘ revengedupon, him, for the blow he

out to"him on that occasion. .

I.met,Kirby at the door and he inquired for Mr.
Sloane. I believe he came to the oﬁice to ask

K“ the cashier to settle his debt of $100. Judging

from the conversation between Mr. Sloane and
Kirby, theformer had no money to pay’ him with
when he called. At any rate Kirby asked him
Mr. Sloane

noon by which he got it. That reply and the fact

H" that he paid Kirby-« the $100 within my hearing
, led me to suspect that Mr. Sloane knows how the

express envelope came to be just that amount
—‘»Mr. Jarvis looked startled. '
“Do you mean to say you think he broke the

“ seals and abstracted it?” ' _

“I suspect that he did, though there is no real
proof against him,” replied Sam.
, The broker looked very serious.» The boy’s
story was showing the cashier upin an entirely
new light. Sam then proceeded to tell how

 Sloane offered Kirby $50.to help him in some‘-
scheme that would result in his (Sam’s) dis-

charge from the office.

“There’s a big boom on in D. & G. I’ve just
come from the Exchange. The price is up to 107,
and is going up like a house aﬁre.”"

Sam tore the scrap into fragments and dropped
them into the waste basket. He pulled a sheet
of paper toward him and wrote an order to the
little bank to sell his 100 shares, and signed‘it.
He enclosed the order in an envelogaksealed it

“As soon as you\ can, Billy,” he whispered. .

and returned to the waiting room. Shortly after-

errand took him into the Exchange. Having put it

3 through, and seen that D. & G. was up to a frac-

tion above 110, he made a bee-line for the little
bank and delivered Sam’s order to the margin
clerk. Twenty minutes later some brokers, allied
to the bear interests, began throwing blocks. of
D. & G. on the market in rapid success. The
stock not being sufﬁcientlv supported began to
fall, and the shorts following up the advantage
thus gained, soon succeeded in‘ forcing a slump,
and the Exchange was’ presently almost in a.
panic. When the Exchange closed at three, D.
& G. had fallen 12 points. Sam heard about the
slump and having heard nothing from Billy was
quite nervous over the fateof his deal. At four
o’clock all three partners of the ﬁrm were gath-

' ered in Mr. Peck’s room. Billy was called and
told to send Sam in. '

“Mr. Jarvis wants to see you in Mr. Peck’s

She was always dressed in black, and her
lothes were never in the prevailing fashion, being
seemingly of , an ancient _date. Sam had often
‘Wondered who she was, but never found anybody
who could enlighten him. He ﬁnally came to the
Atonclusion that she was a confirmed stock gambler,
—-who put in her time watching the market when
not ﬁnancially able to speculate herself. This
ittle woman appeared in Wall Street only at cer-
jaili times, and that was invariably a shorttime
before the market took on a boom. She was never

She was not injured in the least, but Sam—

‘well, he looked as if the coroner would ﬁnd it nec-

essary to hold an inquest on him. Of course there
was great excitement, and a crowd gathered like
magic. In the van of the mob was a reporter for
a prominent paper who had seen the catastrophe.

He was one of the persons who had picked" the  

boy up and disengaged theiold woman from his
vise-like grasp. a —
“You’re all right, ma’am,” he said. “This boy
saved your life, but I’m afraid he’s lost his own.” a

CHAPTER X.—-In The Hospital.

When Sam was carried to the drug store, Mes-
senger Bob made a bee-line for the oﬂ‘ice of Jarvis,
Peck &' Ryder. He rushed up to the cashier’s win-
dow to tell the news.

“Well,” said Sidney Sloane, “what do you

' want?”

, “I came to tell you that Sam Brewster, who

works here, has just met with an accident.”

“What's that?” cried the cashier, pricking up

 his ears.

- Bob repeated the information. "«._
—“What happened to him?” ' r , ‘~
“Hit by an auto.” ‘
“Where?”

“Broad Street and, Exchange Place.” ’

“Hurt much?” asked Sloane, with a thrill of
satisfaction at the news. ,

«  /‘Badly. He’s been taken to a drug store on
Broadway- I-Ie’s sure to go to the hospital if he
isn’t slated for the morgue.” .

' ‘Then he really is badly hurt?”

“I wouldn’t take his chances for a gold mine.”
, “Mr. Jarvis is’ in his o-fﬁce. Better go in and
tell him.” '

“Which room?”

"That one,” said the cashier, pointing. ,

Bob started for the door, and Sloane went over
to “Andrew’s desk to tell him the news,

, “My gracious!” exclaimed the second book-
keeper, who liked Sam. “You don't mean it!”

so. .
, - The other clerk came over to learn what was 11%),
and he was sorry to learn that Sam was bad y
hurt. He went into the stencg1'apher’s room and
told her. ’Bessie gave a little gasp, and when the
_.clerk»_said that Sam might die she pulled out her
' handkerchief and beganlto cry._ She thought a
whole lot of Sam, and never so much as since he
saved her from the cashier that night uptown.
‘The afternoon papers printed an account of the
accident, and Bess_ie=choked up when she read it
on the way home. It was just like Silent Sam to
risk his life for another. ‘
“He’s a brave, noble boy,” she thought. leis
sad to think that his life is at stake. I do hope he
-lwill recover.” . ‘

The cashier read the story complacentlyii as he
rode home. He was the only person in the office
who did not feel sorry for the young margin clerk.
On theicontrary, he was glad that Sam had been
bowled over. He did not actually hope that the

"boy would die, but he wished he might be badly
damaged thatl"he could not return to the office.

 Perhaps-he wouldn’t have felt so goodlhad he
g ‘known that the ‘shrewd-looking manwho sat fac-

   

ing him in,.the car was a detective acting under
instructions’ to investigatehis movements out of
- the office. The sleuth, who looked like a prosperous
u business man, was the keenest shadower connect-
lediwith the Wall’ Street Detective Agency, and’
 the case he had‘ in hand was one that called into
, play his best efforts. - ,
‘ 1 ,When Sam recoveerd his senses three days lat-
(er, the head doctor had already announced to a
representative of ‘Mrs. town” that he had a
,chance- for his‘ life‘. M. The

like a ﬂash he remembered his encounter on-.,tl1’o 1

ospital authorities re- s r

   

save the boy, and the brokerage firms of “Jackson &‘
Newberry” guaranteed to foot the bill. A similar
guarantee was received from Jarvis, Peck & Ry-
der. The ﬁrst thing Sam saw when he opened his
eyes was the white-capped nurse sitting close by;

which was written the words “From Bessie.”

It wasn’t until later on that he knew the ﬂowers -
came from the stenographer, and then he was

, (ﬁtlite touched by her thoughtfulness and regard.

e looked around in surprise at his surroundings. ’
He could not understand how he came to bein '
bed in that strangeroom, for he occupied a pri-
vate one, and had a special nurse in the day and
another at night. He had no remembrance of the %
accident, nor of the rescue he had, so gallantly ’
made. When he tried to move‘ he found»that he
was as weak as a cat. He tried to speak,-and his
voice had no ‘power to it.

“What happened to me?” he asked._ .'

The nurse shook her head and put her ﬁnger ‘ =
to her lips. Blocked in his inquiry, Sam tried to’ V:
think, but the eﬁort was a failure. So he lay
quiet and stared at the ceiling like a young in- 
fant. By and by the doctor came in and looked _ 3
at him. , — ‘, 

He heard the nurse say “He is conscious.”  1, _

The doctor felt of his pulse and looked solemn 7‘
and wise. Then he consulted a chart pinned, ‘
against the wall, and noted the patient’s tempera-V
ture taken by the nurse at intervals, and other 
details indicated by the paper. Hetook Sam's 
temperature himself, and after leaving directions:
with the nurse, went his way. Sam took his noun-.-3. ,_
ishment and his medicine in a docile way, and»
waited patiently for his recollection to get on the
j.ob again. He. fell asleep before that happened‘?
It was dark and the room was lighted when he.
opened his eyes again. There was a different’
young woman in‘ a white cap in the chair, other-“
wise there was no change in his surroundings.
He started to speak again, but the samelpanto,-Q
mime cut him short. ‘ .'

“I wonderrif-’—-—” 4 ' ..

But his thoughts would not collect ‘themselves,’ 
and he gave up the attempt to whip them‘int,o
line. His eyes wandered to the flowers and rested
on them. .He fell asleep looking at them.-" Next
morning he was a great deal'better. The.ﬁ1-51;? _
nurse was on duty again and he recognized her; j

“Where am I, and .what’s the matter with me?" .
he weakly inquired. A . »  

She smiled and shook her head. Then he looked. '
at the roses. The nurse smiled again,‘ and broug'hl:Vi‘
them to him, holding the tag so that he could see ; I
what was written on it. ~ _ l J ‘ V

The beauty roses were still in evidence on the
table, but there was a bunch of carnations keep-
ing them company now. These were also from
Bessie, as Sam soon found out, and the folloimng
“So glad to hear that
you are much better—-—-Bessie.” , _

That dayyhe learned what had happened to him.
, “Ahd the little old lady—was she badly hurt,
too?” he asked.

Before the nurse cvould answer, the door opened
and the little old woman came in, looking not a
bit~the worse for the shaking up she had received
several days before. She spoke to the nurse, and

then sitting down by the bedside, took up Sam's

hand and pressed it to her lips. _That action, and
the eloquent look in her shrewd old eyes, softened
a bit perhaps now, spoke her gratitude louder
than mere words- She stroked the patient’s hand,
and then his forehead, with a touch so gentle and
motherly that Sam regarded her with wonder. So
this was a “bucket-shop lariib,” as Messenger Bob
called her, and he had saved her life. Well, her
life was as much to her as .if she was the ﬁrst
lady in the land, and Sam felt rewarded_,by the
magnetic touch of her hand. How could he know
that the rﬁngers that caressed his hair were
strange to that business? That they were more

. accustomed to clipping coupons from $1,000 bonds,

and signing checks for large’ sums? How could
he, indeed, when she looked as if the possession

she said, with a shy glance at his face. ‘
“Almost; Miss Bessie; I’ll be all right in a day »
or so. Now I must go in and see Mr. Jarvis, ifk

“He was in a few minutes ago,” she answered. .
As Sam returned to the reception room, Billy, ;

her head and cried like a kid. Honest, she did,

Sam was much touched by this evidence of  ,

The che k made out to Sam footed up something

:an_ leposited in the Wall Street National Bank
to the credit of Elizabeth Brown. Jarvis, Peck .&
-‘Ryder also sent him a-check, for about $500 for
;lu“_s‘~share of the commission earned out of the
transaction. By that time the market had exper-
ienced a slump, and rices of all stock went down
tof,their~ normal leve . Sam, however, seemed to
_hav“e landed in a streak of luck, for he found out
. about that time that a well-known syndicate was
" beginning toform a corner in A. & D. He irushed
around. to his friend Blackand told him to buy
forvhis account on margin,1,000 shares of it. He
giot“» it at the ground ﬂoor price of 67. That eve-
; ning he called at Mrs. Brown’s home to let her in
on -the tip, but was told she had gone outof town
for a few days.

He got her address and sent her word about

nﬂice. After an interview with Sam, she ordered

had corraled about all that was on the market,
pd effected the corner in it. The best Sam could
 was to get 2,000 shares for the little old wom-
an.. Ten days later A. & D. had the market in a
turmoil and was goin at 90. ,
I 'S.am'sold his 1,000 s ares -at a proﬁt of $23,000,
ndthe old lady made about $60,000 on hers. She
immediately presented Sam with her check for
$10,000 in consideration of the tip, and returned
to the country. Sam was almost staggered by his
good fortune since he had opened up for himself,
for‘ he was now worth $57,000 in cash. No one
thimselfvknew how well off he had so suddenly

about’ his own business as he was about his busi-
ness relationship with Elizabeth Brown. ‘ ‘
"‘That’s too much money for me to keep around
‘e-lollies,” he mused as he counted up the. bills.
"I.d,are say it would be all right enough in my
safe”, for ‘Wall’-» Street is pretty well protected

M:r““Here is myorder on the Wall Street National

the? corner in question. That broughther to his _

heepnie, not even his aunt, for he was as close»

' Soihe took his cash, all but $2,300, around to ‘a

nearby vault, hired a box‘ and put it in it. ’

As matters turned out it was a fortunate move
on his part. He didn’t know that he had been
watched for many days by his old enemy Sidney
Sloane, who laid his discharge to the boy and
thirsted for revenge. Sloane’s'ﬁnancial straits had .
made him desperate, and he didn’t care much what
chances he took in an effort to raise the wind. He
chummed in with the man who had helped him to
do up Sam on the night he carried the eight hun-
dred odd dollars to Mr. Adams. This chap was a
professional crook and a particular friend of
Prentice Kirby, the sport, who had introduced him '
to Sloane for the purpose shown.

His name was Brady, and through himthe ex-
cashier made the acquaintance of other men whose
records were known to the police. They pretend-‘
ed to sympathize with Sloanepin his hard luck
while they ﬁgured how they could makeuse of
him in furthering their own ends. Sloane discov-
ered to his astonishment that Sam Brewster had
gone into business for himself, and he wondered
where he had got the money from to make his
start. He had a great contempt for the boy’s»
business ability, but- he found out through his
Wall Street ‘acquaintances that Sam was doing
well. He learned that Bessie Brougham and Billy
Ross Were“working for Sam, and that indicated
that he must be doing business.

Knowing that Sam was under age and, there-
fore, could not legally keep a business bank ac-
count, he came to the conclusion that the boy kept‘
his money in the oﬂice -safe. He wondered if he
and his friend Bra-dyscould.manage to rob the .»
boy somehow. He talked it over with the crook,’
and Brady brought a friend forward to help in.’
the conference. It was decided that the only Way
the job could be.pulled off was in the daytime"
about the close of business hours. Brady was . '
deputed to watch Sam’s oﬂice and see’ when his ‘
help went home, and note how long Sam remained.
alone in his oﬂice afterward. He put in a Week at '
this and learned enough to satisfy himself and‘
the other'twT.o that the plan was feasible. ‘ ,

One afternoonitwo weeks after Sam had cleaned ’
up the thirty odd thousandon A. & D. he got
wind of another contemplated boom in the mar-. ,
ket. This time the stock was N. & 0.,’ and he sent . 1 
a note to Mrs. Brown by Billy, askingher if be‘. A
could call that evening and tell her about another .
tip he had got on to. Billy was to returnwith an‘ .
answer from’ the little old woman, and Sam sat '
alone in his oﬂice, after Bessie’s departure, ‘wait-* .
ing for Billy to get back. The door opened, and 
three men, who had adjusted masks to their faces .-
out in the deserted corridor, walked in, and be-
fore Sam’ could grasp the situation the laid hold_;_
of -him in a rough way, and gagged , im. so how»,
could not c out. The three masked men bound
Sam’s arms ehind him. . V ‘ ‘

A noosed rope was put around his neck, one end
was slipped. around a coil of. the radiator, and
one of the villainsbegan to pull the line. The boy i
began to choke. 5 i _ 

“Now,” said Brady, who acted as leader in the *5»
proceedings, “give us the combination of -the safe "

_ or We'll show you how it feels to have your breath — 

choked oif altogether.”

Sam gasped for air, but otherwise made 'nu___-i«

' ‘sign that he was willingto comply with the de-
mand made upon him by his chief captor. ‘

CHAPTER XIV.—Conc_'lusion.

The rascal gave the line another pull, and Sam’s

 face began to turn purple from the pressure of
. his windpipe. At that moment there were steps

‘ coming toward the oﬁice in the corridor outside.
They stopped in front of the door and the handle
was turned. Brady held up his hand for silence,
at the same time easing up the strain on Sam's

' neck. The person outside was Billy, who had just
‘returned with his answer. He was surprised to
ﬁnd the door locked, for Sam had told him he

would wait for him. Finally he knocked.‘ Sam had ‘

1-eeognized 'Bil1y’s footsteps and had heard him‘
try the doo’r. If he only could cryout. he believed
Billy would instantly’ conclude that there’ was
.. something wrong. That, however, was impossible.
“Atﬁhat moment Billy knocked. Then it was that

, Quickas a ﬂash he bent one legand kicked his

 loud, metallic sound. _ Brady’s crook associate

Brady dropped the end of the rope that held

used Jack pretty roughly. The.otl_ier boys were
amazed at Jimmy’s ﬁghting abilities, for up to
that time they thought that he was really parry-

 them off than to thrash them.
Now, he was striking right and left, and whom-

I will maintain that I did hear Sally claim that

“Then the. blame lies at her door. There is

nobody in this community that would believe that

The news of the ﬁght soon spread all over the

Without another wdrd young Holmes ﬁred away I

 

at Jimmy, his fist grazing his cheek rather

roughly.

Now, young Holmes was the larger of the two;
boys, but Jimmy was more active, and in the",
scrimmage that followed he got the worst of its...

and had both eyes badly bruised.

else, not expecting that so much trouble would

It was the same old, old story where a trusting
 girl had lied in the interest of love.
' As for Halstead, Holmes never. did like the
fellow.‘ and he promisedhimself to even up mat-
ters in the affair by giving Halstead a good
thrashing the ﬁrst chance he got, and said to him-
 sefzéf that the ﬁrst time he met Jimmy he would
TI 0 er hirnhis hand and apologize to him; and he
was honorable enough to keep his promise.
Such a scandal could not be kept down, and
young Holmes said:

“He may be able to thrash me as he threatens to

you fellows are satisfied with making all the
rtlfouble you could out of it. I did ask Sally to
corroborate my story_, but _it was because I had
grown tired of hearing Jimmy being called by
everybody Truthful James, and his bragging that
he never drank in his lifge. I had heard several
others say that they had seen_ him _drink liquor

one evening I foolishly claimed that. he d .

was true, and stated that if I would make the

“But it seems she did.” remarkedia friend.

“Yes; but then I didn’t know anything about
the power of love. She didn’t tell that story for
the purpose of making mischief. She did not
think it would go any further, and when she saw-
the mischief it was doing, like the honest girl she
is, she thought it best to make a clean breast of
it and tell the truth, and she did so. I think more-
of Sally Holmes for having done so, for that
shows the honesty of the girl.” . .

“Well,” said the young man with whom Jimmy

that I’d never forgive her.”

that she is honest and that you arenot.” , '

FOOTBALL UNDERGOES CHANGES
I . IN THE CITY.
_ F_ootball in the New York public parks and
streets emerges from the hampering con-
ditions imposed there in greatly altered form. On
. oiievof the playing ﬁelds of Central Park, where
there is mud, no place to put on the time-honored
 no goal posts, and no assurance that the
-spade will wait if it is not hurriedly seized, the
' has evolved into a mixture of football,
basgetball and tan‘. _ _ _ '
 Istead of the usual line-ups and skirmishing
heife are only punts, which are run back by the
 catching the ball. The ball may be passed
from player to player, as in basketball; and
, thrrgboy carrying it, instead of being tackled and
».dow_iied, in the mud as in ordinary football, is
.‘down” when he is t. gged. The game; has action,
even though it might not be recognized by its
hardier ancestor.
