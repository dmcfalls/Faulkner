CHAPTER I.--—Bob and His Sister.

“Why, hello, Nellie, what brings you here at
"s time, of the day, and why do you look so
I‘emn?” asked Bob Carson, messen er for Ed-
8. Fitzball, broker, of No. — Wal Street, to
retty, bright-eyed lady, about a year older
himself, who had just entered the office.

.Nellie was his sister, and an expert stenog-
apher, who had been working_for Nathan Cop-_
V 'y,- an Exchange Place broker, for the past six

oaths.’ '

was quite proper for you to cut loose from him
under the circumstances. He owes you foul‘.
days’ pay. I'll go around to his oﬂice and
collect it for you, for, of course, you wouldn't
care to go back and demand it yourself.”

“I certainly would not, much as we need the ’:

money. It's too bad I am out of work, for,
mothed depends on both .of us to turn in our
wages. I must try and get another position
right away.” _

“Oh, there's no great rush. We won’t starve
because you’re not working.”

“But mother will be sure to fall behind in
the rent.” ' °

“No, she won’t. I’ll see that’ she gets that, '

and anything else she needs.”

“Of course I can.

the girl, curiously.

' “You promise not to tell mother?”
“That will depend,” replied Nellie.

“On What?” ‘
“Whether it's right I shouldn’t tell her.”

“If I've kept it from her, and from you, too, 

for weeks, there is nothing improper about it.”
“Well, tell me.”~

. “I’ve been speculating in thelstock market   I
the-last six months, on the quiet, and I’ve made 

quite a» little wad of money."
“Is that true?” ~
“Sohelp me bob, it is.” .

;‘,I’~Iow, ,aren‘t you the mean boy not to tell. 

‘-‘No, I’m not mean. i I have an object.”

"I can’t show you the cash just now, but I
can show you a certiﬁcate of deposit on the lit-
tle bank on Nassau street where I put my
deals through. You know what a certiﬁcate of
deposit is when you see it, don’t you?”

’ “Yes.”

“Very well. -Feast your eyes on that,” and

Bob drew a paper from his pocket and showed

it to his sister. V
As it bore the lithographed form of the bank,
and was ﬁlled out in Bob’s name, his sister
ﬂould not doubt its genuineness. ‘
“Oh, Bob, why didn’t you give mother some
’ of‘ this money? You know she needs it,” said
Nellie. I
' v“I’ve only just made the greater fart of, it on
«a lucky deal I closed out three ays ago. I
was thinking about handing her $100, but I
was afraid she’d ask me where I'got so much
money, and I didn’t want to give my secret
away to her yet.” V
, “Well, you could giveiher $25, and tell her
you made it in stocks. She won’t ask any ques-
 tions, she’ll be so glad to get it. Then in av lit-
.tle while you can give her another $25,‘and tell
her the same story. Now that I’m out of work‘
she’ll need the money badly.” . ‘
“I told you not to worry about the rent, or
anything else. I mean to make more mone

, won’t let mother go ‘short of anything she
needs. .Say, sis, I’ve got~an idea,” said Bob,

 

suddenly. “Do you know I think it’ll be, just
A; the thing for you.” .
V “What is it?” \

“Johnson,’the patent man upstairs, remarked
yesterday in my hearing that somebody ought
to’ start a public stenographer’s office in this
building. _ He says he hasn’t enough work to
hire agirl steady, and there are many like him
in. the house. He has to send out for a girl to
come in and take dictation, and the others have
' to do -the/same. This is rather expensive, con-
sidering the amount of work to be done, as the
irl’s time is charged up from the moment she
eaves her office till she gets ‘back again. And
then there are‘ messenger charges.

'she‘ is only partly employed, but everybody
hasnft room for a girl‘. Now there's a small

Mr. Brown, B‘r,okeri,Fitzball and Bob Carson

’ ‘at an old-fashioned inn on the suburbs 0f_the
age- This inn had frequently been patronized
rokers from Wall Street, one of whom had
Vminended it to Mr. Fitzball. It had the repu-
 of’ furnishing-_ good entertainment, and its
tation was deserved. The proprietor, a man

things were doingup in the -Bronx, New York,’ ‘
that would have taken all the zest out of Mr.
Brown’s outing had he even dreamed of their \
nature. But he didn’t, not being gifted with , .
second sight, and he retired ignorant of the fact "
that his much-loved ward, pretty Bessie Dale,
was at that moment in the power, drugged and
unconscious, of his rascally nephew, Guy Stan- .
ford,‘ and that his home had been cleaned out -
of everythin ' of portable value that.Stanford’s, i
aiders and a ettors, Harding and Jackson could
carry away in the night hawk cab. , ;
The said cab having deposited _the booty, the‘
girl, G-uy Stanford and the two crooks at the
doorof a certain house in Jersey City, the three

' male passengers lost little time in transferring,

themselves, the girl and the swag to a touring,
automoblie, which, under the expert management ,
of Harding, was soon speeding toward the very .
village, and the ‘very ‘same inn, where the three» ’
New ., Yorkers were at that‘ moment tranquilly
sleeping. ‘ , ,
An early breakfast was awaiting Mr. Brown, T —
the broker and Bob when they appeared in the _ »
public room of the inn» as the ﬁrst streaks of“,
dawn were beginning to lighten up the sky. As

soon as they had eaten it they started.out on
. their day’s shooting, accompanied by a boy con-

nected with the inn whom Mr. Brown had hired
to show them the best places to ﬁnd game. They '
carried‘ their lunch with them and did not re- ,
turn until xthe shades of evening were falling

‘ over the landscape.

They were tired but in, excellenthumor, for ~.
they had bagged a ﬁne» lot. of, birds. After a '
good wash they sat down to supper with a ﬁne
appetite. , , ‘ , _ x _
“«I’ve had the time of my life’ today,” said »

- “ ’m glad you enjoyed yourself,” saiduMr.

Brown, who seemed to have taken quite a fancy,» '

to the manly young messen r. 
_ V“Youth 'is»_ t-he time to enJoyi one’s self,”_ put i‘
in Broker Fitzball, with a. smile. ,“I often linger
over recollections of my own youn days before .

of my thoughts and actions.” -‘ 4.  I
“Ch; We_1,» we can’t always remain young;

C j‘ Having eaten a héarty supper, he thought a
; short walk in the bracing air would do him
ood. There was no entertainment for him to

. A I, oin Mr. Browncand Broker Fitzball, and listen
,.'V'ﬂ- to their talk. Youth prefers to hobnola, «with
youth, so Bob concluded to look up the lad who

accompanied them on their trip. ‘

After walking up the road a short distance

7 and back, he went around to‘ the back of the

, " inn. Here he found a yard, with an open shed
 _.'and other outhouses, beyond which lay the de-
ﬂnuded ﬁeld's., He saw light shining from the
‘ windows of an ell, and from the rattle ofdishes
  in. that quarter-he concluded it was the kitchen.
' .‘ .He walked over and peered in through one of
V the windows. The boy he had come to lookfor
 and a woman were busy with pots and pans, as
Y .well as thepile of supper dishes. Bob saw
that he couldn’t' intrude on’ the youth for the

- , resent, for he had his hands full of work, so
-  lie strolled around the yard. He came to the

 

.  barn, the door of which was partly open. A,
. :1antern hanging from a nail on a post dimly ~

  

-'illuminated the interior. The place was ﬁlled
with various kinds of agricultural implements,
harness, a'couple of wagons and a heavy sled,

‘_and- diverse other farming paraphernalia. His

, curiosity to inspect some of the things that were

“new to. ‘him induced him to step inside‘ and look

.. around. He. was bending over a cultivator-.whei'1
, «two persons walked into the barn. They did not

A’ a.‘

  

notice his, presence and came to a stop not _far-

‘ ffrom him underpthe lighted lantern.
 “Say, Hardin , what in thunder are we go-
to do?” sai a voice that sounded a bit fa-
, mi iar to'Bob. "‘I.neve_r heard of anything more
unlucky. This inn, that you spoke of being
‘such a snug retreat for the girl, shelters at this
moment my uncle, her guardian. Why, if he

“Then what's the use of getting rattled? This,

-what they considered was coming to them in an '
.way that seemed most easy of success. So,;as
we have said, they followed Bob to the home,o_
his sweetheart, and lay in wait for him to com _
out. Bob was seldom able to tear himself away
from his ‘charmer much before eleven. Even
’ after he got started it took him ﬁfteen ininuté3“ _
‘generally to say good~night, between. kisses,-for.» :

just as loath to have him leave, and helped faloag"

‘ladies under -such circumstances. Harding‘ a
Jackson, waiting outside in the uncomfortable.
 night air, growled over the long time that Bob

a girl in the case, and they wondered if he .‘lIl_
tended __to stay until midnight. At.-ten minnt
after eleven Bob issued from the’ house,

to save ‘his life. ,He wasn't conquered", though‘ ‘-

HAPTER XIII.—Bob Secures a Dandy Tip and
u , Makes a Big Haul.

 Next morning he reported‘ the occurrence to
::l%Police Headquarters over the office telephone, ex-
"laining his suspicions concerning the identity
% the gentlemanly looking foot ads. A de-
ﬁtective was sent out to look for em, and Bob
went. about his business as usual. Before he
?'went home he wrote a letter to Bessie, detailin /
' ‘ strenuous adventure of the night before, an
the girl nearly had a fit when she read it. He
’ said nothing to his mother or sister about

ycluded to tell his sister at her oﬂice for he kept
~«:rno_secrets from her, as he considered her the best
paister in the world. ' As soon as he was through

,, She was out, but the two pretty typewriters in
er employ were busy at their tables. ‘They both
' ded and smiled at Bob, whom they knew was
ellie’s brother. His good looks and manly
qualities had made an impression on their sus-
eeptible hearts, and not dreaming that he already

5*‘ _ y both tried their feminine witcheries on

 bestowed his smiles and talk on both of the
young ladies without any partiality. Finally he
last down at his sister’s desk to await her return.
, ‘doing so he accidentally brushed off on the
{ﬂoor a_ couple of typewritten sheets that lay
Blank side up. He hastened to pick them up. In
 them to the desk he put them down
,1v,1'_1tten side up. Carelessly glancing at them he
saw that one was a ﬁlled-in contract for the leas-

In a few words Bob told her the incident and 0
then took his leave. ’

“So the Somerville Trolley Company is going

into the combine at last,” he thought as the,ele-
vator carried him downstairs. “There will be a
boom in that stock when the news gets out. I'd
like to get hold of some of it, but I'm afraid it's
already been gobbled up by the insiders. How-
ever, I’ll try for it to-morrow. Sister would not
tip me off because she was given the -contract to
do in conﬁdence, and she is too honorable to let
any secrets out of her ossession. She must
have done the work herse f, for it would be _
risky to trust an employee with such a valuab e
bit on inside information. Either of those girls
moight be cute enough to pass the news to some- ,
b y who would make use of it, and the fact
might reach the ears of the person “who gave sis
the work and then her reputation in business
would be hurt.” 7

Bob went to lunch and then spent half an hour ‘ ,
or more looking up information connected with 
the Somerville Trolley Company. By that time " ‘
it was nearly ﬁve, and he returned to his sisterfs ~
oﬂice to escort her home. She was surprised to
see him back, for she thought he had gone home. 

“I thought you'd gone uptown, Bob,” she said... a 5 «

“You see I haven’t. ,I called to take a you '
home.” ~ -

“Did you? The honor will be yours in a few
minutes as soon as I arrange a few matters.” .

“Take your time. I can wait your con-l
venience.” V « -

Ten minutes afterward they left the oﬂice to-r ' '
gether. When Bob paid ‘his ﬁrst visit to the
Exchange next morning he found a chance .to’
run up to the little bank and leave his order for
2,000 shares of Somerville Trolley stock. He had
some doubts about the bank's ability, to secure,
that amount, and so he told the margin clerk to _
get him any part of 2,000 shares. When he _
called in that afternoon after he had ﬁnished"his
work he found that the full 2,000 had: been
bought and was held subject to ‘his order. After.
that he kept close watch on the ﬁnancial paIp:rs,;
to see what developments were reported. ‘ , a v
few days the rumor was circulated arounldpthe
eased
by the traction trust. The stock jumped ‘ﬁve 
points right away on the strength of it, though
the report was not_o1ﬁcially conﬁrmed. After.
that the rumors continued to come out, and there '
was a good deal of businessdone in S. 'I‘., and it ,'
was soon apparent that the stock was uncom-  .
monly scarce. This fact caused another stiff rise.’ '
A week. from the time Bob bought ‘the shares.
they were quoted at twelve points above what he’ '
gave for them, and this represented a gain to
him of nearly $24,000.: The price rose three"
points more inside of the next two ,days. Then':.
came the official conﬁrmation of the lease, and _T
up the stock went more than ten points more

 “I'll -think it over,” said Bob.
E e did, and the result was an arrangement
{with the owners for the purchase of the mine
and control of the stock. Bob bought the ma-
acliinery and other material which the prospector
’ said was necessary. It was shipped to the
ound and work was resumed, but this time in

fiilfen began to peter out. Bob had to put more
money into the enterprise to keep things (going.
One day, however, the lead was recovere , and
after‘ that it proved plain sailing. A new com-
 was fo-rrried and Bob was elected one ofthe
' ctors, andthe directors elected him president
and general manager. The mine proved a great
guccess, and when this was demonstrated, the
Jitock was listed on the Curb at $2 a share. As

090, and as the company was indebted to him to
the amout of nearly $60,000 for invested cash,
jiieconsidered himself worth a pretty tidy sum.
A year later he sold, out his control of the mine
or anileven million, and soon after he and Bessie
were married, and went on a honeymoon trip

brightly-on Bob Carson, and he never regretted
going the limit.”

 ISLAND COLONY LIVES BY SALE4
’ OF SALT FROM THE SEA

—=»In the Atlantic Ocean, not far from Santo
, ‘mingo, lies a group of tiny islands, known. as
 Islands, 9. part of the British West Indies-
These. islands, which are of coral formation, were
. ettled during the last century by educated pio-
‘lﬁiéers from England and Bermuda, ‘who very
ggliclcly developed a prosperous and interesting
" our-T .
This group consists of nine islands called Cays,
Grand Cay, Salt Cay, Eastern Cay, Cotton Cay
‘d Sand Cay are the most important. Grand
;y_:i's the largest. Salt Cay, the next largest, is
djfor the production of the best curing salt.
',€he“centre of the island is laid out in “pans”
iiliﬂferent sizes. These pans are made by build-
. stone walls, two or three feet in height,
*" amid‘ ‘a level base or platform. The, enclosure
’ Qheﬁiogmeiited on 'sides_and base to protect it

Bob owned 151,000 shares out of an issue of 200,- "

t.«_s_ea water_'.'*At _a certain ‘

season of the year a’ sluice gate is opened to
admit the salt water direct from the ocean, so as , , 1
to ﬁll a large reservoir, or main pond, as it is
generally called. When this body of water"
reaches a certain temperature through evapora-
tion it is used for ﬁlling the pans where evapora-
tion is completed.

The pans are ﬁlled from the main pond, by
water wheels built on the walls of the pans, gen-
erally two wheels to each pan. One is reminded '
of a miniature wind~mill.

Sand Cay enjoys a little notoriety as a pirates’
nest, whose booty was removed by some adven-
turous Americans in the middle of the,last cen-
tury.' Excavations still yield a few scattered
Spanish doublons, which are kept as souvenirs.
This treasure hunt gavea little halo to this bar-
ren island. It became a favorite picnic spot where
every one hoped to ﬁnd some hidden treasure. ' ,

 

srovas BROUGHT HERE BY THE EARLY‘, 
DUTCH -

_ Stoves ‘are supposed to have been introduced
into Colonial America by the Pennsylvania Dutch. . _
The earliest were of. curious design. A particu-
larly odd one used in churches was of sheet metal. ‘ ’
It was shaped like a box; three sides were within
the _church; the fourth with the stove door was
outside, which made it possible to stoke during
religious services with a minimum of distrubance '
to the worshippers. . , "
Possibly the Winters in the North Atlantic
States are as severe as they were in the 1600s
and 1700s, but modern progress has reduced their
terrors; The present generation would fancy
it could not have.survived the discomforts and-
inconveniences of an early Colonial home. The
biting winds poured down the great chimneys, ‘
sifte through crevices in walls and ﬂoors and -
rattled the loosely ﬁtted windows. The crackling , '
logs in the ﬁreplaces diffused a comfortable 
warmth only a few feet from the actual blaze.

Cotton Mather and Judge Samuel Sewall re-
corded in their-diaries that frequently the ink‘ ,
froze on their pens as they wrote not far from the ' '
chimney side. One of them said that when logs, -
were brought in from ‘outdoors and laid on‘ the
ﬁre, the sap oozing from the freshly sawed ends '
froze into ice drops. 1 i .

Seldom were the bedrooms warmed. Deep ‘
feather beds and heavy bedi curtains were the ’ 
only'things that made these slee ing apartments
endurable. Warming pans, and later soapstones’ , ’
and hot bricks were employed to mitigate‘ the ‘ Y
ﬁrst frigid entrance to bed.

One of the young men who had come wi g
Williams turned to young Hicks and asked him
why he had come along. I I * Y  ~'
T “For the same reason that you did,” reto

“Oh, you want to have a ﬁght, do you?”

“No, not particularly, but I do want to see’
Jimmy have a fair show, and he is going to have’
it, or I will know the reason why.” ‘ ’ , .

“Say, boys, drop that sort of talk,” said M: .
Williams, “and we will go on to town, and settle’
the matter in a legal way.”

“That’s good advice,” said Jimmy, who touched“
his horse with the whip, and went dashing down’
the road, leaving Williams and the two young
men with him to follow after. » . _ 

Jimmy reached the village fully half an hour
ahead of the usual time for court to convene. _ ' '

The town marshal met him, and told himftlia
feeling was running pretty‘ high on account of .
George having been locked up the nigl;it,before‘.;

_“And George is swearing,” he added, “like;
pirate, that he’ll get even with you, let it cost’
what it will. Take my: advice, Jimmy,” he went‘
on, “and get Philip Johnson to representyou, ‘for;
George’s father has employed Squire Huckberr
to represent his son.” , -

Just then young Johnson, the lawyer, an-,
peared in sight; and the marshal beckoned to 
so Johnson came up and greeted Jimmy good-‘r,
humoredly. , ' ' . I

“Jimmy,” he asked, “who is going ‘to repre-p

“You will,” said Jimmy, “provided you 
charge too much. I never employed a lawyer

home to defend myself in the court-house just.
I did when George tackled me.” ’ 
“Well, that's all right, Jimmy, but that wa

“That’s,all right. I’ll have some fun withold‘

Nearly all of them admired Jimmy for the way '13

Johnson surpassed him. .

.' Johnson kept the crowd roaring with laughter,

for-as he spoke of the testimony of each witness

for George he wound up with sarcastic repeti-

"tions, of the witnessess tothe effect, “But George
was drunk ” .

. -“Yes, your honor,” said Johnson, “he was in-

;

Watson was sober. It is to be everlastingly re-
etted, that Jimmy didn't strip him as far as
_, cency -would permit there on the public street,
aindpjlwith that rawhide whip actually ﬂay him
ive instead of taking him to .the lock-up.”
Georges father's face showed plainly the keen-
1i_ess_o his feeling of disgrace, as he. listened
o».youn J ohnson’s exortations of his son.
,; But eorge had long since passed the natural
‘ride.’-of a young man under such circumstances
and felt more keenly the fact that Jimmy had
’§nocked him" down, tied his hands behind his
 cast him into the wagon and driven him to
'e lock-up. '

His father, and the justice before whom the case
as being tried, had long been personal friends,
and George was relying upon that to save him
rom any kind of punishmentvother than a. mere
trivial ﬁne. . _ i '

 As loud laughter at the witticism of the young
‘lawyer ﬁlled the court-room,the face of the elder
Williams ﬂushed angrily; and several times young

{ohnson"s wit turned upon the lawyer. Huckberry.

,H.e.eyen played upon his name, and said there

éave young Williams from the consequences of

‘sfspeech he said that his father, instead of be-
mﬁ“ present to pay his lawyer’s fee ought to
"hind ready. to see his ‘son consigned to State
prison for his’coward~1y attack on his client.
Then Williams lost his temper and blurted.out
the court-room that he wasn’t there to listen
t"o"=advi_se from him.
"fSo much the worse for you and your dutiful
on,” repliedthe lawyer. ' '
 "The, case ended by the justice ﬁning George
‘twenty-ﬁve dollars for his disorderly conduct, he
' stand committed until the ﬁne was paid.
‘Mark itpaid right now.” said George’s father,
‘taking ' out his wallet and counting out the
ﬁhxourit of the ﬁne.‘ V

Elthehpresent circumstances, says Le Matin, for;

wells were driven, in many cases down to 500 feet .

Again, in special cases where an especially large

supply was to be obtained, this led to ‘the con-' ll‘/'

struction of veritable waterworks with pumping-

machines on a iarge scale and pipe lines of several, ‘ E
_ length. For instance, at four or ﬁve.po1nts there

are_now plants which elevate as much as‘25,O00g . ll
cubic feet per. day and distribute it in thecavmpys '_f
as iwell_as to watering tanks for the cavalry and - 
reservoirs used for supply of steam engines. V
In the army zone, the water supply is organized.

on standard methods. For the troops, the lay- .
outs existing in the villages are improved and E E

extended. Reservoirs and hydrants are erected; 

near hospitals and barracks or camps, and tank , ,
stations are ‘spaced along the roads for use for *
the travelling kitchens and motor tank*wag‘ons. ’

 

UNDERGROUND izivsiis ARE F'oUNDvT0

* One of nature’s oddities is the underground 0
river, many of which have been, found beneaththe 3 7
United _States. Streams under the earth's su1‘- E‘
face arise in three different ways. One of themis
by water seeping through limestone rock and 
ning under the surface, to emerge some distance ; _
away. ‘Charles P. Berkey, lfrofessor of Geology; ,
and Mineralogy at Columbia University, sa 3 
that “the underground waters moveith‘rough7.t e ;
fractures and joints of the rock aiid.graduall'y
dissolve some of it, making in this way more ‘and, 0
more room for the ﬂowing water. . . '. This kind
of action forms caves, many of which are extei‘i- J
sive indeed.” . /V  '3 « E
. In many limestone regions small Estiieams de-
veloped on thesurface have disappea;red“i11to .t}'ieE

.In front of a theatre in Forty—fourth street
, stands a concrete pedestal surmounted by a med- *

ieval head done in stone. Ordinarily it does not

" attract as much attention as the sculptured basket '
