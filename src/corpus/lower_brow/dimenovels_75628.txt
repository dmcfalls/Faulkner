across the table,ythinking to nab him in that way.

As the boy drew back out of his reach, the table 7
toppedunder his weight and mate and table went a . -
down _on the ﬂoor with a crash that shook the’ V 
room. . —

‘ That ended the contest between the two, for  ;
Redriﬁ’s head came in contact with the edgeofg ‘ 
a heavy metallic spittoon, and what with the * 
shock of the blow, and the fumes of bad whisky i 
which rushed to his head, the mate rolled over on . xi

“Come and have’a drink, young~..feller,” cried
another mariner, standing near by, grabbing the
boy by the arm and, dragging him up to the bar. »
_ “You’ll have to excuse me. I don't drink,” ob‘-o ’
iected the‘ lad.’ ,  _ "
“Then this here is a good time for you to learn,"
persisted. the seaman, calling to the, barkeeper to
furnish them withytwo drinks. . ,
f‘No, Idon’t want to learn,” answered the lad,
trying to release his arm. - "' «,.~ 7 x V _

and threatening to lay it over the head of the first
"man who raised a further rumpus. Blaine then
_V subsided and_ drew off to the table where he had
been drinking by himself. , V '
" “Well, rnylad,” said the" other sailor, “what
brought you in here?” , ~
“Ivcame here with a note."
“Who for?”
. “A man named Mark Redriff, mate of the brig
Cormorant.”
The sailor grinned broadly.
“Then you’ll have to wait till he comes to his
senses.” » ,
“What do you mean?” asked the boy. .
“Why, Redriff is the man who tried todown
you. That's him on the ﬂoor.”
“It is ?” exclaimed the surprised lad.
_ “Aye, aye.’ That's Mark Redriﬂ’. How came you
to fetch that there note to him?”
“A gentleman, a stranger to me, gave me two
bits to deliver it.”

‘ “A gentleman, ch ? What’s your name, sonny?”
“Jack Granville.” '
“You can leave it with the barkeeper to give to

the mate when he comes to his senses. It might ’
not be healthy for you to run up ag’in Redriif
after what’s happened.” .

1  “I was told that it’s important. and that I must

: x V give it to‘ nobody but Mark Redriﬂ’ himself,” re-
 plied Jack. '

‘ “And you mean to do that, eh?”

“I do. I always follow orders.”
“You’ve got good nerve.” ~ 7

. “I guess I can take care of myself,” replied the
boy, coolly. ' '
’ “You don’t know the mate.”

“I don’t want to know him.” _ - 5 ‘ ,.

“Don’t mister ‘me. My name is Ben Brown.

everybody calls me Ben,”
‘ “Well, I’m much obliged ‘to you, Ben Brown, but
I'm going to hand that note to Redriﬁ myself, for
my instructions were positive, and I don’t care to
, go back on them.”

' . . “All right, my hearty. Do as you please, but if
the mate wipes the ﬂoor with you don’t say that
‘ ' I didn't warn you.” , _ ._ y
' “I don’t blame you, Ben Brown,”, said Jack,
« seating himself at the nearest table.

The sailor returned to his own table. . i
9 I Everybody in the saloon had heard the con-
.versation between them and they regarded the-
gboy with not a little curiosity. .

Joe saw the point and looked glum. '

‘.‘I guess we might as well give up all idea of

‘ “Why should we? To~morrow we’ll try and ﬁnd

a chance to ship on some craft bound for Sydney,

The boys were so enthused over J ack’s plan that
theyxlost all interest in the auction sale they had
stepped in to‘1ook at, and left “Cheap J ohn’s” in

 order to talk It over without interruption. 1,

They walked over the Plaza, half ,a block away,
sat down on a bench and began to figure out their
line of /action for the next morning. .

Then J ack, planned what they should do on

, reaching an Australian port.

Neither doubted that a, man would easily be
found to take an interest inythe‘ treasure hunt,
since it would be money inhis pocket. if the gold
was discovered. .

1 Jack ran’ up the ladder, followed by his com-
panion. They saw a group'of sailors" around a
“small deck-house, which, as it had‘ a small chi_m-
' ' ney projecting through the roof, from which

, smoke was issuing, Jack judged was the galley.

. The boys approached the open door of the house

' with some diﬂidence. The foremast hands, who

«were lounging around the entrance eating from

tin ’pannikins and drinking hot coffee out of tin
cups, eyed them curiously. As they came up
Ben Brown came out of the galley with his break-
fast in his two hands. x ' ‘ .
“Hello, my heartiesl,” he cried cheerily. “Walk
right in and ask the doctor to serve you. He’lI

' lend you a couple of cups and pans till you're
served out ship—shape from the brig’s slop-chest.’_

“Why, keel—haul me if these lubbers aren’t the
two chaps we met _on Green’ich‘ Dock, Ben,” said
Bill Blaine, recognizing the boys. “So you chaps
have shipped aboard this hooker, have ye?”‘

2. “No, they didn’t ship,” replied Brown. ‘They
_ ; were shanghaied last night.”

"The deuce they were!’f grinned Blaine.

One or two of the sailors regarded‘ the boys
with sympathy, but the others. seemed to be in-
different as to the fate that had overtaken them.

f‘Cookie,” cried Ben, “here’s a couple of green
hands who want their grub.” \

The cook, generally alluded to as the “doctor,”
stuck his head out at the door and scanned the
boys curiously. He was a native of the Sand-
wich Islands, and his skin’ was beautifully brown
~ and shiny. Beckoning the lads inside he supplied

' them with breakfast, and the utensils necessary
to eat it out of. During their meal the boys were
"joshed” quite a bit by the sailors, but they took

, the witticisms passed at their expense good-na-
_< turedly, and on the whole made a favorable im-
7 ‘ ression on their new associates. After breakfast
 ey were ordered aft by the captain, who, after
“ a critical survey of their faces and persons, turn-

Mark Redi-iﬂ:' had at ﬁrst regarded their appear-
ance on board in some surprise, for he recognized

.

them as the boys he had met -in the Paciﬁc Street‘

saloon, /. G
"I‘hé"n a look of satisfaction came upon his fea-
tures, for he now recollected the scrap he had with
1 Jack Granville over the seedy lad, and he'saw
; hi op ortunity to get square ‘several times over
with,th)e boy. He said nothing to them before the
‘skipper. There was lots of time ahead during the
long voyage ‘to make the two lads toe the mark
zr in a way they would remember all their lives. He
i took them down and ﬁtted them out to a sailor's
kit from: the brig’s' chest, and then dismissed them

CHAPTER VTI.-—The Mate and the Boys 
A Together. —  i‘

The ‘boys stood on the beach near where ﬁg
had come ashore and looked at Coﬂin Rock wi _
a good deal of curiosity and interest. ,It_,seeipe,d
a strange coincidence that theypshould be cast \
away on the very island they wanted to reach.

That yonder rock was the hiding-place of.the
pirate’s treasure they did not ‘doubt, for they
could not believe that there could be two such
huge coﬁin-shaped rocks in the South Seas. It ’ «
certainly borean extraordinary resemblanceto‘
an old wooden coﬂin. How nature had formed it
so accurately in that gruesome shape they could
not guess. It stood a short distance from the
beach, and its base was now buried in a mass of
yeastyfoam. After the boys had looked at it- as
much as they cared to, and speculated. bout
treasure which theybelieved to be hidd nat its
léase, they continued on their way along the

ore.» . . - » ~
_J..“1I( wonder where Redriff went of! to?” said.

something to eat," said Joe. _; , V. ,

‘ “We're bound to meet him before long, forthis
island isn't so big. I see no reason why he should.

It’s about time that he let up.” ‘ _ '> 2—

was dotted with additional ﬂotsam coming shore-

 vmake a pot of coffee. Jack and Joe, during the
interval occupied with the_supper preparations,
 took a walk around the immediate neighborhood
, «to see whether there were any signs of the mate.
,.. ' ﬁiiinding there were not, they extended their walk
5., rte the beach where they had left Redriif. He
 _ i was not there. He had recoveredand gone off
_i V to meditate upon the revenge he intended to exact
(‘I 7 for the rough—house treatment he had experienced
at Jack’s hands. As the boys approached the
—- cabin on 'their=,ret1.irn the aroma of ﬁne ’coﬂ’ee
H ‘saluted their nostrils. V I
’“Do you smell that? It’s coffee,” cried Joe,
grabbing his friend by the arm. ~ g
._ “Yes, and the real article,_” answered Jack,
feeling as delighted as Joe at theprospect of
‘ having a cup of it. I _ i ‘
;- “We’ve struck a regular snap,” said Joe. “I
7 wouldn’t be surprised if we ﬁnd some kind of
meat on the table, though where it is to come
 from’ I cou‘ldn’t guess. Maybe we’ll have some
u,rﬁsh'. My! but I’m'hungry. The smell of -the
d ‘coffee makes me feel how fainished I am.”
: When they entered the cabin Joe nearly had ,a
’ (ﬁt when he saw the _tongue, and corned beef, and
crackers, together with baked yam, warmed over,
bread-fruit, bananas and half a cocoanut full. of
milk beside each plate. - V ‘
“Who’d‘think we were“on a lone island in the
; South Seas!” he cried. “Plates, knives and forks,
spoons, and all the delicacies of the season. Jack
 and I have certainly landed on our feet.”

 

  
 

   
  
 

came out of the wrecked schooner, “Golden Gate”:
. > “Elsie’s room is full, of the stuff we saved,
Vsaid the skipper. “There’s at least sin‘: months’
’ ‘supplies for the four of us. And there are clothes
enjough to keep us_well supplied with raiment
for a mucli_longer time.”

-,Joe certainly ﬁlled up on meat at supper, and
if he ate one cracker, he got away with a round

   
 

"dozen, not to speak of two cups of coifee, which,

he declared was the ﬁnest he had ever tasted.
‘Jack also, did justice to the substantial fare, and
felt like a new boy when the meal was over. It
"was dark by that time, and the boys helped Elsie
ash the dishes and tidy the living-room up. For
-that night at least it was arranged that the boys
would have to put up with a blanket apiece on
.,the~ﬂo.or. ‘ , ,_
‘ “We’l1 put up with anything to have a roof
over our heads," said Jack, cheerfully.

until the work was ﬁnishedpand then-_1t wa put
.:out, and all hands conversed together in the ark,

though it was not so very dark, for the sky was

ifhiilliant with stars and the air as clear as a bell.

‘ “By the way,” said Jack, “I-think that Joe and
‘I. ought to stand watch b turn. I think it more
‘than probable that Mark ltedriif will come prowl-

around here bent on mischief, and it wouldn’t ‘

Elsie left the room and presentl returned with " i ,_
two loaded revolvers which she lganded to Jack :

“When the mate'gets a sight of these popper; f 
he’ll give us a wide berth,” said Jack, with .3, » 1
feeling of satisfaction. “He made the mistake‘
of his life by cutting up rough here. Had*~h0,_'

‘humane principles, but it would have been ‘much — ;;

After awhile Jack brought up the subject again; " ‘ ~
of the treasure of Colﬁn Rock. y 2-. —
“Since we are here on the spot, Joe. and I are ' " ‘
going to search for it, even if nothing comes ‘of it.

is hidden somewhere about the rock, it will be 6 s an
source of satisfaction to prove, if possible, the » 

 

 

the mate of the'Golden Magnet. Heeven indi-" 
cated where he believed the place was on tho‘.

into my head to try and verify his story, or if‘ I-
did, that I would ﬁnd a chance to“ do so,” said

  

“You might as well employ your time that way‘ ‘jf *
“I have no‘ ’ ‘
great faith in your achieving any results, but still’
there is no telling but there might be something
in the yarn after all.” »-

“There is, generally a smoldering ﬁre where’

you see smoke,” replied Jack.

‘"‘'‘‘You’ll have_ to keep your weather eye _1ifting'.
for Redriﬂ’, for he claims to possess the secret of
the treasure, and will assuredly object to you

which can be reached at low tide by walking out‘
‘through a few inches of water, and then he is not
likel to come upon you unawares.” ,. -’

_ “ e’ll look out for him, captain," said Jack,‘
in a conﬁdent tone. ‘ ' —
Elsie now got up and said good-night to every?

The boys offered to help Elsie clean up after: '-
the meal, but the girl said sheﬁcould attend-to

outside‘ to consult about their plans for the 'day__.: ". .
“My idea,” ‘said Jac , “is to take’ the boat anﬁf‘.

a goodmany things that will be useful to us, 
no one can say how» long we may have to‘ remm "
on this island. Thebrig will break up und_er

" Splashing through the few inches of water he
“kept his eye on the dark spot he had noticed about

 :.right down on his knees in some twelve inches of

«J V. ‘ﬁnger over it, “and! thought it might prove a
‘clue to the—-good gracious!”
. , He had pressed hard upon the head of the seem-

him by the opening inward‘ of a cunningly con-

 closed noiselessly; and though the boy peered
~ closely he could not detect the outline of the door.
‘ ‘_‘Gréat -Christopher!” cried J act. “Yve struck
the treasure of Coffin Rock at last.” . '~ V '
. .,The boy caught his breath and stared hard at
the rock -so excited was heby his accidental dis-
covery of the secret. Of course, he was all eager-
V ?‘n,ess to see if the treasure was really inside of the
‘ ‘rock, and he looked down for the copper nail. It
seemed to have disappeared. That »-caused him to
gaspwith a kind of consternation, until he saw by
the position of the small, black patch, which was

   
   
  
  
   

 

 

' marine fungus which had adhered to the rock,
‘that the’ tide had-risen at least an inch since he
. ' came there. As the small copper—headed nail had
‘been on a level with the surface when he first
located it, naturally it was now 011t‘0f,sight' un-
der the water. i ,

‘Knowing retty near where it should be, Jack
 felt around or some moments in search of it. He
~,cou‘ldn’t tell it by the feel from the rock itself so
her-rkept pressing all around the spot. Suddenly
the secret door opened again.‘ ' As soon as he
released the spring it commenced ‘to close once
 more. ‘Jack placed the palm of his right hand
against it and held it open. The sun shining right
intojtlie opening illuminated the interior. What
'the‘depth of itvwas Jack ‘was unable to say,_as
fallhe could see was a layer of small fat—1ooking

how Joe’s eyes will open when he sees the coin!" ,
Thus speaking he hauled out six bags, one after; 9
another, and let them drop into the water in front}
of his knees. Then he released the door and"it»
shut to as noiselessly as before, leaving nota
crevice to tell of its existence. Reaching down
in the two feet of Water, Jack recovered the bag's,,;
but the six proved, small as they were, to be no;
light weight. With them in his arms he made-hisj
way to the beach, passed on through the line of,

I  The boys walked inside and found Ca tain
;  Howe sitting up with his game leg off the unk,
which showed it was ever so much better.
, “Captain, and ‘you, Miss Elsie, gaze on these
. bags and smack your lips. They're full of
money.”

“Full of money!” exclaimed the girl, in a tone
,of amazement, while her father stared at Jack
and the big bags. _

“Yes. This is a small portion of the ‘treasure
-, T of Coﬁin Rock,'whicli. I found this morning," re-

plied Jack.

The captain was dumbfounded. He could hard-
’, ly believe that the treasure. actually had existence
» in fact. To prove that it was no sham Jack cut
 “open one of the ba s at once, and a heap of
‘more or less worn gel pieces was revealed. After
_ that there was no longer any doubt about Jack's
discovery. All three were eager to learn the
full particulars of how he had found out the hid-
, ing-place of the treasure and whilethey ate break-
- fast he told them. Of course, Joe was eager to
-rush off to see the treasure trove. ‘
- .  ‘ "Hold your horses, Joe. It’s out of si ht under
", the water by this time. At the next eb we’ll go
7 * there and bring the whole treasure to the cabin,"
' ‘ said Jack. 
.So Joe had to curb his impatience.» The money
 the bags was counted and it was found that
 Coach bag held _just 150 golden coin, (the value of
_  fzwhich Captain Howe computed roughly at $10. At
9‘,-that estimate each bag held $1,500 and the six
‘V bags, $9,000. .
« “If there are ﬁfty bagsvmore, and all contain
ﬁeld, you’1l_be worth $80,000, Jack,” saidthe cap-
in. ‘ . ’ -
“It’s my opinion there are more than fifty bags
still in the hole,” replied the boy. —
Q , “Every additional bag will make you $1,500
‘ '- richer.” .
Jack, Joe and Elsie went down to the shore
V tolook at Coiiin Rock, which-now possessed a new
0 interest for them. The tide was wa up, so, of
course, nothing could be done towar getting at
the treasure. Jack ﬁgured that it would be down
‘;late in the afternoon, and he and Joe waited im-
patiently for the time to come. At ‘last the tide
, went out, and the boys were on hand with a couple
 ,of bags in which they intended to remove the

. treasure. Jack found the copper nail, as he called

' it, and pointed it out to‘ Joe. Pressing‘ it, the door
"~ , ﬂew open and revealed the interior to his friend.
 A‘few minutes later, Jack began taking out the
 bags with one hand and dumping them into the

1 daag" held by Joe while he kept the door back with
the other. There proved to be 100 bags alto-
‘.-igether‘, representing an estimated value of $150,-
000. Jack told Joe that he could have $25,000,
.and he presented $15,000 to Captain Howe and
W $10,000 to Elsie. .
, ‘‘,‘One hundred thousand is enough for me," he
said, with a cheerful laugh. 5 .

«ing that time Jack and Elsie grew very fond of
each other. Captain Howe saw how the wind
blew, and offered no opposition to the ‘course of
their love affair, so that in due time they became .
engaged with his consent. At the end of four; ._.:
months the party was taken off the island by a g:
vessel bound for San Francisco, and in due time. 1.-
they and the treasure reached the golden" city of 3.

" Many people,‘ despite court evidence of his
ouiitless ﬁnancial‘ frauds, still believe he _is the
champion of the under dog and has been per-
s cuted for being so. Bottomley, who‘ ‘was a

Doctor Prest commented on the, report. at  '
Charles A. Harnett, State Commissioner of Motor '“
Vehicles, to the effect that the recent inspection 
of 400,000 automobiles revealed the fact that-89 ‘ ‘
per cent. were mechanically defective. He said, 
that the owners and operators of these card’ a
should also be examined to determine their phyS- ',
ical ﬁtness and that if this was done the per- 7;.‘
centage of defects would be much higher. V r 
“A recent health examination of some 3,6011, ..

, closed a far more serious situation,?’ he continued. V 7

“Of these 3,600 children more than 63 per 

’ were found to have physical defects consider 

serious enough to require medical or dental at-_-_' '
