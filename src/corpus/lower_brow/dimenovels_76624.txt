NICK CARTER’S HANDICAP;

Victory Won in 21 Canter.

“And so, you see, Iystaild to lose twenty thousand

j7dollars.”
“That's a large sum.”

 “Yes, Mr. Carter, it's a large sum; but a middle-
’ aged gentleman like yourself ought to be aware that

risks are sometimes forced upon people who handle

' money in large sums.”y

The celebrated detective smiled as he looked into
the--excited countenance of the Wall street man be-
l_ Sore him. « ,

 detecttive»  just‘ returned from an expedi-

tion to the upper part of the city, during which he
had appeared as ‘a verdant country boy of an inquir-
ing turn of mind. '

“Of course." the detective said, slowly, “people
who handle money for the profit of others are ex-
pected to keep it in motion-—honestly in motion."

He glanced keenly into his visitor’s face as he
emphasized the last three words.

“;\Iy case is hardly what you suppose it to be,” said
Mr. James Wheeler, broker. “The money I handle
belongs to two heirs——both minors. With that, how-
ever, you have nothing to do.”

“You're mistaken,” said Nick Carter, coldly.
I am to handle your case I must have your fullest
conﬁdence." ’ '

“Regarding my present venture certainly, but I
fail tosee how past coinplicatiozis can interest you."

the children the money of which theyhad been

“And now they are likely to lose forty thousand
instead of twenty." i

“I'm afraid so.”

“What reason had you "for supposing when you
staked the nioneywthat Denver Bay would win the

" race ?”

“To tell the truth, I was half crazy when I made
the investment. In doing so I only followed the
drift of public opinion regarding the horse.”

“Did you make the bet in the regular poolroorn
way?-” ' ' i i‘ i
1‘ “Certainly not. The odds were two to one on
Denyzer Bayyandlno bookmaker would have taken

such chances so long before the race. The bet was V
made with a. downtown sporting man, for whom I

“His name ?”

“Peter Johnson." ~ ‘

“One of the most notorious racetrack ‘sharper: in
tlieeountry.” “ l

“I was not aware of that at the time.”

“We1l,’.’ said Nick, with a smile, “I never knew a
horse to win a raceﬂwith suchan outside bet on him,

NICK CARTER WEEKLY. 3

The place he entered was in a. basement, and was
foul, musty and suffocating.

The place was crowded with men and boys of high
and low degree, all hali crazed with the gambling
spirit.

The time was early in the afternoon.

From his position behind a large desk a tough-

looking clerk was drawling out the names of horses

with the odds which the proprietor of the place
would bet against them. -

It is generally supposed by the public that these
poolioorns merely conduct a commission business,
and that the odds offered there are the ones posted
at the racetrack.

But this is by no means the case. The proprietors
of the places bet according to their private ideas of
the proper odds. -T

The rustling of greenbacks and the elinking of
gold and silver were heard throughout the place as
the detective entered.

“The race in which Denver Bay is entered takes

place the day after to-marrow,” rnusedthe detect-

ive, “and I'll just see how he stands in this locality.”

“Say, podner,” he said, advancing toward a heav-
ily built man behind the railing, whom he knew to
be the proprietor, “what odds d’ye give on Denver
Bay?" '

“Guess you're (tom the West," was the answer.

“Right from the West, and any time you want to
know about the price 0’ cattle just drop a line to Sol
White at the Denver post office.”

“Denver Bay's from the West, too, ain't he ?".

“Yoda int he is, and he's a good little hoss. What i

odds wiilyou give me on him ?" i_ V
_ “The 35y don’-t eutlmueh on figure oh my books.

,j Nick Carter watched theface of the bookmaker as

was pleased to‘ get’ a bet even at such odds. _ _

“Don't give it away here,” said Nick, in a whis-
per. V ’

“I don't give nuthin’ away. I gets money fer
pointers-I does.” '

As he spoke he took the detective by the arm and
led him to the meanly furnished barroom in the rear
of the place.’

l‘I’ll jest tell you,” he said, as they stood at the bar
with liberal glasses of whisky before them, “that yer
want ter play dat hoss fer second place.”

“I’ve been playin’ him fer winner."

“Well, you jest take my tip, an’ go ahead on it.
'It’s all right.”

The detective paid for the drinks, and turned ,
away, but the other caught him ﬁercely by the arm. "

“Hold on here!" he said, ‘with an ugly» look. 

.. “That tip’ll cost you jest ten dollars."

l “I didn't ask you for no tip," said the assumed 

countryman, with a stare. , 3’
"Well, you got it just the same, on’ you'll get 
somethin’ else, too, if you don't cash up." 
“You won't get no ten dollars from me."

After a time two men, evidently none too sober,
entered the stall next to the one occupied by the de-
tective‘, and ordered more drinks.

“It’s a bloomin’ shame for a feller ter drop his
wad like that,” said one, in a maudlin tone, “specially
when he’: on de inside an‘ oug-hter know. But you
lost more’n I did, an’ I sympathize with you."

"I don't want none 0’ your sympathy," said the

other, evidently a little nearer sober than his com-

panion; “Yin broke now, but I can get plenty of
money when I get over to the stable."

“You're a liar! you're always workin’ that bluff
about the stable. You don’t get any more stuﬁ‘n I
do. Wot you got to do wid de stable, say P”

“W’at I got to do wid de stable?” said the other, in_

as sarcastic atone as he could command. “I’m

chambermaid for Denver Bay, I am.” A
;,“You're aniee than to be around a racing stable,"

said the other, with an oath. “Wpt do you know

about aehoss ?” ‘ ‘ .

Just at that moment the door of his stall was
opened, and akgreasy-looking jockey shoved his face
inside. '

“You don't mean ter say yotfre gain’ ter smoke

“Yes,” said the other ; “I understand. I wish I
hadn’t had anything to do with it. Have you got
any money? I'm broke.” ‘ ‘

“You won't drink any more to-night?”

“Not a drop.”

“Well, here's twenty-ﬁve dollars. I may not see
you again _till just before the race comes off."

“I believe,” said Amos, as he took the money,

"‘that Denver Bay would win that race if you’d let
‘him alone.”

“In that case it would cost my man just forty thou-
sand dollars.” ,

As Martin pissed out of the stall the ‘door was le

open for an instant, and Amos stood directly in front

of it, withithe greenbacks still in his hands.

“Where are you stopping?”

“’Most anywhere.” '

"Why not come over and stay with me to-night ?"
‘~‘Don’t mind if I do.” .

Nick was more than pleased at his good fortune in
getting within reach of the tricky sporting men’s
tool‘ so soon.

He suspected, however, that the man he was with
would be followed by his scheming employers {mm
that time until the race was over.

He was fully aware" that men who commit crimes
and engage others to assis_t them in their nefarious
work‘ never trust their tools implicitly.

His first idea. was to ascertain whether spies had-

actually been set upon his companion,

He also desired to know whether Chick was in a
position to be within ‘reach if needed.

In order to do all thisit was nccgssary far him to
leave Amos alone for at least a few moments,

“Look here,” he said, as théyawere starting up

He derives an immense income from his detective
work, and has no inclination to makea break for
sudden fortune.

In fact, were he worth as many millions as a Van-
derbilt or a Gould, he would still, for the very love
of the business,tbe a detective. n

have laid out for myself to-night we must separate

The man subsided, and Nick" shoved a ﬁft_v—dollar
bill toward the speaker.

“I'll take that bet," he said, coolly.

"All right,” said the player, taking out a roll of
bills. “Here's the money. Who'll hold the stakes?”

Nick called up one of the proprietors, stated the
bet, and put the moneyinto his hand.

“Now, then," said the other, with alsneer, “I'm not
used to betting against such odds, but I'll put up ten
thousand against a thousand that Denver Bay don't
win.” .

‘,‘I’m your huckleberry,3: said Nick, producing the
money. i . ,

“Of course, I haven't thegnoney with me, but I'll
put up a forfeit of a thousand against a hundred of
yours, and we’ll make the bet at ten o'clock in the

the last stage of intoxication.

Each time he paid the waiter from a large roll of
bills.

“Here’s a seat at the table, if you want to play,”
said a manbehind the roulette wheel.

“Guesh I’m too full t’ play; guesh I’ll go to the
hotel ’n’ go t’ bed,” said the man from Grand Rapids,
Michigan.

“You'll get run in if you go out on the street now.

Nick could hardly restrain a chuckle as he was led
away by the obliging darky.

‘;They don’t let any one out of here with a roll of
money like that,” he thought.

He was shown into‘ a small room containing a
couch, a mirror, and a small table.

As the negro left the room the detective heard .a‘
key turned in the lock.

Nick lost no time in making a close examination of
the apartment. E ’

He had sized up the negro careftilly, andin five
minutes he was a pretty good counterfeit of that sa-
bl: gentleman. . ~

A sound of voices now came faintly from the di-
rection opposite from the entrance to the room he
was in.

It was very indistinct, however; and, after a mo- .

meat’: inspection of the room beyond through the
keyhole, the detective applied his picklock, and soon

found himself in a small, dark room, from which he g

could hear the voices quite distinctly.

"I tell you it’: all right,” said a voice, with an oath.‘

"Well, it’: mighty strange that bets should» be

made his appearance at Nick Carter's private oﬂice.
He had tlieappearance of a man who had had a

hard night or it, but was still full of pluck. l‘

“Did everything go all right 2"’ Nick asked.‘

“Yes, I was reasonably successful.”

their voices to whispers whenever he came ne=3l' ,-
them.
L “This won’t do,” thought Nick. “I must ﬁnd out
what those fellows are talking about.”
Every effort to overhear them, however, failed,
and he ﬁnally gave it up. '
After a long talk, during which Nick saw some
money pass from the sport to his companion, the
former left the place.
“Well, Steve,” said one of the helpers about the a
saloon, “have you got any pointers about the race V
to~1-norrow ?” ' . l
“I can tell you about that to-morrow.” ‘
“Aw,” said the "dude, advancing toward thetwo i
men, “were you talking about the races, you know?" I
“That’s what,” said Steve, winking at his compan- ’
ion. “Do you want to rnake‘y_our everlastin’ £or- :
tune?” ” s
“Aw, ‘I might  up a couple of hundred." ~
“That's the cheese,” said Steve, with [another ,
wink. “I’ll bet you're a dead game sport.” a g
“It isn't good form to be a sport, donelier know.” _C
“You bet it ain't, but its good form to win money, 
poo . * ‘
Steve poked the dude slyly in the ribs as he spoke. 
g “All the boys bet, doncher know.” 3
“Well, you follow my steer, and you'll have a wad 3
big as yer head day after to-rnorrow.” , l_

“Aw," said Nick, as the fellow disappeared. “Just

the race had been more than hinted at when Chick

had appeared at the stables as at jockey on the pre-.

vious night.

His report on the matter that morning had caused
Nick to talk as he had at the broker’ 5 office.

From that conversation with Wheeler, every word.-
of which was still fresh in his mind, Nick had satisﬁed
himself that the broker was anxious to let the stake
remain if there was any prospect of securing a fair
race.

' This was one point in favor of the project of balk»
ing the rascals in their eﬁorts to keep the horse out.’

Another strong point in the mind of the detective
was to teach Johnson and his gang of criminal pool-

iseilers a salutary lesson.

“What the}; aimed at in their dealings with
VYheeler,” he mused, “was robbery, pure and sirn-
plé. They thought to take his twenty thousand doi-

it.” i i
“Well,”. said—»Morris, at length; “how much are
you going to put on Daisy?” V

Nick gave the required order, and the fellow took
down his whisky without seeing that Nick threw the
contents of his glass uf>on the ﬂoor-.

“Now, mind what I’ve told you,” said Morris, as
they stood ill the doorway, “and don’t give me away.
I shouldrft have said anything about it if it hadu’t
been for de whisky you throwed into me.” i
“ ’Pon me honah! I’ll not mention it to a living’
soul.” m &

As the two passed into the barroom the sound oi
excited voices came from the street in front of the
house. i 2 r,

Nick was now anxious to get away, but he paused
for a moment and listened as the sounds became
louder. , i

In a“ moment a small boy, clad in the costume of a
jockey, dashed inyat the from door and dodged be-
hind tables and chairs in his efforts to keep out of
the reach of ca red-faced fellow, who, riding w 7 in
hand, was pursuing hing. , T

The boy succeededigin eluding his pursucr for some
moments, much to the delight of the bystanders. b

At lexigth the little fellow, in leaping backward,
stumbled over ,a chair, and fell to the ﬂoor.

A few yards from the front of the house a young
boy in a jockey uniform was standing. J

The boy sprang nimbly into the vehicle.

Nick spoke the last word in a loud tone of voice,
and in response to the signal the. door swung open
and a bright light ﬂashed iiitoithe place.

.Behind the light was an ofﬁcer’s badge, and at the
right of the badge was a steady arm carrying a
cocked revolver. (
_ Before the two culprits could recover from their

 i astonishment or lift a hand, the cool voice in the ‘
 lg ‘ -darkness continued:
V (“You see how it is, gentlemen, two men have the
drop on you, so you may as well give in. ,
"Hold steady, there, Mr. Ofiicer, while I slip on
the bracelets.” . 
 Almost before the men could realize their true
, position, they were handcuffed and helpless.
_ “It’s just this way,” said Nick, still keeping in the
up a shadow, “nothing is to be said about your attempt to
e ylalame Denver Bay.” T ’ i
"wmm we arrested for then ?” gasped Brewer.
“For the larceny of twenty thousand dollars from
I Iames Wheeler’: oﬁice’  Wallstreet not ‘long ago.”

Thus talking, the men passed out of the room,
closing and locking the ‘door behind them. .

No sooner had they disappeared than there wasla
sudden upheaval of a long couch in one corner of the
room, and Nick Carter grept from underneath it.

"Whew !’l’:he said, drawing a long breath, and wip?
ing the perspiration‘ from his face, “I think I should "

V have died in there in ﬁve minutes more.”

The celebrated detective had, as a matter of fact,
been concealed in the nagrow space between the sofa:
bottom andthe ﬂoor for four long hours.

Early in ltheiday he had heard Martin engage the"
room, and give explicit orders that} no one should
be allowed to oceupy it duringthe day. ‘

.The coast was clear, and he lost no time in getting
outside and mingling. with the crowd.

, 5 V As he stepped albng the walk, he felt a touch upon
his arm, and turned to find Chick standing before
him, still in the disguise of a jgckey.

The two walked along together until they reached
a secluded place, and then Nick asked:

it .“Did you see the slieril¥?’.’ . -

"Yes. Everything is all right at the jail. Brower
and Morris are locked up in separate cells,‘ and no

The clerk in charge came out from beh' d the
prescription screen to wait upon him.
“I want a sugar pill,” said Nick, with a sm le.
The clerk reached out his hand and took own 8
jar of homeopathic pellets.
“Hold on,”_ said Nick, “those are too smal
sides they are medicated, are they not?”
“Nothing ‘but pure sugar,” said the clerk,
a few into his mouth and chewing them with
dent relish. , ' .
“That ain’t what I want,” said Nick, stepping?
around to the showcase, where a line of marbles and
toys were displayed. “I want one just about thesize

of one of those-marbles. It must be perfectly round 1

and smooth and hard. Can you make one?” i ,
“I certainly can.” _ 1
“Well, do so at once.” ,. J .

The clerk retired behind the screen, and in a few
minutes came out and; stood behind the counter fac-

ing the detective.

He‘ remained behind the rest, however, and
seemed to have some particular business with the
pocket of the vest he held in his hand.

“You're beat,” said one, as the runners reached
the comer.

“I guess I ain't no good,” said Nick, as Amos
came back. °

“Hello, there,” said Amos, all out of breath;
‘‘.you’re trying to put on my vest.”

“That’s so,” said Nick, with a wink. "It looks
a little newer than mine.”

Amos put on the garment, threw on his coat
and hastened to the rear end of the barn, where Nick
plainly saw him fumbling with a box which he had
taken from the vest pocket.

“You'll find a pill there, all right enough,” thought
Nick, as he walked away, “but not one calculated to
make a horse lose a race. In the meantime,” he
added, rolling a hard. round substance in his pocket,
"‘I’ll keep this and have it analyzed.”

A Wise Boy.
‘ iB_v Rose Grant, Ohio.'l

A lady in a Sunday school has a class of small boys.
Not long ago, after the lesson was over, as was her cus-
tom, she began to tell them something about God. This
time she chose-the power of God as her theme; she told
them how he turned the water into wine, opened the es
of the hlincl, made the lame walk and many oger

~ miracles illustrative of God's power, so one little boy from

way in the rear of the class steps up and says:

"Teacher. I know something that God can’t do."

“What is it?'i asked the teacher of the boy. “I cannot
conceive of anything that God cannot do.” ‘

‘..‘He can't make a three-year~old colt in one day.” and
‘the teacher was taken all aback with the knowledge of
‘her Sunday school scholar.
