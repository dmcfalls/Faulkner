Thus he never left the office, except on special’ _

When Phil entered the elevator it wanted ten-4

lightful that he was anxious to get there with as

he lived before supper time, for reasons that were .

Their. apartments ‘consisted of three rooms;-4}
two fair-sized ones, one of which did dutyfor a,_

larger than a good-sized closet. ;  5
Phil occupied the small room, which was just

 

’ large enough to hold a cot, with a narrow space at

the foot into which he hadhsqueezed a very smali
trunk. ‘ ‘- ' ‘ p 2

He and his stepfather didn’t get on well to-

to the man’s uncertain disposition. '

“Where have you been so long?” were the _

words that greeted his appearance in the living-
room' in the Sculler apartments. .

It was Mr. Sculler who spoke, and he was evi-
dently the worse for liquor, for he had ﬁnished

a "three-days’ job on a. ship that afternoon and ‘ —

celebrated his emancipation from labor by load-
ing up with bad whisky. Phil’s mother, who was
in the room, looked imploringly at him. The boy,
though he rebelled. at his stepfather’s remark,
smothered his feelings, and re lied:

“The boss sent me to Brook yn on an errand.

and I hadto return to the oﬂice with an answer."
The answer appeared to satisfy the longshorc-.
man, who sat back in his chair and puffed at his

pipe in a sulky way. Phil’s nriother dished uphis,

supper‘ and he sat down at the table in the cen-
tre of the room to eat it. Mr. Sculier was out

of sorts because after spending a portion of_his—’

4 “ Turning around he started back upstairs with
‘ blood in‘ his eye. He burst in on Phil and his
" mother while the ho was showing her the hand-
_ some necklace he ha found. The longshoreni ‘s
’ ,ﬂauiing eyes lighted on the ornament and e
‘ V ,.fafirly_gasped. He forgot all about the errand
' that had brought him upstairs. He wasn’t so
, drunk but he understood what it was his step-
’, ,son“ held in his hand, and though he had no
' idea of its value still the sparkle of the diamonds,
, as well as the sheen of the pearls, to.ld him that
I ,‘ the article could be pawned for money enough to
’ furiiish him withlashings of whisky. He rushed
forward and made a grab at the ornament. Phil,
‘ with an exclamation of surprise-and consterna-
, tion at his abrupt reappearance, snatched his
_ , ‘hand away. just in‘ time to defeat Mr.,Sculler’s

his purpose being to decoy Mr. Sculler around they '

end farthest from the door, and then take ad-
, yantage of the chance to leave the room.’ Sculler
 ,fe1l'i~nto the trap and started to chase him. The
 ‘excitement of the moment sent the fumes of the
/' liquor he had drunk to his head, and his sight,

 ‘over it himself. Unfortunately the lamp stood on

his anger against him returning.

’Phil waited to argue the matter with him no_

e min the footsteps of several ﬁremen. As they
rushed upstairsin the /burning building, drag-
“ ~ ging a hose with them,‘ he banged, his way into

 was deserted and Phil hurried into the_two rooms

 girl._ A lamp burned in the living-room, where
_‘ Monsieur Boutelle-had been reading when the

about ‘his property that he left behiIid.~ p

r " The morning papers had the story of the ﬁre,
which had gutted the two upper ﬂoors of the
tenement” and ruined the balance of the build-

_ ing ‘more or less. They also had an account of
 the assault and robbery of Moses Halle. Phil
read both stories when he reached the oil’-ice about
half-past nine. There was no “one in the place

._ when he arrived, but the janitor, whom he met
- in. the main corridor, told him that the station
3 detective would beat the office some time during
’ the morning. After reading about the two chief
‘U incidents in his experience, he turned to the lost
' and found notices, and in, one of the papers saw
the necklace advertised for. The reward offered
nearly took his breath away, for it was $2,000.
‘.‘.Lord, if I getthat I’ll be rolling in Wealth,”

, he said to himself. “And why shouldn’t I when

~ piit is offered? The ﬁnder is directed to call at

Tiﬁany’s. I’ll go there you can bet your life.

He continued to read the news and ﬁnally
came to a sma11'”pa«rag'raph announcing the arrest
of his stepfather the night before in a saloon
for being concerned in a brawl. This news \was
; a. surprise to him, but he was rather pleased
.-because the chances were that Sculler would be
 sent to the Island for six months. His enforced
“absence would, Phil thought, be of great ad-
vantage to himself and his mother,‘ though he
,didn’t doubt but she would sympathize with her
‘jworthless husband. About this time the door

opened and the detective walked in. ‘

'1 “I"see you’re here, young. man,” he said.

Your employer is reported to be in a pretty - r ;

I suppose so. Trouble never comes singly... 
However, I guess I’ll get_along,”_ replied Phil. 
thinking of the $2,000‘«reward that was .offered~y A
by'T1ﬁ‘any for the lost necklace. “Find any clue . V. .

"No, but I hope to round him up through the_ .

for he would hardly keep them here, except per- ’ 3

At that moment the door opened and a broker
came in. He was one of Mr. Halle“; customers,-‘l-‘.,»
and he wanted to learn later particulars about 
the money-lender than the newspapers gave. I Then ‘
detective gave him all the informationhe c.ou.ld.“..
Shortly after he went away Broker Hartley came .
in. The news of Mr. Halle’s misfortune shad, "

money-lender. a considerable sum which his

refused to accommodate him for some reason and i
demanded his money; He had till noon to ‘aka “ _

the Wall Street buildings.- V . *

“What’s the trouble?” he asked a bystander. 

“Some boy taken with a ﬁt—a messenger,gI 
guess,” was the reply. 4. " » ’ W 

At that moment an ambulance came dashing‘ up.
to the spot, and the surgeon leaped out and forced .;
his way through the crowd. Phil noticed a,..
‘smooth-faced man, very like the individual the‘.
had ‘seen in the restaurant with Dunstan Leach,“
fall in behind him and follow him. A policeman 

 

and in t e shuffle Phil found himself on the in-
e mob of spectators, and got a ‘clears

 

knew who was a messenger of a certain National
bank. One of his hands’ rested on a small,com«-"
pact bundle which he had "been carrying ‘when.
he fell down. ‘Phil saw the smooth—faced- man»
say something to the surgeon,Cwho was taking a;
blanket out of the ambulance which had been
driven close to the sidewalk and the boy. ~When ‘
the surgeon knelt down. beside the patient, the; _
smooth-faced man did the same, andraisedvthe 
boy ,a little’ so the doctor could put thefolded
blanket under his head. , _- , '- ,‘ 
After doing that he picked up the bundle from .I
under the'b0y’s hand and held it-while talking to-
the surgeon and making himself useful .one way,
or another. . Phil kept his eye on him, for some-;
thing struck\him that theifellow was not honest,
and that liis. purposewas to get away with. the}
bundle under the very eyes of the policeman ‘and
the crowd if he couldmanage it. . ' 0 -'
-“‘I’m sure that's the chap I saw with :Leach, and
I didn't like his face. I put him down as ‘a creole: ’
then, and I believe he-is. If he tries tomake ;

“Get out of my way!” snarled the fellow, glar-

“No, I won’t,” replied Phil, sturdily- “you,

"5_ ’ The altercation, of course, attracted the atten-

smooth-faced man,‘ seeing that his purpose had

CHAPTER X.—-Phil Corners the Crook. 1!

Great excitement immediately ensued. The mo-
merit Phil recovered from the shock of the blow
he shouted “Stop thief!”‘ and forcing a passage
for himself through the yielding spectators, start-
ed after the rascal.'The policeman, satisﬁed there
v  was something wrong about the man, from his ac-

; tions, started at Phil’s heels. H A part of ‘the crowd
i hardly understanding the merits of the case, but
 conﬁdent that the smooth-faced manvwas a thief
‘ because he had taken to his heels, joined in the hue

', and cry down¢Wall Street., The fugitive led by

, ' more than forty feet, as he’ had secured a good
5 (start; and though Phil soon cut down that dis-
  tance by a third, the man gained Pearl Street and
¥disap'p‘eared around the corner.

 

 

When Phil dashed around the corner at full”-~'

.’ {speed the smooth-faced man had disappeared.
I The boy kept on for ﬁfty,:feet and then stopped
,to’look around. He sprang on the narrow plat-
 form in front of the entrance to. a. wholesale es’-'
‘ tablishment to get a better view, but the thief
_ was not to beseen anywhere. ‘Pearl Street is not
‘over wide andis darkened by the elevated rail-
; giway structure overhead. .Moreover, it was ob-
‘ " structed by many trucks. ,The smooth-faced man
<_ had lots of points in his favor to block his ur-
“ " suers, and make his escape. He might be slin ing
M‘; along beside one of the trucks going south which
j " would shield him from observation. ,With Fthat
2 silica in his head Phil dashed across the way and
‘ . mounted one of the platforms on that side, but the
change did him no good. ‘There wasn’t any sign
0'f‘the'”thief anywhere. Phil bit his lips in vexe-
-‘''tion. , The policeman and -the crowd had also lost

and to go prying about in such a placewas to rnni 
every chance of. soiling one’s clothes. Such a con-,-f, _
sideration as that did not for a moment deter the 
resolute boy. He struck a match and looked“ g
around, never thinking that the barrels might, 3
contain oil, for they were greasy and dirty enough)  ..
to suggest such contents, or‘ some other ,inﬂa'1ri”->--g";
mable stuff.» He was a careful lad, however, and 
did not toss the expiring match recklessly aside’. 5
, His ﬁrst attempt revealed nothing but :;nere’.‘;;
barrels, s¢me piled sidewise in tiers. There was
only one passage through the cellar, and that was '~  j
in the middle. He lit a second match and ads .3
vancing cautiously glanced sharply from side  
side among the barrels that stood on end. Thereif '_
were lots of dark’ places where aman might hide L 
and escape casual observation. ~By the timehe »
reached the back of the cellar he had exhausted
half a‘ dozen matches without any result. "Then—he'
saw a door before him. Laying his hand on"t.he_,
knob it yielded to his touch. He opened it and
looked out ‘into a narrow yard; It- was littered’
with rubbish and dirt, and was shut ‘in by fan
tall brick walls. Although when Phil looked out
he had no expectation of seeing his man, yet lther
he was, seated carelessly on ‘an-old box, smoking a
cigarette‘, with the air of a, person thoroughly at;
ease. The packagenlay on the box beside him, and‘
hewas looking at the ‘ground.as  he saw so_ es
thing of interest there. The opening of the 
and Ph1l’.s step caused him to look up quicklyggandr
he laid one hand on ‘the package.  
“Well,” said Phil, with a thrill of satisfactio‘n,1T
“I see you’re here.” ',
“What do you want?” the man said, with a ‘note.

“You’re talking through your hat,” he'*a'n-

,~j the boy he would be caug t. Prompt action alone

~ would avail him. He must get,by the boy and
try. to escape to the street. He put hls hand to

. jPhi1, however, was watching every move he n‘oa._de,
knowing that the man was a tough proposition
: for him to handle. The moment he saw his hand
go to his back pocket he suspected his _obJect and
 ‘sprang at him. The revolver ﬂashed in the air,
: but before he could use it Phil grabbed the wrist

of the hand that held it. _
” -“Let go, blame you!” snarled the crook, stnk-
" .ing at Phil /with his left ﬁst.

‘ 'The' boy dodged the blow and wrenched the fel-
, Iow’s wrist with both hands so sharply that‘ he
"cried out, and struck at Phil again, this time
"landing on the back of his head a glancing blow.

The crook was staggered,'and half doubled up with
f a groan. Phil took advantage of his chance and

Wmenched the revolver fromdiis ﬁngers. ;,
 “Now,” he said, picking up thepackage which
9 the fellow had dropped, and backing away, . you
might-asewell give in for you haven’t got. the
Vghostof a show.” /_ .  _
To ‘attract attention the boy ﬁred the pistol
., twice in the air. Faces immediately appeared at

the windows of the story above the basement, and
one of the sashes was thrown up.

Phil. ,“I’ve got a crook cornered. _He' stole a

' While speaking Phil held the rascal at bay ‘Wlth

that Leach had ‘written that he expectedto reap
turn to New York shortly. In next. morning’s=’
‘ paper Phil was surprised to read» 9., story from;
Chicago which stated that Dunstan Leach hagit
been arrested in that city in -onnection with -th,_;
Halle case. Detective Maguire, who it appeare V,‘
had followed him out West, had nabbed him in’ ac
brokerage house while negotiating the sale of tw,
$1,000 gold ﬁve fer cent. first mortgage Jerse
Central Railroad bonds. The detective claimed.
that the bonds were .part‘= of the loot taken, from’
Mr. Halle’s safe. Phil wondered.how Maguire‘
knew that, as the money-lender's books didn't;
show what collateral, if any, was in the safe at
the time of the crime. As soon as Phil reached!‘
the oﬂice he rang up Mrs. Bonne on-the ’-phon I
and told her what he had read in .the paper a-bou

xv

 

“My gracious!” she exclaimed, evirfently. a_ 
upset by the news. “What paper was it in '1” .
Phil mentioned the paper he had read the story —

in. ~ ~ .

“I Mt imagine how the detective could know“
that the bonds in question were taken from.m_y
brother’s safe. I haven’t been able to find" tliei‘
least clue to what was in the safe.’ All theses
curities held by Mr. Halle either as an invest

‘ ment, orfor his customers, appearto be in th"
safe deposit box. .The manager and I went‘ oye
the contents of the box, and compared the securi
ties With~the list you made up from the b00l_<Ss~
There was nothing missing.” ‘ '_ V ’ - _~,'

“Mr. Halle may have bought those two bond
on the day he was attacked and had them tent
porarily in the safe,” replied Phil, .  ‘ /, '

."That’s true. I didn’t want to ‘liave‘Dunstan
arrested even if .he was shown to be guilty. ‘ '
fact that he was trying to sell those particular’
bonds in Chicago is not posi_tive'evidence that ‘_h,
got them from my brother’s safe’? I _ “I , , 0

“N o. In order to get .a magistrateitc hold him
the detective will have toshow beyond a 're“as,on;,
able doubt that the bonds belonged to Mr. "Halle.-’
I don’t see how he is going -.;o'do it.” ' . .
_ “Nor I. If he should be held I suppose. the
detective will bring him to New York”. -.

“If your nephew refuses 'co_,come of..his _oW;i
accord extradition papers. will, have to be taken
out, and the gov_ernor,’will require evidence ‘-that
shows Leach"s guilt, before he'll sign the docu
ments.” , . ' " .

 I C I  Seven‘ I Thousand Dollar
 I‘ it Check

_' On Tuesday,‘ Dec. 10, 1872, I paid my first
, "Visit to New York City, a visit which I shall not
. soon forget, for reasons which I will proceed to
3 make known.
I I‘was then a clerk in the employ of Clayton &
Brodt, ’wholesa1e woolen merchants of Chicago;
 visit to this city was on business for their
ﬁrm. I was commissioned ‘to collect, if possible, a
bill of over seven thousand dollars, due from a
,; New York merchant, who had persistently ig-
: V. _ nored all letters which had been sent him on the
subject, and who, it was believed, was about to
become a bankrupt. The ﬁrst had directed me to
‘spare no effort to collect the money, as the loss of
. ‘it would be a serious blow to them; and I keenly
felt the responsibility of my osition. I went to
the merchant’s oﬂ‘ice prepare for battle; but to
my surprise and gratiﬁcation the gentleman at
, once handed me a check for the sum, with many
I apologies for hisdelay in remitting- Of course,
9 “II was h’ighly elated atm success.
‘ * The next morning as sat in my room in the

 
 

‘L .

 

 

. paper and awaiting the hour when it would be

 necessary to leavefor the 10:20 train, on which I

_ " was to return to Chicago, a knock sounded on the

lllllgaome in,” I cried.

I To my surprise Mr. Lucius Brodt, the junior
'. partner of the firm of -Clayton & Brodt, entered.

- V; “Well, Graham,” he said, throwing himself into
. a chair, “how are you.” _ , . _

,. -, “VI-n first-rate condition, sir,” I replied. “I did

_ np‘tIiexpect'to]§ee you): h . 9"

 A. g “I  id you,get t is money.

, “Good enougli!”.he exclaimed. ‘5I didn’t think
you would: You have it about you, of course?”

. ’.‘‘It is safe in my pocket-book.”

« '‘‘I’ll take it.” . _’ ’

 “I handed him the check without replying. He

I lit it in his vest pocket, and immediately rose to’

is feet.
“Da—da, Graham, till

 
  
 
 
   

 

 
    
    
  
   
  
 

., ‘‘I’m off now,” he said.
we meet again.”

which I did not until afterward understand. As
he put his handupon the knob of the door there
came a quick, sudden knock.

, Brodt started‘ back as if he had been shot, and
,I noticed‘ that his hand swiftly sought an inside
, pocket, where I knew he carried /a revolver,» He
fturned to me,'his face, as white as a-,-sheet, and
' asked in__a husky‘ voice: . A .. ' ’
