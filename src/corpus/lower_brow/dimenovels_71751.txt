on the‘ street Will pointed him out to Jack, and

hiscompanion many questions about stock mar-

saw of the financial dis-trictsthe more interested’

A -it he became.‘ Thebrokers seemed to be a

was presented to Jack" when he and Will visited

CHAPTER VI.——Jack’s First Venture in Stocks.

The late edition of the afternooirpapers had
the story of the safe accident on Broad street, and
Jack Holland was rated as/'3 hero of the ﬁrst
magnitude; On their way to the Broadway car
Dick and his chum as usual bought their evening
papers. Dick was the first to notice the account
of the affair printed under a big scare head.

. ~ “Howling dervishes!” exclaimed DlCl{,‘SllddBHl)',
as his bulging eyes read the Words that detailed
the thrilling rescue of old Mr.,Lee Richardson, a
retired stock‘-broker, by Jack Holland, a mes-

« 'senger employed by Howard Golding, No. —
".Wall Street.

“What does this mean?” _
. “What’s the matter?” grinned Jack, wh_o easily
understood the causepf his chum’s astonishment.
' “Say, is this you, or am I dreaming?”
Jack chuckled.
“Did you. actually save that old gentleman from
being mashed into a pulp by that_safe‘.7”
“I guess I did,” adm1tted.h1s friend.
Dick
alfair f fer, so he said no more and contentﬁd

their boarding-house several of Mrs. B1ake’s

I ' boarders had read the story. After he and Dick

got back to their room, Jack told ‘his chum about
the Masonic charm he had found In the_gutt.er In

I’.  front of Morgan’s Bank.

“It belonged to George Sangree, the broker, and

H ' I returned it to him.”

' “How did you ﬁnd out that it was his proper-
ty?’.’ asked Dick. . ‘

' “Mr. Golding recognized it.” _ _

, “Did he give you anythingfor recovering it?”
' “Yes. He gave me this.check,” repled Jack.

, “Three hundred dollars!” exclaimed his friend.
“Gee whiz!” ,
‘ “Mr. Sangree said the charm IS worth $900. and

 that he-wo'uldn’t have lost it for good for twice
A that amount.” ‘

“You’re lucky. What are you going to do with’

. “We1l,'l.’ll tell you. .I’m gding to soak it right

that Jack didn’t want to discuss the‘

OF F_‘“R'l‘UNE it ' 

“l’m not supposing any such thing.”

,,“But it is just as likely to go back two or three ,

' points as it is to advance.” -
“I don’t think so. At any_ rate, I’m going to
take the risk.”

“You wouldn’t catch meiputting $290'.up on’

stocks. I'm‘ no chump.” . '
“Then you think I’m a chump, do you?”
‘«‘I think you’re foolish. Three hundred dollars

is a lot of money. If I had it I’d hold on to it with ~

a double copper-fastened grip.”
“Nothing ventured nothing gained, Dickie."
“Ho! That's the principle that brings so many
lambs topthe Wal1,Street slaughter-house.’.’

“Well, I’m willing to be a lamb for once at any I

rate,” Jack remarked laughingly.
“L hope you won’t lose your ﬂeece, old fellow,"

grinned Dick; “but I have my doubts about it.”
“As. long as it isn’t your ﬂeece, don’t worry.’-’

Of course by‘ next morning every broker in the 1

district had. read about the safe incident, and per-

haps ﬁfty of them found some excuse to call at‘

Howard Golding’s office in order to catch a look
at the boy who had shown such courage. Several
of these brokers knew Jack either personally or
by sight, and they shook hands with him and said
very nicethings to him. Mr. Golding was also
buttonholed a hundred times that day and con-
gratulated on'having such a boy in his employ.

“Why, Jack,” he said, when he returned from
the.Exchange,, “you have made yourself quite 
conspicuous personage in'Wall Street. Everybody
seems to be talking about you to-clay.”

“That’s what a fellow is up against when he gets
his name in the newspapers,” replied Jack.‘

“One of the penalties of fame,” smiled the
broker. '

“Well, sir, I have one satisfaction. People will ‘i

forget all about me and the safe affair in a day
or tw-o. " - . A ’
When Jack returned to the reception—room he
found a gentleman waiting there to see him. It
-was Mr.” Lawrence Richardson, the son of the old
gentleman whose life he had saved the day pre-
vious.‘/ Mr. Richardson was .a well-known broker
whose‘ ofﬁce was in the New York Building. He

not only expressed gratitude to ‘the boy in feel-

ing terms, but he presented him‘ with an elegant
gold ‘Watch and chain as an evidence of his; ap-
preciation of the priceless service'Jack had rend-
ered him and his family. ' .

“Neither father nor I will ever forget whatlyou
have done for us,”. he said. as he prepared to take
his departure. “Now you must call and see us at
our home. We live at No. —- Madison avenue.
When shall‘, we look for you? Can you call»Sun-
day and take dinner with us?” '

Jack said he would be happy to do so.

“Very well. We shall expect to see you on Sun-
day at three. My father is suffering from the
shock to his system to—day, but I guess he’ll be all
right in a day or so.” .

With these words Mr. Richardson shook hands
with Jack and went away. The boy then asked
Mr Golding if he could go out on a little business
matter of his own which wouldinot take himvlong,

and having obtained permission-’ to do so, he ran’

around to a little bank in Nassau streetjhat made

a specialty.of buying and selling stocks for its »
‘ customers and others, and asked the margin clerk _

A FAVORITE

‘The lavatory door was unlocked and Higgins
found himself conﬁonted by threeyuniformed of-
ficers of the law. Resistance was useless, so he
yielded to the inevitable. The unconscious More-

‘land was picked up and carried to the sidewalk,

where a patrol wagon was waiting to receive the
prisoners. Jack took charge of the valise con-
taining the gold which had been in the small safe,
and accompanied the party to the station, after
locking up the oﬁice. He had already notiﬁed Mr.
Golding and Mr. Day, the cashier, by telephone.
and expected they would both be downtown before
long. Jack told his story to the sergeant of the
Old Slip station, the prisoners were locked up,
and then the boy returned with the satchel to the
oﬁice under the protection of apoliceman. It
wasn't long before the cashier turned up, and he
was aghast at the havoc done by the two crooks.
His anxiety was allayed when Jack showed him
the gold in the valise and assured him that he
felt sure not a dollar was missing. While they
were looking at the wreck of the small safe, Mr.
Golding made his appearance, and he, too, was
shocked at the condition of his office. Jack then
told his story all over again, down to the minutest
detail, and both gentlemen - raised him for the
nerve he had displayed un er very trying cir-
Before Mr. Golding went home he
resented his young; messenger with his check
or $1,000 and raised his wages to $10 per week.
Jack 'had to appear at the Tombs Police Court
next afternoon against William Higgins and Ed-

” ward Moreland, and on his evidence they were

held for the grand jury. As these persons do not
ﬁgure again in our story we will say right here
that a true bill for burglary was found against
them, they were duly tried,’ convicted and sent

"to Sing Sing prison for a long term of years,

where they still are at this writing and will re-
main for many years yet. The ten $1,000 C. R.

I. & P. bonds which ﬁgure in this case were found .

to have been stolen from the residence ‘of a

' wealthy Montclair resident, and were upon identi-
‘ﬁcation returned to him.

He sent Jack a check
for $250 in recognition of the ‘part he played in
the matter, which had resulted in the recovery of
the stolen bonds. If Dick had thought his chum

 ' , something above the common after the safe affair,

he now took his hat off to him as a kind of
phenomenon, and he considered the honor of hav-
mg Jack for his chum and roommate very great

' , indeed. .0ld Lee Richardson came downtown es-

cially to call on Jack after he read about the
urglary in the morning papers, and he said some
very nice things to the boy, at the same time
urging him to call at their home as soon as he
could ﬁnd it convenient to do so. Jack was more
than willing to oblige the old gentleman in this
articular, as he was somewhat eager to meet
iss Daisy Richardson once more, so he promised
to call on the following Sunday evening. After

Nobody, however, who owned any A. & P. stock

price, to 80, at which ﬁgure a few shares ex-

command_ was ready to add to his holdings if he
could have got it at 75 or under, but he soon
found that he’d have to pay a high ﬁgure or go
without any additional shares,‘ so he quit trying.

When the Exchange closed for the day he was
over $7,000 to the good on his 500 bunch, which
showed that A. & P. had advanced fourteen points
since the previous day. . ‘

The stock opened at 83 3-8 next morning and
advanced with a rush up to 90, at which point so
much of the stock changed hands that the price
did not go higher than 92 for the rest of the day.

Next day was Saturday and the bigh-water 

mark of A. & P. up to noon was 95. ‘

‘‘It’s too bad we’re not in this thing,” said Dick,
as he and Jack took a car for Twenty-third street
after they had lunched.

“You mean A. & P.?”

“Sure. . What else should I mean?”

“Well, I’m in it to the tune of 500 shares, if you
want to know.”

“Five hundred shares!” cried Dick. “When did
you get them and what did you pay for them?”

_“I got the shares the day Higgins and Moreland
tried to clean out our office, and I paid 68 for

‘ them.”

“Sixty-eight, and it is now ruling at 95. Why,
you’ll make a mint of money. How came you to
buy that stock? It seemed to be going begging
on Wednesday, and yet on Thursday morning,
after the news of the consolidation had been con--
ﬁri‘-ned,_ you could not ﬁnd a share in sight."

_ I wish an idea like ‘that would strike me once
in a while. I might make a haul, too.
over $13,000 ahead at this point.”

::I guess I ain,\” replied Jack, nonchalantly.

You take,it quite coolly, Jack. If I was in
your shoes Id be clean off my nut with excite-
ment. Ifyou had cashed in at present ﬁgures
how much would you be _worth altogether now?"

“H'ow_much? Something over $18,000.”

tell any lie when she said you were a favorite of

“Ix expect to, or go broke trying to get there,""

laughed Jack. ’

On the following Tuesday A. & P. reachal 103,
and as that gave Jack a proﬁt of $35 a share he
ordered his 500 shares sold. —*

After deducting commission and the interest
on the money advanced by the bank to carry the
deal for him for less than a week, he found he
had cleared about $17,000. Taken altogether it
was a lucky deal, and raised his capital to $22,000.

“I’m looking for some for future delivery. I'll
tell you what I’ll do with you, Golding. It's worth
85 to-day. I'll give you 88 for 2,000 shares at ten
days."

“You must have an idea that D. & H. is going
to rise soon,” laughed Golding.

A “Ihave. That's why I want to secure an option
on it."

Mr. Golding looked up the previous day's quo-
tations and saw that D. & H. had dropped from
85 3-5 to 85. He didn't care, much for selling an
option on so large a number of shares, but still
there was a chance that the stock would, go still
lower in the next few days, which would enable
him to buy it in for even less than 85, and give
him a good proﬁt on the transaction. 4

“I'll sell you an option on 10,000 shares at
88 1-2," said Golding, turning‘ again to his visitor.

“I want 20,000 shares."

“Well, I'll give you the call on 20,000 at 90. ‘

What do you say?” .
“No, you won’t," replied Blum. “The most I'll
Mr. Golding considered. '

“I'll split the difference between your original
oﬂ’er and mine, and make it 89. That’s the best
I'll do.” A

Blum haggled over the matter, but Golding was

rm.

“Well,” said Blum, ﬁnally, “how much deposit
do you want?” ’

“Five per cent. on the current value of the
stock.” '

.Blum agreed to pay that, and between them
‘they ﬁgured the thing out.

“Twenty thousand at 85 comes to $1,700,000,”
said Blum. “Five per cent of that is $85,000. You
write the 0 tion while I draw my check for the
amount of eposit.”

‘It was soon done, and ‘Broker Blum left the

I office with Golding's ten-day option in his pocket.

That morning Jack had been sent to a Brooklyn
bonded warehouse on an errand, and was return-

ing on a ferryboat. Curiosity to see the engine-
room had taken him into the center of the boat,

but much to his disappointment he had found the‘

door closed, and he started to work his way
toward the front of the boat around the many
wagons which ﬁlled up the space. Finally he
wa's brought to a halt by a small wagon blocking
up his path at a certain point, and while looking

I »for a way out of the difficulty he overheard two‘

persons conversing about the stock market.

It was hardly the right thing for him to stop
and listen, and he probably would not have done
so, but he heard Golding’s name mentioned in :1
way that seemed to mean that gentleman no good,

 so he thought it was his duty to ﬁnd out what

was in the wind, especially as one of the speakers
I \ addressed the other as Washburn. Jack knew well
' . enough that Washburn was down on his_ employer

like _a thousand_bricks, and his_ curiosity was im-
mediately excited to learn what he had to say-

" against Mr. Golding. V
 _ “How many shares of D. & H. are aﬂoat, do
" you think?” Washburn asked of his, companion.
, “About 40,000, and most of. it is held intbe,

G. where the hair is short.” . ,

“There are six of us in this scheme,” said Wash— ‘
burn’s companion, “including Blum, who is just
as eager as any of us to scalp Golding, because
Golding squeezed him once to the tune of -$38,000.
and I guess we can raise enough money to work
this game all right.”

“Don't worry about money,” replied Washburn.
“I've got Bunker in with us, and besides the
hundred thousand he has agreed to put up he’s
good to loan-us all the funds we may need to
carry the stock. We'll force the shares way above
par, and when we’ve got ’em as high as they will
go inside of ten days‘, Blum will call on Golding
for the stock. He won’t be able to deliver. it, be_.-*
cause we will have scooped in the bulk of it, and
then we'll be in a position to dectate terms. We
mustn't give him any quarter whatever.‘If we
can only drive him out of the Street it would be
an immense satisfaction to me, Saunders," said " 
Washburn, vindictively.

Saunders expressed the same opinion, andthen
the two bankers moved out of Jack's hearing-

“So that's the game they’rc _up to, is it?” mut-O
tered the boy, as he began to edge his way» from
behind a big express wagon. “I must put \Mr,
Goldi _ on his guard so that he won’t sell an
option on D. & H. to Mr.’ Blum, or anybody else
looking for his ﬂeece.” ..

When Jack reached-the oﬁice he found that Mr.
Golding had gone to the Exchange. He decided
to -run over and see his employer lest Blum should
meet him in the meahwhile and get. the option.‘
from him, according to the plans of the conspir-
ators. Accordingly, lie'rushed over to the New
street entrance and sent an attache out on the ﬂoor
to huntup his boss. ° ‘

“I want to see youa moment on very important
business, sir," said Jack, when Mr. Golding came ‘ J .t
over to the railing. , - _ . 

“What is it?” asked»-the broker.‘ « —
“Will you step outside so that I can talk without
interruption.” _, - . ‘

Mr. Golding, in some surprise, followed him to
a vacant corner. ‘

“I_ am ready to listen to‘ you, Jack,” he said,
looking ﬁxedly at the boy. _' , - .

Jack immediately told him about the‘convers'a-' 
tion he ‘had overheard between Washburn and
Saunders on the ferry boat. The broker was’ clear- 1
ly startled. _ » _

“I guess_it won’t be safe for you to give Mr.
Blum that option. What do you think, sir?" asked
the boy, eagerly. ' - , . ,.

f‘I'm sorry I_didn’t_know this an-hour ago,” re- '
plied Mr. Goldingpwlth some anxiety in his tone.

“Will it make any difference with on?" . - ‘

money, won’t you?”

“I think now» that you have warned me so soon
that I shall be able to secure the stock. Had this
matter been delayed a few days I should probably
have had to face absolute ruin. Jack, I shan’t
forget you in this matter.” *

“That’s all right, sir. I hope I have been able
to put you on your guard in time.”

Mr. Golding, however, found that it was not easy
to get 20,000 shares of D. & H. "All he succeeded
in buying before the Exchange closed for the day
was 10,000, most of which he got at 85 and 86,

but the last 2,000 shares cost him 88. The pros-.
pect was that he would have to pay very much.

higher for any more that he succeeded in unearth-
’ ing. In the meanwhile Jack returned to the
office and began to ponder over the case.

“I’ll just run over and ask Mr. Richardson if he
knows anybody that has some of that stock. Per-
haps he has some himself.”

So he put on his hat, told Mr. Day that he was

going out on business for Mr. Golding, and hurried ‘

down to the New York Building. Mr. Richardson
was in, and Jack asked him the important ques-
tion.

“Well, Jack, I haven't any of the stock myself,
but my father has a block of 15,000 shares-, which
I think he will sell. Wait a moment till I ’phone
to the house.”

~ In a few minutes Mr. Richardson came back
and said:

“You can tell Mr. Golding he can have the block
for 86, if he takes it right gzway.” ' ‘

“All right,” replied Jack, thanking him.

He ‘ran over to the Exchange, but Mr. Golding
had gone off to see a broker whom he had heard
had some of the stock he wanted, and so Jack had
to return to the oﬂice without seeing him. Looking
on the ticker, the boy saw that D. & H. was last
quoted at 85 7-8, and fearing it would go above

 86, he came to a sudden resolution that he would
buy the 15,000 shares himself on a ten per cent.
Lmargin, if Mr. Richardson would let him have
; , -them that way. He ﬁgured out thatlit would cost
‘ v him $129,000 to swing the deal, so he went to his
‘ safe deposit box and took out all his money but
$3,000, and carried it around to Mr. Richardson's
oﬂice. Mr. Richardson was out, but he asked per-
, mission to telephone to the old gentleman at the
 house. Jack caught him on the wire and told him
that he wanted to buy the stock himself on a ten
 per cent, margin, and was prepared to put up the
— necessary $129,000. .

 

“You mean you want to buy them for Mr. Goldv

/V ing isn’t that it?” replied Mr. Lee Richardson.
' “No, sir. I want the stock myself.” -'
Mr. Richardson the elder seemed to be greatly
astonished.
“Do you want me to carry this deal for you so
" you caneimake a proﬁt? If You '50 I Will <10 80. for
"011 have done‘ me a favor worth more ‘than

thought you objected to anythingof that kind”,
 "I am not asking for ,a favor, Mr. Richardson,
otherwise than that you will sell me your stock on

Mr. Richardson immediately concluded tnatths
boy was using Mr. Golding’s money, and'that Mr.
Golding didn’t want to be identiﬁed with the trans.
action, so he told Jack he could have tlie stock on
his terms, and asked him to send the cashiertothe
’phone. Ten minutes later Jack had a memoran-

~ dum which stated that he had bought the 15,000

shares for his own account for the sum‘ of
$129,000 on account, and that the stock would be
delivered to him on payment of the balance, to-
gether ‘with interest on same for as many days as
the stock was held subject to his order. He was
also liable for $3,750 in commission to. Mr. Law—
rence, Richardson. With‘, the paper in his po ket
Jack returned to the office, satisﬁed that he w uld
be able to loan his employer enough stock to make
up any shortage he was unable to fill himself.-
Jack put the memorandum in an evelope, and
placed it away in the safe, without saying any-
thing to Mr. Golding about it.

“I shall make a good thing out of this, for the
clique will force up the price -as high as they can
make it go inside of ten days. I;f.Mr. Golding gets
all the shares he needs I’1l sell out by degrees to
Washburn and his friends, and they’ll have to
take it in to sustain the price. If Mr. Golding

fails to get all he wants I’ll try to break the '

market and do up Washburn and others by dump--
ing the whole block on the Exchange at once.”
Evidently Jack Holland had a great head.

CHAPTER XVI.—A Favorite of Fortune. ‘

The clique had already begun to buy D. & I-I.
wherever they could get it, and Mr..Golding had a
great deal of difficulty in getting even 5,000 more
shares with the next two days.
shares cost him 95, and then he was up against it
for fair. Attention had now beencalled to the
stock and the brokers were astonished at its
scarcity, and the rapidity with which it advanced
in price. . When the Exchange closed on Saturday '
two brokers working in Mr. Golding’s interests

‘had both bid 102 for any part of 5,000 shares,» ,

without results. The broker ,-called Jack into his
office when he ca.nie.back from the Exchange. .
“I've 201: 15,000 shares, but the other 5,000 I
can't get for love or money. I’m afraid I won’t
be able to deliver them when I’m‘ called upon for
them; then Washburn will put the screws on me.”

“I wouldn’t worry if I were you, sir," replied
Jack, cheerfully. , »
“How can I help it when it seems al ‘st a fare.

“HOW high do you think ‘they will be able?to

';Well, sir, I can let you have 5,000 shares.”

“Jack Holland, what kind of talk are you giving
me?” asked Mr. Golding, severely.

“Nothing that I can’t prove. Excuse me a mo-
ment, sir,”

Jack went; out to the safe and got the envelope
containing the memorandum of his deal for 15,000
shares of D.«\ & H.» with Lee Richardson. He
brought it into the private office and showed it to
his employer. Mr. Golding gazed at it in a dum-
founded way. '

“Will you tell me what all this means, Jack?”

“Yes, sir; but it’s quite a story.”

Jack then gave his boss a history of his trans-
actions on the market, commencing with his first
little plunge on -50 shares of D. & E., with the
proceeds of Mr. Sangree’s check for $300, down
to his deal of 4,000 shares in D.  & N., on which
he had cleared $100.000.

“I had $132,000 in my safe deposit box the
day you gave Blum that option. I used‘ $129,000
of it to secure these 15,000 shares, thinking you

‘ might get stuck, and that I could help you out. I

’will lend you the 5,000 shares you are short, and
then you will be safe; the rest I will sell at high-
water mark before your option expires, and l

-rather guess Washburn and his friends will take

them in to prevent you from doing so.”

The whole thing was now clear to the broker,
and he regarded his messenger with eyes of
wonder. Undoubtedly Jack had proved himself
the smartest boy by long odds that Mr. Golding

had ever heard of in the whole course of his busi- 

ness career.

“Jack Holland, you are a ‘boy in a million. You’ll
be famous some day as a man, as you are some-
what celebrated in the Street as a boy for your
courage and coolness in emergencies. Now, ‘let us
talk business. I'll buy those 5,000 shares from

ou at the present market price, which is 102.
‘hat will give you a proﬁt on them of $16 a
share, or $80,000.” ,
' “No, sir. ,I don’t want to make a proﬁt on you.
I did not put the deal through for that object,”
replied Jack earnestly. “You will lose enough as
it is.. Besides, I will be able to make a big _proﬁt

’ _ out of the other 10,000 shares.”

‘ “Wait a moment, and let me ﬁgure this thing

" out to date, and I will show you how I stand,”

said the broker, drawing a pad toward him. “I
will include your 5,000 shares at 102.”

Then-Mr. Golding» pushed a paper toward Jack.

. This is what the boy saw:

20,000 shares, various prices .......... .. $1,830,000
Less 20,000 at 89_ (option price).... 1,780,000

Actual loss ......... ..; .................  $50,000

“The 20,000 shares will cost me together $1,830,- ~
‘ 000.

When Blum calls for the delivery of the
stockhe will have to -hand me his check for
$1,780,000, less the $85,000 he put up on deposit.
I’ will, therefore, only lose $50,000. ,_I...can easily

I i stand that, and it will ‘be a lesson for _me_ in the
I future. to be cautious about selling options,” said

Mr. Golding. . _

“Thank you, sir,” replied Jack. _ -

= “Now, for my own satisfaction as well as your
proﬁt, I am going to help you turn the tab1es.on

think they already see my scalp dangling in their . 
wigwams. On Monday I will give you my check 
for the amount necessary to take over the whole
15,000 shares from Mr. Richardson. I can raise
the cashvon securtites I possess, and what I fall
snort I will borrow on call. We will then watch
our chance and when D. & H. goes up a little V
higher we will unload gradually on the market" 4
the 10,000 shares. Washburn will buy them in ..
to prevent me from doing so. Then when Blum‘, ’ "
presents his option I will hand him the 20,000
shares. That will paralyze the clique. It will
then be up to them to save themselves by‘ un-
loading the blocks of stock they have acquired to
swing the deal. Tliey’ll never be able ‘to _do_it
without a-fall in the price of D. & H., and in the 
panic that is almost certain to ensue they will be ‘ :—
snowed under." - r ’

Mr. Golding rubbed his hands with joy at the
prospect which confronted the unsuspecting con-“
spirators. Everything came out just as the bro- _
ker had predicted it. would. He sold Jack's '
10,000 shares in blocks of 2,000 at prices varying ,
from 110 to 115, and the clique had to take it in '
to carry out their purpose. , -- .

Jack’s proﬁts on the entire deal were $343,000,’.
which, when he added his capital of $132,000,.
gave him a ﬁnancial standing of $475,000—not bad.
for a boy on the eve of his eighteenth birthday,
and two years’ experience in the Street. As for
Washburn, Blum, and the rest of the clique, they
found themselves in the soup for fair after Blum‘
presented his option, and W313 thoroughly con-”—"

way. But that was impossible, for the nioment

the shares began to drop. Their defeat soon be-= ’
came a complete rout, and both Washburn and
Blum were so badly crippled that they had‘ to
leave the Street. The story was bound to leak out,’
and Jack Holland becamethe mostifainous boy

neath a. rush of coal and debris at the Locust
Spring mine of the Philadelphia & Reading Com-
pany on September 29, 1921, came to’ an end with
the ﬁnding of the man’s skeleton in an under-
ground passage of the mine. -

Identiﬁcation was made by his clothes and ar-

mated by officials of the company to have cost

Organized gangs of card sharps operating on
railroad trains are responsible for the posting by
the Pullman Company of the following bulletin in

age mortal.”

The warning is emphasized by a picture show-.
ing the ,corner of the ace of clubs sticking out
of a man’s pocket. ‘ .

ROB AND THE REPORTERS

.._ Or, ._
Hustling for War News by Wireless '

By GASTON GARNE,

(A Serial Story.)

CHAPTER II.-(Continued).

‘He closed the door when Rob followed him into
the room, and said:~

“Now look here, boy, I didn’t bring you down
here for the fun of the thing. I thought I saw
a chance to get a man“ of my own choosing a
steady job at the wireless station, and I think
so still. If I was to put you in there, I want you
to stand by me and see that my news agency ge't$
first crack at all the war news. Mind, I say all.

,Will you promise me this?”

“Now the cat is out of the bag,” thought Rob,
and he hesitated before replying.

“Speak up! What's the matter with you?”
blurted Garvey. “Isn’t it enough that I took you
off the street and made you a present of twenty-
ﬁve dollars? Say?”

“I shall lame to abide by the rules,” replied
Rob.

, “Rules be hanged! While you are on night
duty I shall be on hand every night for the pres-

- ent; the same by day when you take the day shift.
'The other man I’ve got . ﬁxed; the one who has

been working the night shift we couldn't touch.
That’s why you’re here——see? But I guess you
don’t quite understand yet. The twenty-ﬁve per
comes out of my pocket. You get your salary
besides.” - A

It was a temptation for Rob; there was no
denying it. -

He knew his business. Here was just the sort
of job, he wanted offering double pay.

“Is young French to be discharged?” he asked.

“Have you been snooping around the station
when I told you not to?” asked Garvey, duickly.

“No, I haven’t.. Just the same, I happened to

I . meet French.”

“I hope, then, you didn’t do any talking?"

,“No, I‘didr.’t.”

“Well, .what’s your decision? French will be
discharged toknight, all right, and for blame good
reasons. The job'is yours for the asking. If you
don't want it I’ll thank you to hand me back

DISH on THE PROPHET

One of the oldest dishes of which any record
can be found is the Arabian “khabis,” which is
said to have been invented and named by the
prophet Mohammed. It consists of _ﬁne selected
dates coated with a mixture of honey and butter,
and it is still a favorite dessert and confection
among ‘the Orientals to whom the date is a staple
food. It is interesting to note that the word
“khabis” has come to be used by the Arabs as
a’ synonym for happiness.

The first prophet of Islam must have been a
very skillful dietitian, for his favorite dish would
be an almost perfect and very digestible food.
Dates contain a form of sugar which is especial-

.ly easy for the human body to assimilate and

also protein, fat, lime, iron- and cellulose or
roughage. With the butter to increase the pro-
tein content of the mixture and the honey sup-
plying more sugar in a digestible from the
prophet’s delight would make an excellent meal
all by itself. -

‘FOREST RECLAIMS TOWN
Rudyard Kipling’s tale of the devastated In-
dian village which “went back to the jungle” has
aiprototype in Norwich Township, McKean Coun-

 ty, Pa.‘, since the site of the once ﬂourishing lum-

ber town of Norwich has become State Game
Refuge No. 30. _
Twenty years ago the site of the town -was
liewn out of the forest by the" Norwich Lumber
Company, with headquarters at)Buifalo, N. Y.
A largesawmill was erected and other industries
‘were established, and for ﬁfteen years Norwich

' “was a thriving town of 1,500 people, with schools,

churches, theatres and stores.

Then the timber in the adjacent forests be-
came exhausted, the lumber company disman-
tied the, mill and moved it away, and the town
began to-fade from the map. About three years

, gfa the -wholesite of the town was sold as part

at large tract taken over by the State as a

_ game preserve. «The remaining buildings in the

village were torn down and_ moved“ away, until
jonlyone structure was left, a church. This also

 vwaslsold and torn down about -a year ago.

N. R.. Buller, Commissioner of State Fisheries,
announced that Indian Run, Havens Brook and

- Long Hollow Run, brooks which ﬂow through the ‘
’ refuge, were to be closed to ﬁshermen for ﬁve
ﬂy years and would be used as nurseries forthe prop-
’: agationyof brook trout. These were famous trout

PUBLISHERS WANT “RADIO RIGHTS

As most books of the present day are protected
by “serial” “movie” and “dramatic” rights, so the
books of the future are likely to be covered by
“radio” rights. Authors and publishers want to
receive royalties from the works that are broad-
cast to the unseen listeners. Certain publishers
of books and novels are taking steps whereby the
copyrights of their publications will be protected
as far:.as radio broadcasting is concerned. .

’ WEDDED BY WIRELESS ,

The crew of a British trawler from the Arctic
regions_report being present at a wireless wed-
ding at Matochkin Shar, Nova Zembla, where the
Soviet Government has a large station‘.

The British crew amused themselves listening
in nightly, and one night heard Matochkin calling
for the marriage commissar at Archangel. When
the commissar reported himself the station at Ma-
tochkin answered th-atone of its female employes
wanted to register her marriage.

«The commissar wirelessed the usual questions
and then pronounced the marriage complete.

TUNER FOR GRIMES CIRCUIT

It is not at all necessary to use a variocoupler
for the tuning elements in the Grimes Inverse
Duplex receiver. Any other form of tuner which
is designed to permit a variation in the coupling
between the tuning coils can be satisfactorily em-
played for this purpose. Such means of tuning
may consist of two spider web coils so arranged
that their inductive coupling can _be varied. Of
course, the usual variable condenser of 43 plates
will have to be used in the primary circuit in
order to permit it to be ’cuned.\ :

A FALSE STANDARD
It is a misnomer to rate the capacitv of a
variable condenser according to the number of
plates. And yet there are many who list variable

condensers as 11, 23, 43, or any number of plates.

That this method of rating the size of a con-
denser is inaccurate may be gathered from the
following illustration: Suppose two novices are
each making a set which calls for a 43-plate
variable condenser. One man ‘goes to a dealer
and buys a vertain 43—plate condenser which has
The other man

buys a 43-plate condenser in another store which
measures .0Q077 microfarads.
capacity is sufficient to cause a variation in tun-

ing of perhaps 100 meters. ‘ .

All diagrams shoulsl indicate condenser capacity
in microfarads (mfds.), and it would be a step
ahead in matters of standardization in the radio
field if manufacturers and dealers would label

_‘ their condensers with true ratings of their ca-
ﬂpacities in microfarads.

went to the palace to explain the operation of
the instruments. An opera was scheduled to be
broadcast from the Municipal Theatre in Rio de
Janeiro through the microphone of Station SPC
in that city. It was long past the hour for the
music to enter the ether, but not a sound could

' be heard, although the; set appeared to be work-

ing all right. 4'
The operator called the station -and was in-

formed that the opera had not begun. Then he

called the theatre and located the trouble. ,.

“YOU? EXC811eI1CY/’ he. reported to the Presi-
dent, “the entire audience is awaiting your ar-
rival. The opera cannot start until you are
seated.” The President rushed off to the theatre
and soon other members of the family who had
stayed at home heard the ovation greeting the ‘
President upon his arrival.

THE BIG FACTOR IN RANGE
One of the first questions asked by the novice
when he is looking over outﬁts for the purpose '
of making a purchase, is, “How great a distance
can this radio m_usic.be heard?” This question
is one that cannot be very well answered. ,
Radio can be compared to the effect one obtains ‘
while standing‘at the shore of a pond that is still
and tossing a stone into the water. A circle of
waves will start about the place where the stone
dropped. If the pond is large enough there will ‘
However,
onecould not pick out a- single spot and say,’ “on .
this side the waves are visible and on the other ~ ‘
side they are invisible. Therefore, there are " «
none on this side.” , '
.This is much the same as in the situation of a
receiving set, but with this important difference-:‘ .
The distance that a receiving set will receive“.
audibly will depend on the receiviiig set. A con-'
cert may be quite audible on one set and on an.
other may not be heard _,at all.— _ *'
A part of this difference may be due to .dif.
ferent hookups, the degree of ampliﬁcation em;
ployed and tl'te.sensitivity of the phones. A grea.
deal of differencemay be found in the batteries
employed in applying current to the set." Owing
to the importance of- the batteries there is one
type especially made for the purpose and an‘ auto;
mobile battery cannot be used with the best of
results. - c 
' The best way to test out an amplifying trans.
former is by substitution. The average fan does
not have the facilities to test out a transformer}
We would suggest begging or borrowing one,» in
order to substitute it for the one you believe is“,

this nature in this section, but some one some
day will bring one. Then, perhaps, some opera-

’ tors of “nuisance receivers” will realize what they

are doing. . t

The campaign against reradiating receivers
seems to be gaining headway. All through the
country the radio departments of“ newspapers are
printing warnings to owners of single circuit sets
of the harm careless operation of these sets are
doing to radio. Owners of receiving sets are
learning the causes of the squeals and are
spreading the information among their friends.
The reradiation squeal is so very much of a nui-
sance that it is reasonable to believe that the
evil will in the course of a few months he elimi-
nated by the broadcast listeners themselves. If
it is not the only thing that can be done is to
have laws barring the use of receivers capable
of annoying reradiation.

Most of the harm done is by the general use
of the’ zero beat method of tuning.- There may
be some excuse.for the zero beat method of tuning
if WDAP or KFI is through, although it
really is not much more efficient than the “follow
up method.” When the zero method is used in
Brooklyn to catch W J Z, W E A F or W O R, the
whole proceeding is silly and indicates that the
operator using it has a depression where his
bump of intelligence ought to be. If a Brooklyn-

’ I Aite can’t get a local station without squealing in

and out of it half a dozen times his neighbors-

) can only conclude that his set is hopelessly in-

eﬁicient, that his knowledge of tuning is very
small or that he. simply doesn’t care.
The shame ‘of it is that the single circuit re-

 ceiver is a good receiver when intelligently con-

structed and used. The trouble is that so few
persons intelligently use it.

Broadcast listeners who know the harm that
reradiation is doing can assist in the war on the

a . nuisance by letting their friend_s_know what
causes the squealing. A friendly visit to a‘neigh- '

bor and a demonstration of the tuning in of the
stations without letting the set squeal will help.

, ' ' TUBES OF MANY TYPES

All vacuum tubes, are not ideiitical nor are
they interchangeable. They may_1ook alike to
most people, especially if they are of the same
size and“kind, but there may be slight differences
iii the internal dimensions and degree of vacuum
or gas contents which are not apparent upon close

 examination. ,

. First there is’ the dry cell tube classed as the
WD11 and 12, followed by the three volt tube
called -..the UV199 or C299. Among the tubes
-referred to as six volt tubes are the PV20O or

‘ C300 and the UV201A or C301A. Many radio

ianybelieve that the dry cell tubes are as good
as the storage battery tubes. Is there any theory
in this? ‘
For an experiment take the UV199 tube. _ Every
one-‘knows who ‘has used this tube that its ele-
rnentsﬂare smaller than those in the larger tubes,
therefore-it cannot be expected that the output
tom such tubes can -be equal. -_ Its ﬁlament, sup-
« yﬂrted between two upgrights, is short compared

is lacking in its ﬁlament is made up in efficiency"

by the materials employed in its construction.
For its ﬁlament the UV199 tube employs

toriated tungsten, which gives off a. maximum ;

quantity of electrons, with a minimum amount of
energy applied to its ﬁlament.

This tube is a good radio frequency tube. If
one looks at the bottom of this tube it will be
seen that the studs are short compared to other
tubes on the market. This is an important factor,
especially for radio frequency ampliﬁcation, since
it eliminates a great amount of capacity. Then,
too, the grid and plate studs are not adjacent,
as in other tubes, but are opposite each other.
This feature tends to reduce capacity effect be-
tween them. '

The UV199 tube is satisfactory for audio fre-
quency ampliﬁcation but it will not give an out-
put comparable with UV201A or other six volt
tubes. If, however, sufficient precautions are
taken enough volume can be had from the UV199
or C299 to operate a loud talker.

Another type of tube is the WD11 or the WD12.

The WD12 tube, with prongs not quite as short ‘

as the UV199, constitutes a good radio frequency
ampliﬁer but when used as an audio frequency
ampliﬁer it is well to add a C battery in the
second stage. = I
When using dry cell tubes in combination with
other tubes care must be taken to get theproper
ﬁlament voltage on the tube. It is not advisable
to employ a dry cell tube as a R. F. tube, a

UV199 as a detector and two‘ six volt tubes as '
ampliﬁers all drawing voltage from the one bat- .

tery. Unless the beginner beconversent with the

requirements of all‘ the tubes it is best to use

the same type throughout the set. ‘

tremely sensitive. ‘The variation of the filament
current is accomplished by means of a variable

resistance or rheostat‘ placed in series with the '

ﬁlament lighting battery.

The majority of vacuum tube detectors operate‘

best on B batteries between sixteen and twenty-
two volts. ~

Ampliﬁer tubesilook like detector tubes and can-'

not easily be distinguished except by examining
their electrical characteristics. Ampliﬁers are
not critical in adjustment whéncompared with
the detector tubes. They will operate success-
fullyyon voltages of 45 to 100. When a detector

tube together with two stages of ampliﬁcation.

are used three or four twenty-two volt Bbatteries
may be connected together‘ in series. Where ex-
tremely loud signals are desired the plate voltage
may be‘raised to 100 volts without damaging the‘
tubes. However, the use of; such ‘high voltage
increases tube noises and is therefore not to be
recommended. ‘

The differ nce between audio and radio fre-

quency amp iﬁcation is that when an incoming.

signal which is. at high frequency is rectified by
the detector it is changed into ‘low frequency, and
this is ampliﬁed by the following ampliﬁers. By

means of radio frequency ampliﬁcations the in‘-,
'coming signals are ampliﬁed before they reach, .

KNEW CIGAR BOX WOOD

‘Spanish cedar may be supplanted as raw ma-
terial for cigar‘ boxes’ by a Philippine wood known
as kalantas, if residents of the islaﬂs who are
interested in the development of the lumber busi-
ness therehave their way. According to a re-
port of the Philippine Forestry Service that has
been received by the Department of Commerce,
kalaiitas is practically identical with Spanish ce-
dar from tropical America, andhas the further
advantage of being grown in a possession of the
United. States. Spanish cedar has heretofore
been considered the ﬁnest wood obtained in the
world for cigar boxes, but kalantas is said to be
so nearly like it in color, texture and odor that

_ only an expert woodsman can tell them apart.

PLANS TO RIDE FALLS IN’ A BIG RUBBER
BALL

Bobby Leach, who went over the Horseshoe
Falls in a steel barrel on July 25, 1911, announced
that he is negotiating with a rubber company for

.- iv! r-'*"‘.t“"5?(_“-‘Vnr‘! -y- :«- <

plans to make a trip over the Falls early next
June. Prior to the Falls trip Leach says he will
make three parachute..leaps from the upper steel
arch bridge on successive Sundays.
, The ball will be of the thickness of an ordinary
 large automobile tire and will have a hammock
‘ inside ‘in which he will recline, Leach said. He
plans to have the ball with himself as passenger
- placed in the water a few hundred feet above
" the Falls on the Canadian side. He believes that
 7 the ball will clear the great plunge of water and
’ will land safely in the river below.

Leach has attracted attention by daring feats
about the Falls for several years. In addition
to going over the Falls in a barrel, he made a_ par-
achute leap from the upper bridge on April 21,
1921, and went through the lower rapids and
whirlpool in a barrel on June 28, 1911. .

STEEL FURNITURE
Furniture of steel is admirably adapted for use
in the home and possesses certain advantages
which the ordinary furniture made of wood does
not offer. When steel furniture is prepared for
. the home or office it is ﬁnished with an attractive
surface in stove enamel, the-color and ﬁnish be-
ing adapted to the room and purpose for which
the article is intended. , . _ _
. Adjustable steel shelving _ is ‘particularly
' adapted for kitchen use and ﬁnished With a hard
.white enamel surface and looks extremely clean
‘.  and inviting. - These shelves can be used for or-
‘ ~' dinary pots and pans, and for the storage of veg-
etables, etc. For kitchen and pantry steel is
_ much= more hygienic than wood.
’ The steel cupboard is also invaluable in the
'-store, for it provides dry and yet well ventilated
' shelving in w ich to store rice, ﬂour, sugar, etc.
“' ‘Ventilating l‘ res in the doors provide for fresh
; air, and these apertures can.-be covered with a
 ﬁne mesh wire to secure complete immunity from
spiders, ﬂies or vermin of any kind. __
The housewife in warm climates will rejoice
in such a cupboard for her storeroom, ventilated
yet perfectly protected from the ravages of ants,
.cockroaches and all other -pests of the lands of
.perpetual'sunshine.' . ’ ‘

'*7R0'MAN FORT RUINS FOUND IN CARDIFF

The ruins of a Roman fort, seven acres in ex-
ent, on of the largest in Wales, will be uncov-
,ere‘d soo . The fort is known as “Y Gaer” and is
"two, and one-half miles west of Brecon. The ex-
".éa=v:ation, it is expected, will throw. much light on
‘ thelrelationship of the native and Roman inhab-
,  f Wales during a period of two or more
' centuries. The history of a large. fort, such as
‘K o_:-eaer; when fully known, should be a mi-
 of much. of the history of Wales. ’

The Gaer Excavation Committee, of which Lord,
Kenyon is chairman, met in Cardiff recently and
took immediate steps to raise the $10,000 needed
for the excavation. The defenses of the fort In-‘
clude a bank and a wall nine feet high. The gate-
ways, where exposed, are of massive masonry
which recalls that of the great forts of I_ladi~ian"s
Wall. Within the defenses the remains of stone
buildings are known to exist beneath the turf and
outside of these will be found, it is expected, the
ruins of the civil settlement which usually sprang
up beneath the walls of a fortress of this type.

A few yards away from the fort stands the
carved Roman tombstone of a man and his wife,
long a local landmark, known as the “Main y
Morwynion” or “Maiden’s Stone.” In the neigh-
borhood has been found another stone whose in-
scription proves that the fort, at one time, was
garrisoned by a cavalry regiment originally re-
cruited in Spain. “ i

It is hoped to begin the excavation in July un-
der the direction of Dr. R. E. M. Wheeler of the
National Museum of Wales. -

FOUND GOLD IN CELLAR

Between $500 and $700 in gold and silver coins
was unearthed by workmen at a vacant house at
No. 318 Pine street, Baltimore, recently. Word
of the “gold mine” spread like wildfire through
the colored section nearby and soon scores of men
and women had- abandoned everything else to dig
in the pile of dirt in front of the house.

By the time the police arrived and drove them
away scores of searchers had reached dazzling
heights of wealth by the acquisition of three or
four $10 gold pieces. Discovery by the El Do-
rado in the vacant house was made by workmen
who were remodeling it. They were digging in
the cellar and throwing the dirt on the sidewalk
in front when one of the men noticed something
shining in the dirt. Idly he bent over and picked
it up. It was a. $10 gold piece.

GREEN ORANGES CAN BE COLORED
‘An orange may be inwardly ripe when out-
wardly green and if allowed to yellow on the
trees the marketing may be delayed four to six
weeks and consequently a less favorable price
may be obtained, writes The Scientiﬁc Amervlcan.
This green condition gives the Satsufa orange
grower more concern than others. Satsumas are
raised in upper Florida, lower Alabama and low-
er Mississippi. Normally they are gathered
about October 15, but they can be harvested earl-
ier when artiﬁcial processes of coloring are used

~'to get away from the persistent greenness of

skin.. ' _

The United States Department of Agriculture
has worked out a process for coloring oranges
without harming the fruit. The process consists
of enclosing the oranges in tight rooms and sub-
jecting them to fumes of kerosene stoves or to
gasoline engine exhaust. The fumes given off
destroy the green chlorophyll so that the yellow
of the orange shows up. It requires about four
days tobring out the yellow of the oranges by
this process. This is better than waiting four
to six weeks for the fruit to ripen on the trees,
running the risk of frost or storm damage and
facing the probabilitv of a lower market when the
oranges are ultimately harvested.

morning plunge on a certain day, the men being

dressed in frock coats and high silk hats, and the .

women in their demurest day dresses. This

The police checked this move also, prohibiting
the demonstration. The organizers of the pro-’

test then sought a court injunction against th_e~

police to enable them to bathe in their silk hats
and everything if they wanted to. The court
ruled, however, that the police were within their

ICE IN JUNE
AND JULY

Lateness of
spring‘ this year
and the statement
that the sun is"
sending the earth
less heat have led
to many compari-
sons with 1816,
“the year without
a summer.”

Records of the
Government de-
partment contain
a full report on
the summer of
1816, repetition
of which is feared
in some quarters.
The mean tem-
perature in Phil-
ndelphia, accord-
ing to records, for
April’ of that
year was 47.
With a mild be-
g 1 n n i n g, the
month terminated
with cold and
blustering weath-
er.

‘May had a tem-
perature of 64,
which promised a
fairiseason. June
was cold, with an
average tempera-‘
ture _of' 64. There’
 ice and vege-
tables were in-
gured. Six to ten
inches of snow
fell in Vermont,
three inches
New York and
several inches in
New Hampshire
and Maine. ‘

‘ The average

teinperature  for ‘

July was only 68.‘-

SPICES IN
HISTORY

 

The tantalizing

ﬂavor and p1-
quant qualities
of spices have

them sought after
from the earliest
days of mankind,
and an adjunct
to civilization at
all periods.

In the early
days of history
spices were worth
fabulous sums,
owing to the dif-
ficulty of obtain-
ing them and the

' hi g h c o s t o f
transportation.

When Alaric
the Goth con-
quered Rome in
410 A. D., he
asked as a ran-

som 3,000 pounds »

of‘ pepper, then
worth more than
its weight in gold.
The first organ-
ization! of deal-
ers, it is said,
was the “frater-
nity of pepper-
ers,” and it was
in the fourteenth
century that the
7 name“ was chang-
ed to the “guild
of" grocers,”
which depicted on
its coat of arms
six cloves.
W Venice at its
height‘ traded in
‘spices to the
amount of $10,-
000,000 annually,
V and it vied with
Portugal in se-
curin g cargoes
from far East-

 ern ports. Co-
I u m b us w a 5
V ‘bound for the

spices of the East
when he chanced
upon a new con-
tinent, and Vasco
de G a m a, the

riéer,’ ‘made’ one .of
