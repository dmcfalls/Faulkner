, “Of course not,” answered the lawyer, dryly.
“Still, no one could accuse my late respected
client as being otherwise than I a sensible and
level-headed old gentleman.”

The remark. was evidently distasteful to the
young man, for he said, a bit impatiently:

“Will you kindly read over once more the

“There is-—a most charming condition I should

“You refer to the young lady—-Bessie Bron-

“Of course. It is hardly necessary for me to

. go over the paragraph ‘again. Relieved» of’? its
legal points it amounts to this——that Mr. Golding

= '-">"("}ood lawsi” exclaimed Sid, hardly able to be- .

 
  

give good feed aboard this boat,'so you’ll live like
a king till we reach Cape Town, and it won’t cost
you a nickel.” 

Sid mechanically did as he was told and made
a hearty meal.

Then he accompanied his companion on deck.
feeling muchbetter, but" still puzzled about Mr.
Dicer’s assertion that he had actually been drunk
the night before, and had been brought» aboard —
the steamer . in that condition.

He couldn‘t believe ‘it. for he had a rooted ob-
jection to ‘spirituous liquor. .
The sporty man engaged him in conversation
to keep his thoughts occupied, and from dwelling

on the incidents of the previous evening,

It was not till after dinner that he got a

chance to coolly sum up the situation by himself,’ ‘

and when he did he came to the conclusionpthat
he had not been drunk at all, but hocussed by his
new acquaintance, who, for some unknownreason,
A had played. this game upon him. -
Having reached the most satisfactory explan-V
ation» of the singular affair that was possible’ Sid’s

first intention was to have it out with Mr. Dicer. ,  

' On second thoughts he decided that it would
only be ,a waste of—arg'ument. ‘

He entertained no great regret at leaving New
York ifthere was anything in the change for him,
for he had no ties to hold him to thecity, and
was rather sick of his job in Jacob Street. ‘ .

The only thing he felt disposed to kick about
was the sudden and peculiar way in which he had 5
been carried off. , ‘ . .,

Just why Mr. Dicer was so anxious to have him
for a business companion he could not guess, but
on the whole his curiosity as to the outcome of",
itghe matter somewhat reconciled him to the situa-

ion. '

The sporty man seemed to be a sociable’, ‘easy-’
going associate, and though the boy felta bit sus-

picious of him, after what had happened, still hq,  e 7

could not say thatghe disliked the man. . .

Sid, being something of a philosopher, decided
to make the best of things as he found them, for
he certainly could not change them. -

Mr. Dicer was pleased to death when he found I l I

the boy more tractable than he expected, and '

’shook hands with himself over the prospect of:

He gave Sid a i game of talk about the cir-

cus company, he al eged he was connected with, , __,_—'

and about the business he was going to Africa to

transact, with such assistance as the boy might

be called on to render. ' S , '
He was such a smooth, convincing talker that

Sid really believed he was telling the truth, and‘ "

began to feel’ some interest in the part he would . ;
play in the business. '

Thus at the end of a couple of days the boy
ceased to consider the way he had been brought.

As"they followed Mr. Dicer and Dick’s tutor,

 they noticed that the streets, at right an-

' .most part- of an Eastern type, with heavy

town, for the streets appear to be quite regularly
laid out; All you need to know is the name or
number of the place‘ you want to reach, and a
few inquiries will land you there all right.
Where's Mr. Dicer?”

“Playing pool in the barroom. Are you ready
to take a stroll; if ou are, I'll go in and tell
him I'm going off a w ile, with you, ’ said Sid.

“I'm ready whenever you are,” responded Dick.

Mr. Dicer had no objection to Sid going around
with his new friend, and so the boys went off to-
gether, and spent the whole of the afternoon ex-
ploring the town. i "

Whatever business the sporty man had on
hand during the week that followed he had no
occasion to call on =»Sid’s services, much to that
lad‘s surprise.

“So far this job of mine seems to be a sin-
ecure,” he told Dick. “I haven’t done a single —
thing yet to earn my wages and expenses. Prob-
ably Ill make up for it later,‘ for surely Mr.
Dicer didn’t pa my way to South Africa merely

“I’m ready to go. I’ll leave word with the clerk
of the house to tell Mr.;Dicer, if he asks for me,
where we have gone.”

Half an hour later they were seated in a small
but well—built sailboat, spinning down the sunlit
bay under the inﬂuence of .8. smacking land
breeze. , .».~ ‘- I
_ They reached the warship in due time, but
were ordered by a sentry to keep‘ oif. \

As ,Dick,started to climb up he pulled himself, a ”

It was an easy matter for them to reach the
ground, and then they walked cautiously to the
corner of the storehouse and peeped around 1t.~
There was nothing in sight to alarm them, so they
went on to the next corner,_which commanded a
view of the front, and also of the river. Here, if
any place, they expected to find the watcher, but l~
there was none. , _ i ‘

“Things seem‘ to be coming our way,”. said Siﬂ. ,»
,“If we do get away what a mad skipper Captain
Sombrero will be in the morning.”

To reach the river side where the schooner lay, - r
with the sailboat still attached to her stern, they ‘
had to pass down the main and only street of the,’ 
village. ' If there, were any wakeful ones in that ’
direction they could not help being seen. After ‘

a moment’s hesitation they sallied forth from the
shadow of the storehouse, stepping as lightly as
possible over the hard, well—trodden ground. They"
prudently refrained from talking lest the sound .
of their voices shouldlbetray them. It was a ‘
ticklish walk, for so much_ depended on reaching ’ '
the river wishout discovery. It was accomplished,
however, successfully, and then the boys breathed
freer. '_They could not reach the sailboat without 1- -
boarding the schooner ﬁrst, and as the crew
were doubtless aboard,_s1eeping in the fogecastle 
forward, they had to be particularly, careful. Sid”. 7
stepped aboard first, and ‘Dick glided after him. '
They made their way aft, ' ’ , .

‘‘Pull in the boat,” whispered Sid, “while, I '

untie the line.” V 3
' Dick obeyed, but found it a hard job, for the’ -
tide was setting strong up the river, which was- 
the contrary direction to the course,they’d have

to follow to reach the coast. Just as the bow of  
the Hboatwas brought up to the schooner’s quar-I ‘
ter, and Sid had cast oli‘ the line, a black face
and a pair of burly shoulders suddenly appeared -
up the short companionway from the cabin. He ’
uttered a shout and then jabbering like a big’, —.

i monkey he sprang at the boys.

" ‘.‘Excuse me, miss,” said Sid to the'i;'air girl,
‘“you appear to be a prisoner in the hands of
{these rascals.” _ . v. ' ' I
“I am,” she replied in a quivering voice, her
eyes ﬁlling with tears. “I .was carriedolf last
inight from a. large ostrich ranch where’ the lady
whose traveling companion I am is visiting. Her
* brother owns the ranch, and she expects to stop

It was certainly a strange freak of fate. ,

“Mar name is Sidney Sherwood, and this is my ‘
frien , Dick Duncan,” said Sid. “Both of us be: ‘
long to New York City. Dick came to South‘ _‘
Africa for his health, and I on business in the
employ of a circus representative seeking animals
for his show.” , V

Then, in as few words as possible, he told her.
how Dick and himself came tabs in their present , ', .
unenviable position. ’ , ' '

After Sid -had concluded‘ his story, the girl‘
told hers. - ‘ '

She explained how she had been traveling in
England and various European countries with" ‘,‘
’Miss Black, a middle—aged maiden lady, whose V >
home was in one of the brownstone fronts bri
Fifth Avenue, New York, and that they were '
windin up their tour at the ostrich ranch of the ’*
lady’s rother, ‘oeing booked to sail from Cape '
Town in two months. 4,, , 

Miss Bronson then said that she was fond 
of horseback riding, and to enable her to enjby,
that healthful recreation, Mr. Black had placbd '"
‘oéie of his horses at her disposal during her ‘
s ay. , g .
She went on one of "these long rides the p/re-' . 
vious day, and, venturing into the lower rt of 
the range, to view a waterfall she had earned ,
was there, she had suddenly comeupon the party; v
of natives in whose power she now was. ' c L 2
The resu.lt‘of the encounter was her seizure by» 
them. I c ‘ ' 

They turned her, horse loose and immediately _ _
started north with her, in spite of her‘ tearful 
protests. " ' , r ‘ '

The presenceof the two boys, who were her ,_
own countrymen, greatly comforted Miss Bro‘n- 
son, and the future did not look quite aspdarkzas ,  3
it had shortly before.» v . “Z

T Finally the leader of the band gave some order 
in a guttural tone and the boat was headed in for if *
the nearest bank. V I

They were screened’ from the hot rays 6f the
sun by thethick leaves of the largest tree. .,

A bag was taken from the bows of the boat 
and its contents tumbled out onuthe round.

This proved to be a kind of drie meat, a lot?

fruit. ,2 I . =’-' 2

The‘ food was divided among all hands, includ— 5

After disposing of it they lay down and weijit, w
to sleep, with the exception of one of their mm»;
her deputed to keep watch on the prisoners. ’ ‘

_ The party remained at their resting place un
til sunset, when the leader gave orders to re
\ embark.‘ . l

The prisoners were aroused and marched;
aboard the boat. '  ' ’

CHAPTER X.—-The ..Kraal of King Dahomey.

 

i  another day had dawned upon their unhappy con-
‘ a ition. '

Dick was bent forward, with his elbows on his
knees, and his hands supporting his face, asleep.
, Bessie Bronson’s head, with its mass of un-
‘ combed brown tresses, still rested .on Sid’s shoul-_.
der, and her gentle, regular breathing told him
that she, too, was unconscious, for the time, of
her desperate position. , «
 At that moment the boat swept around a turn

in the stream, and a large native village burst
on Sid’s view.
, -There were at least a hundred huts of various
 sizes, all one story, of course, with thatched
roofs, and walls constructed of a species of bam-

 

 
    
  
 
  

oo. .
; Tlfey formed aplarge semi-circle around a big
open spot, like the square of a city.

, stood a long stone building of one story, with a
ﬂat roof.

 . About a quarter of a mile in the rear of this

building was another structure which overlooked

This was the temple, or idol house.

As soon as the boat was perceived from the
shore, quite a crowd of blacks came lazily to-
ward-the landing to welcome the bunch that had
been away. i r
; “Wake up, old chap,” said Sid, shaking Dick.
[“We are at the end of our journey, I guess.” ,

Bessie also opened her eyes, released herself
with a blush from Sid’s partial,.embrace, and
then the three" young people viewed the novel
.scene".before them with quite some interest, not-
‘withstanding theseriousness of their own situa-
tion.

The leader of the expedition, standing up be-
hind the prisoners, ordered them to step ashore,
_ "=Dick led the way, and Sid, with Bessie cling-

ing to his arm, followed. .
~, At a guttural ‘command the rowers closed
' around them, the leader went to the front, and
then the.line of march was begunwhich took the
"party toward the square. ‘ —

' The villagers foll'owed, making the air,resound
,yvi»th’their exclamations. ' q
 'At»the edge‘ of the square the crowd around
them and at their heels stopped and they, at-
tended. only by their captors, advanced toward
the long stone ediﬁce.

 Their approach hadevidently been noted from
the building, for the curtain parted and —a tall
black man, of powerful physique, very lightly
Iclad, appeared.

To him theleader addressed himself, and they
eld quite a pow-wow. _ ‘
v,;"The black chap stepped forward and uttered
some command.

/ilmmvediately the guard that stood around the
three young prisoners fell back and. left Sid, Dick

A moment later a gorgeous-looking black man .
walked pompouslyforth, followed by srblack fee" 5
male, bedecked in gold and silver jeweled orna-
ments. v ~ ~ . p i V - y ,

The new comerswere King Dahomey and his  ‘
queen consort. , ‘

Neither had any more clothing than the climate
would stand-for. _ , p

What they had, however, was of the
and most striki_ng material. j _ . p . .
The k1ng’s legs were bare from the knees 
down, but'only the queen’s ankles showed below '
her light tunic. v ‘ ' 1;"
Around the ankles of both were heav golden
bands, while their feet were protected mm the
ground by sandals, the cross-bands of which were
thick with precious stones. ‘ .i

The arms of botl1‘_were bare to their shoulders;
and were decorated at the wrists and above the‘ ‘v
elbow with lighter bands of pure gold. '

' The king wore a naval oﬂ‘icer’s cocked‘ hat, to‘
which many jewels 'and,featl1ers were attached}.
while the queen had on a golden tiara, that N,
sparkled in the ‘sunlight with diamonds, rubies, '~
sapphires and other precious stones.

The big black man, came forward, and, ‘seizing
Bessie by the arm, led the shrinking girl «for-'
ward a step or two and left her standing ‘before
the ebony queen. ' .- 

Her majestcy scanned the young American girl
critically, an ﬁnally ‘uttered a grunt of satis-
faction. - , T ‘ é 

She said something to .the king, who in turn’
said something to the big black‘ man, whereupon‘
that personage walked up to Bessie, grabbed her"
once more by the arm and, pointing at the cur- «

'tained entrance, intimated that she was to enter,
the building. ‘ r ’ ' j ;

Bsesisie turned around and looked appealingly
at i ; "~ V '

That lad stepped forward in a resolute way .
and caught the girl’s other arm. ~ ,. .

’The king looked-angry at this actionon the
boy’s part, and gave. some order in his own‘

language. . . ,-
The leader of the bunch that had captured-the
isirisoners came forward and laid his hand ~ on‘
id’s shoulder. " ' ’ .' 
As Bessie was led away King Dahomey looked
the two boys over.’ i ’ , ' 1
Then he gave an order. to the leader of the”
boat’s crew. f i, .

CHAPTER AXIII.—Rescued By a Girl.’

At first/Sid and Dick tried to keep track of the l L

lapse of time, but gradually "they grew careless

and lost track of the matter. -
-“I guess we've been here a year,” remarke

Dick, one morning, “and still we’re alive and be:

_ ring supplied with food as regularly as clockwork i !
almost.” ' '

“It seems a great waste of energy on the part V 
of-_ King Dahomey to keep us here so long,’-’ re- .
plied Sid. “Stillwe may ﬁ‘gure»that the-»wily"

lot to know how Bessie is getting on.” ' .
“Maybe she’s married to. the king long before
this. . Some of these African potentates have a
whole\. string of wives.” '
“Say, don’t make such suggestions. You'll make"!

“Excuse me, old chap, I didn't mean to hurt  '-

The’ day passed away as others had before it. -
Night came around and they turned in on their - 32
beds and were soon asleep. Some hours later Sid‘ W 
was .awakened by a touch on his shoulder. He 
started up and confronted—.Bessie Bronson. - ‘ . 3

‘.‘Bessie!” he cried, springing to his feet, hard-I xx
ly believing his eyes. “Is it really you "’ i .. ‘ 

Before she could answer he grabbed her in his ‘ 1
arms and covered her blushing «face with kisses,_"'
Then he recollected himself and began to. apolo-, ’

CHAPTER I.
Unexpected Passengers.

'' '.Two young men were riding downtown in a

, , Broadway [car in the city of New York one Octo-

' ber mornin a few years ago when two persons
entered an took seats opposite.

, , One was a very pretty girl of? about twenty,

‘ wearing a derby hat and a long, double-breasted

stornbcoat, her curly hair out rather short for

‘ a. young woman. a '

’ ' Her companion was

‘a man iwho might have

 3 been anywhere fromzfortyto seventy years of

m ‘age, as far as one could tell by his looks-

 V: He was tall, thin, smooth-shaven, very bald,
" ‘quite near—sighted and with an absent~minded
, look which ‘showed that his._thoughts were any-

,’ Vwhere but upon his surroundings.

f - «His clothes were of somber black, his hat was

:.‘.'a broad-brimmed felt; he wore boots not too

carefully polished, and his turned-down collar

i " was encircled with a black silk scarf.

He settled into his seat and began poring over‘

 ‘a. book through large, gold-bowed spectacles,
' paying no attention to anything else. The girl,
{in ing that the chatelame bag at her belt was
“empty, gave him a quick nudge and whispered:
}'_  “Have you any change? I have lost my
a urse.” - .
 pr “Eh? What’s that, my dear?” and the‘ old
‘ ‘gentleman suddenly aroused himself. '
' ,“Won’t you pay for the fare? I have lost
'iny purse.” ~ . _
“Certainly, my dear, certainly,” and the gentle-
thrust his hand into his.trousers pocket
without. producing anything therefrom. _
“Why, bless my heart, I do believe I’ve come
‘away without any change,” he muttered, as he

Essex. “This is Mr. Wills, my first oﬂicer. You

Harry Essex continued: _ _
“Now that you are here I wish you to remain,

 plenty of sea room before it comes. I am only

wind whistling throughthe rigging, the air being

After breakfast Phil went on deck‘ and saw a

  

forward.

It turned as he reached it, and to his utter
amazement he beheld the pretty face of Sadiea
Hunter. ‘ '

“Why, Phil, I mean Mr. Freeman, did on."
change your mind, and sail on the Polaria a ter

“No; but you have evidently changed ours, .
Miss _Sadie, as this is not the Polaria at all, but i
the Pioneer.” 1

“Impossiblel Uncle Jerry asked ‘the steward .
when we came aboard last night, and we under- I.
stood him to say it was the Polaria. We went to» V 1 :
our cabins at once. They are next to each other. it
I went right to sleep, and slept gloriously, but I
am afraid that poor Uncle Jerry is awfully sick.
I could hear him groanin this morning. ‘I am
awfully glad you_,came. id your friend‘come,.

 

“Certainly. We are both members of the »
company. I don’t know'how we_ are going to
manage about you, though. You will hardly ‘want

“Phil Freeman, are you joking?” * r if;
“I was ”never more serious in all my life. Look
up there. _ * ._
On the pilot-house, just below the brid e, was
a board, bearing in gold letters on a blacﬁ back-'
ground the name: , .

“PIONEER.”

“Merciful sakes!” cried‘ Sadie. “How” on eart
did Uncle’ Jerry make such a mistake? And I
came along to lookafter him!” E ’

’ The Maniac Witness
Tom Brown was not: exactly a maniac, though

it that is what the good people of the village of D-
» called him. He was rather a harmless sort of

, fellow, who had been out of his mind for ever
1 n so long a period, and’ was allowed to roam at
. liberty, an object of compassion for the charitably
, inclined, and the sport and butt of the young and
‘ careless.
.  In his simple way he was as faithful as a dog
‘ C to those who treatedhim kindly, and to no one
' was he more attached than to Mary Wallace, the
b1acksmith’s daughter. ’

. Mary was a bright, buxom lass of eighteen or
' thereabouts, and secretly -in love with Paul Dan-
" yers, the only son of Squire Danvers, who was at
the same time the richest man in town and the
\ magistrate of the county;'but to humoinll/lad Tom
V she promised to marry him as soon as he could
count to. a hundred and repeat his letters. ’
. ‘. It was ludicrous to observe with what assiduity
‘v ,_the ‘poor lunatic——who, by the way, was the same
age as Paul, that is, twenty—two or --three—cud-
geled his .poor, shattered brains to fulﬁll these,‘
. “ to him, arduous conditions. Every scrap of‘ pa-
 ” per he came across he would preserve V and
 show it to Mary and ask her to explain it to‘ him.
,   »Meanwhile strange things were happening in
Z the little village. ‘Squire Danversj had had a
» . ' bitter quarrel with the blacksmith; hadforbidden
 * his son even to speak to’ Mary, onpain of disin-
_{ heritance andhad been’ seen in close conversation
’ ‘T ~ with old Sykes, 13. money-lender and reputed miser,
who lived in anpold tumble-down shanty on the
’ routskirts of the village. The next day Sykes had
" ; presented for payment to the blacksmith an old,
, overdue mortgage, which the honest mechanic
- had long and in vain tried «to liquidate».
,; interview was a stormy one, and the miserleft
 - Lthe ‘smithy threatening to begin foreclosure pro-
 ‘ 'ceedings,on' the following day. " T
' ' Dan .Wal1a,ce, as might be naturally supposed,
was greatly downcast by- this threat, and.when
, night settled down on the village bade his daugh-
» *.ter an affectionate adieu, and taking his gun with
* hind, started off for the nextvillage, which was
some ten miles away, to see a friend residing
there, -who might possibly lend him the sum re-

’ quired by the miser._ \ _ - , V
.  At ten o'clock that night, a belated villager
 . passing by near old Sykes’ shanty heard the re-
 . port of a gun, then a cry for help and hasten-
',/ . ing into a clump ofbushes behind the house; from

 

_on the ground, the dead‘ body of the miser, while’
'7 bendingover him, gleefully shouting andlaughr

book which he had just picked u , ‘and als a.
small’ piece of half-burnt and .c, arred: pa 
which had evidently formed a portion of‘ thew, ,
in the gun. These articles he managed to seer’ "
about his person without the others perceiving.
‘ The dead body of the miser was removed to-.h
