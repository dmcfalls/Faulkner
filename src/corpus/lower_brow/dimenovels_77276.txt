wire aloft, and then he began searching
over the surface of the court ﬂoor. 3 M t ,
He founda broken piece »of’ﬂagging"_at _ ,

had dropped with him, and lengthened’ 
this out with the pieces that had sectired '
his limbs.‘ . V. -‘ ,  -

whirled round and round it about three

for the lower dangling end. ..  ;  

" On two former occasions Bob.‘ ‘had,
utilized wiresto help him out of’ trou_,ble'.” 

Once he had slid clear acroﬂssthe street 
on a slanting wire, .pursued"‘5y a .man_a

The tracks rounded a group of aban-

ANOTHER NEW IDEA 

The Shield \<Veekly

TRUE DETECTIVE STORIES

Are ’stran_ger than ﬁction. THE SHIELD VVEEKLY is a new series of Detective Stories, but it is
“ somethin different.” Street & Sn1ith’s long experience in the publishing business has taught
them that (‘I8 average man and boy like nothing better than good dalcriioc stories. We have, in
the past, published many of the Oiti style, where the detective passes through a series of marvelous
and lmirbrenclth escapes and ﬁnally secures his quarry. THE SHIELD WEEKLY will, however, be an
absolutely ww dcpartizre. Each and ever number of the weekly will contain a history of 2
complete and intricate crime, the solution 0 which is worked out by the skill and ability of/ti): j

detectives. .
THESE ARE TRUE STORIES‘

absolute chapters of experience taken

" from the note books of the greatest
* and most noted Chiefs of Police in

‘the largest cities of America-$336‘

Their fund of knowledge uvon this subject has been drawn upon by special arrangnm{ut. ' We
propose to demonstrate to t e reading public of America through the SHlELD WEEKLY that the true

isiories of real crimes caulaiu as umc'h.mxd more of romance than do the inmgz'1i'a1‘ive iiales
which have been constructed in the past by ihe wi'im’s of daiecliw slorivs. We feelthat the ,
time is ripe for the presentation of this absolutely new class of detectivejziles. The first nury;‘a;rs~ -
in this seriesvwill consist of manuscripts from records in the archives of the Boston police, as T§.'PY3*':,‘

fact, throu hout America, as one of H16 s/7re'wdest uud most clever Secret 5¢’l"Di(.'£’, Oﬂiciais inthe," .
