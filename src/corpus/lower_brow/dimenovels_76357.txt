again they -would part in quick order. .The man-

date put a. damper on Sid’s speculative ambi
. He stopped short and had no’ expectation
of resuming. The fever, however, was in his
blood, and though Sid meant to hold the whip»
hand over his tendencies to speculate, he was
not equal to the test. When the B. & O. tip came
his way his good resolutions proved-" no ‘mor
stable than a foundation of shifting sand; He
yielded to the temptation, and he was now u
against the consequences. ,

He was not a squealer and could take his medi-«
cine like a major. At any rate he had a thou—L
sand dollars up on B. & O.»and he was alread"
$500 ahead on the deal, so he could take 1113»
bounce philosophically from a ﬁnancial‘stand
point. Furthermore, as his father held a respon

family in good shape, it didn’t make any diﬁ°er~’
ence if he was not able to turn in his wages reg?

wouldn’t stand for him being ‘out of a job if the
became aware of the fact, and his fatherﬁwas.

his discharge. I
“I’ll keep the matter quiet for the present,

At half-past three Sid ﬁnished his duties for
the day, and then started for a lunch house to
get 'a sandwich and a cup of coffee before going
on his errand. The, notewas addressed to a
Water Street wholesale house not far from the
Brooklyn Bridge, and Sid didn’t expect it would

, take him long to cover the distance. He entered
Wthe warehouse ﬁve minutes after four, handed
thenote to the cashier. in the counting-room and
then walkd out again. As he started up a side
street where there was a tall cheap tenement
house he saw a crowd of ragged urchins around
the door looking into the dirty entry. The
screams. of a girl inside had evidently drawn
them to’ the spot.

rescue her from the clutches of such a villainous, '

that his chances of doing so were decidedly slim.
_v—’One afternoon a broker named Carter, who was
on friendly terms with Sid, and knew how the

5 “VVell, Sid, how is the market treating you?”
he asked. ~ _ ‘

“All right, Mr. Carter, I’ll be on hand,” replied

At the appointed time S'd called at Carter's
,,o;i’ﬁce and was shown into his private room.’

.“Sit down, Sid.’ The favor I wish you'_to do for

me -is this; Do ‘you see that package?” said
Erbker Carter, pointing to a small packet on his

".“I surely do,” replied the boy. ' '

‘ “-Well, I want you to. take it to the home of a

The clouds mounted higher and higher as »

Sid got out, but he didn’t like to do/it.z~

H !l’that Sid could make out about her was that

without the aid of something to stand on, so he .
started to look for a box, or something else that 
would serve the same purpose. There was noth- 
ing/of the kind in the cellar. He opened a door{ ~»,
he came to and striking a. match saw a ﬂight of«- 
wooden steps before him. There was a door at?"-
the head of them, and Sid ventured to walk up
and open itto see where it led. It opened on a
hallway, and Sid found that fact out by strik.
ing a match-. There was a door at either end 0!.‘ .
this passage and one on the right side. Also a. 
ﬂight of stairs communicating with the next 
story. A dull gleam of light shone under the
side door, so Sid judged that that door connect-'_
ed with the public room. The door ahead he‘
ﬁgured opened on the road in front of the house
That was his avenue of retreat, so he was about:
to start for it when there came a, smart pound‘-*

convenient. Sid heard a man’s steps issue from

      
  
      
    
  

the door on which the knock’ had come. The"
knocking wasrepeated. ’, ’
“I suppose that’s Jim Poynders,” thought Sid.
“In fact it can’t be any one else. I’d like.to_
catch a sight of his face so I'll know him if!’
ever see him again.” i ' 5
It was Jim Poynders, and when he got toth T
door, he drew the bolt, turned the key and peered
out. ' .“ , ~ - V.
“Who’s there?” he asked grulﬁy. 
“A stranger. My auto broke down a short,

several neighbors seized Sally and J immy by their

_ The Lesson Which George Failed to ‘Learn. .

On his way back home, Jimmy Watson went”
by the way of his swe'etheart’s residence, and .

told her what the seriff had said to him.
“Oh, Jimmy,” said she, “it's awful, isn't it?’
“Yes, so it is; but I hold myself blameless. in‘
the whole matter, and so does the sheriff. I new

just come from his home and found that some.of ,
George’s friends had already been,there with "
their story, but‘ the sherlif told me to go back ‘
home and rest quietly, as he was satisﬁed that 5
I even though George should die of his ‘wound,’ I 1

would be held blameless.”

“Oh,,I am so g1ad‘to hear that, dear,” saidhis
sweetheart. “I never heard of a man remaining
unconscious from falling with his head against
astone before.” ( / g _ 

“Nor I,. either; and I am puzzled. It may be
that the doctors don't know their business insuch
matters.” ' r ‘

“I was thinking ;of that, too, Jimmy, although
I have always believed that Dr. Allen was a ﬁrst-.
rate physician." - ‘ _   ‘ *

“Yes; so have I. But under the’ same‘circun1-1"
stances I would act again just as I did last
night.”‘ , " J

“Of course; of course; no one ‘can justly blam
But how does your mother feel aboutgit,
Jimmy?” '  .:‘

'f,‘Oh,_she’s frightened, of course, and app ‘
But I don’t believe that the
worst is going to happen,” and Jimmy slyly sto '
a kiss from Sally, as she leaned over the gate, and
then started off toward his own home. ~

That stolen kiss covered Sally’s face W1,
blushes. ~ It was justwhatshe wanted. ’—

V When Jimmy reached ‘home he found,his m _
er’s face much brighter than when he left to go
to the home of the sheriff. 3 ' ‘

“Jimmy,”'said she, “Mrs. Jones has ‘just se
me ‘word that George has recovered from .
sW.oon, and is swearing to get even‘ with you
the first opportunity.” a _ ,, , I V

“Well, that’s good news. I’ll run back down
the road and tell Sally about it, for». I met:he
at the gate as I was coming home, and she,

very much worried,” and with that he turned a d‘-

ran almostat the top of his speed‘down the r
toward the Holmes residence. , ”
As he reaclied the gate he sung out:
“Sally, Sally!” k . - ' '  
Sally was inside the house, engaged in hon,
holdwork, but she ran to the door, calling. on
‘»‘,What-[is it, Jimmy?” I ~ ‘ ‘ _. ' -
. “Why, Mrs. Jones has just sentyword to;mot

carxie; to 3/he front door, and seeing the situation
exc aime : .
“What has brought you back again, Jimmy?”
 7‘Why, mother,” exclaimed; Sally, “he has come
back to tell us .good' news. George has come out
ofiihis swoon, and gone to his home swearing that
ihe, will get even with Jimmy the very next time
_ he meets him.” * ' -
;ﬁ“1\17nVel1, that means another’ ﬁght,” said Mr.

I “Yes,” said, Jimmy. “I suppose he will get

“Jimmy, why in the world don’t you have him

arrested and put under bond to keep the peace? ,

The law will let you do it.”
‘~"‘Well, I think that it is time for him to do
V that,” replied Jimmy. “His own folks don’t think
enough of the matter to; take some ‘steps to make

 " ' consequences.” 5 '

and historical information forms the greater part,
of the contents of almanacs, which are used mosh 0’

Almanacs date back to early civilization. It is

The Almanach Liegeois was typical in that it.,.
contained direprophecies. This almanac, which‘_
became famous by predicting the end of Mme. Du
Barry's care.r, found a great circulation in-rural
France and provided for those who could not read IF‘!
an easily comprehensible system of symbols. «
great was the inﬂuence of these almanacs over the‘

',/BASS VIOL PLAYERS USE -VAN T0
=» ' TRANSPORT INSTRUMENTS

-Gone, apparently, _are the days when we used c

_see,now and again, a poor wretch struggling‘
beneath the ciimbrous weight of, a bass viol bound
for rehearsal or performance, the very size of his
strange instrument preventing him from
‘aboard an ordinary conveyance. t

‘eldly bull ﬁddle (-as it,is sometimes call-ed) is
packed, in a padded trunk and transported by a
Van; ' T ‘

4 _one of the sights of the town last Winter was
the ﬂight of abass viol performer—or contrabas-
sist‘ to give him his digniﬁed orchestral name-
up‘ ifth‘ Avenue in one of the few remaining open
'ba—i_{ouches in New York, clinging to his monstrous
ﬁddle while the ancient driver urged his steod to
‘atgallop. There had been a hurry call for a con-
trabassist at a concert and no other vehicle that

transported passengers could accommodate the in- _

ruinent except the old barouche. , . J

Why.an'ybody studies the bass viol is _a musical
 tery. Savevfor enthusiasts inlwhose family
itihas been played probably for generations, this
huge .and.deep-toned instrument offers no melodic
range to charm the ear, and its quality is hardly
suchtas to give pleasure in solo work. . _
, It is_ indispensable, however, as a thunderer in
the orchestra, and for tonal background other-
wise unattainable. Both Wagner and Tchaikovsky
employed it a great deal in their scores, and for

 music of Wagner, the dragon in “Siegfried,”

"the bass viol is perfection..’

I Incidentally, playing it is hard work and calls
tor ﬁngers .of leather in the left hand and an
no -muscled right arm. T . _ ,» 1 _
