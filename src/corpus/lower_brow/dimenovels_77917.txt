then and followed the wire, which had been bent and ,

, twisted in all conceivable shapes, but which extended suf-

lﬁcierltlyi far into the ‘street even yet to indicate that the .

would-be murderer hadstationed himself somewhere on»

the opposite side of the street while he awaited the ar-
rival of the detective.
But the general upheaval, the shock that came with it

and the tramping of thousands of pairs’ of feet had, of‘

course, moved the wire suﬂiciently far from its original

position, so that from it it was impossible to tell just".

 CHAPTER .III.
A woMAN’s DEFIANCE.

When Nick Carter entered the‘ library, Olga was stand-

 beside the table idly turning over the leaves of a

I magazine, but she raised her eyes to his the moment he

entered, and smiled at him as she might have donehad

‘ shecalled there upon one of the most commonplace events
that might have happened.

"‘I' am very glad to know that you are uninjured, Mr.’

. Carter,” she said. V
,,“No doubt,” replied Nick coldly, for he had deter-
irnined to assume an attitude of suspicion for the occa-

sion, believing that he might force her ’-to say more‘

thanusvhe had intended to do when she came there.
“There._ was nobody injured, was there?” she inquired,
purposely avoiding the insinuation of his previous reply.
I’ V , “No.” ‘
. -“Your house is rather badly wrecked, Mr. Carter.”
“Yes.” , I
“Am I to understand by your attitude that you at-
tribiite this outrage to me 3”

 

W I for it,” he answered.
.;_,“If you mean by that that you think it was done by
peoplepwho think as 1 do," you are correct, but if you

‘mean to insinuate that I ‘had any knowledge of such an

«intention, you are entirely wrong.” . , '
W_Nic_k bowed his head coldly, ‘butidid not reply in

, ‘_’You do not believe me?” she asked.

I f‘I have notsaid that I do not.”\

_, .“Your manner implies it.” _, I
" “The implications" of another, as we sometimes un-
derstand them, Miss Dovanief, are apt to be tlre'“»'resul,t
‘of our own. fears concerning‘ the matter.” I

‘ ;She looked at‘ him steadily for a moment. Therewas I
not the slightest tinge of fearin her gaze: It was level V

-"alnddirect and ‘full ofjearnest purpose. She said:

V i.“i.A.S ‘soon.as I was told of what had happened here,

‘‘‘That is perhaps true,” she said musingly, “but, even

himself at once that she would have said nothing to be-
tray them, even under the circumstances she abhorred..- :.
He lingered in the library a few moments, strolling .
up and down the room in deep thought concerning Olga V f
and her environment, and he toucheid~ tentatively with i
his ﬁngers the leaves of the magazine she had turned
and the chair she had occupied, conscious of .a ‘latent
force thatlshe had left behind her when she took. her
departure so suddenly. V , _  __
Olga Dovanief affected the detective strangely. He A
saw in her a fanatic who was soydevoted tothe cause
she espoused tliatishe would hesitate at nothing to" further A. 

She was one, like that other Olga who has been men- '
tioned, who would consider personal freedom, her‘ life, ,_
and even her honor and reputation as nothing when 
compared with the success of her ambitious hopes, and 
he mentally decided in’ that moment that if she did
choose to make good her escape from the country he VV
would personally make no search to bring her back to it} pl.
to suffer for a crime in which she had really taken no 

part. i ' ' . . . Al
For being an accessory after the fact in the commis-
sion of a ‘crime such as that one was is merely, and in V
this case was, the result of 'the affection for those im- ' ‘5
plicated rather than sympathy\witlr the crime itself, and
hence there was no real guilt. - 5 . l_
When, a little later, he returned to Chick, ’_WhO was 
still waitingin the study for him, he recounted ‘in detail‘
the’ conversation which had occurred between Olga and’ 
himself, to all of which Chick listened with the abstract
' air of one who is concerned with other things; ‘but V
when the detective'~told of Olga’s deﬁant answer in which- 3 ‘
she had stated that sheshould return to Russia within”
the next thirty days, no matter what the‘ consequences
‘might be, Chick exclaimed ratherzmeaninglyz I V
“It is to be hoped, Nick, that she will take her sym-i
pathizers into her conﬁdence about this intended ﬂight of’
hers.”_ 4 ' M ' ‘
“Why so?” asked the detective. I ' 
“Because, if she disappears without imparting the
I Vgknowledge of her intentions to any one, they are likely to‘
misconstrue her absence.” . * ’/I I :  z,

- “Dop’t you know what explanation they will be likely

V“They will know that she came here to see you, won’t
they?”

acquainting her friends of what she 'ntends toido, they
will, as you say, believe that. she has been arrested and
placed‘ in solitary conﬁnement as political offenders’ are
treated in the cities of Russia; and, of course, in suchan
event, they will hold me guilty. of the act,‘and I think,
also, that in that case we will be likely to have our
hands pretty full of Russian affairs until Olga chooses
to communicate with some of her friends who are here
in this country.” ‘
“And therefore?” asked Chick, pausing for the de-
tective to finish his sentence. I , i I ,
“And, therefore,” continued the detective, “unless we
want another experience with dynamite and infernal ma-
chines very shortly, I think it behooves us to lose no
time in. rounding up the people who paid us that little
compliment this afternoon.” I ' v . 5 '

the two detectives descended to partake of it, so there

was no further discussion of these matters‘ until. that}
was disposed of, save the few references that were made '
to it on the part of Patsyandi Tenglchi during the meal.- ’

The front of the house was patched up as .well-as

possible for the night, with timbers that were brought .

there for that purpose, and a policeman sent by‘ the"

captain of the precinct stood guard outside on the pave- _

m/ent, although Nick regarded this act as a waste of
time and energy. A . i ‘I I

‘the man away, and then he returned to his own room,
‘and from that gazed into the one lately occupiedby

Chick, and from which he had been so mysteriously
spirited away. As yet, the detective did not arouse the

. other members of his household, for incidents ‘were pass-

ing so swiftly relative to these Russian nihilists who had

' pitted themselves against him that he was glad of the
- opportunity to be alone until he could think over care-

fully all that had occurred. 

It must be remembered that the explosion of the pre-
ceding day had so wrecked the house .’of the detective
that the way was open for anybody to enter it from

the street who caredl to do so, and that, therefore, there

was no impediment to the attack of the nihilists‘ when

i the policeman who had been placed on guard was once
i ’ disposed of. ~ /,,

Nick believed that he could undersfand'perfectl'y how

‘ the attack had been made, for a policeman on guard, as

this one who had been stricken down, might be easily ap-
proached by one or by even two men on the street while
he was there, since thepoliceman would not expect such

a th-ing as an .open attack upon him. A He would have nog
reason to do so. ‘

He would regard his presence there as merely’ a pro-

tection to the house itself and not of the occupants par-

ticularly; his mere presence he would regard as suffi-
cient to keep any chance night prowler from attempting
to enter the building. l

There was no doubt that the men who had committed
the outrage of the preceding afternoon understood per-
fectly well that no results had "come from it save the

 demolition of the {front stoop and h part of the front
of . wall of the house; there was no doubt that they knew

perfectly well that no fatalities had resulted, and so
that it would now be a very easy matter to, gairifa -
mittance to the house once the policeman who‘ guarded:

With the‘ warning that Chick had uttered the pre-

, ‘ceding afternoon fresh in his mind, the/detective could ‘I
  not ,but determine that Olga had done as they thought

she. might, that is, she had chosen to disappear, fiéom her

friends as well as to escape from the conseque ces’ ofdier
‘association with the murder on the‘East Side of the

city; \, y r '

3lDoubtless,” Nick said to himself, while he stood peer-
ing into Chick’s room, “these men knew perfectly well

when Olga came here to call upon me in order to deny" '
C  ‘personal participation in the! dynamite‘ outrage, and it is L

also likely that she had promised to see one or more of

“Possibly they may have thought that I had detained

their original incentive fbr theirvisit here during the
night, but if that is so, and if they searched the house,
for they would be likely to do that if they were looking
for her, I cannot understand why I, or some of the
oth‘ers,’was not aroused.  "
“Their belief that Olga was a prisoner in this house
from the beginning, would explain also the abduction
of Chick, for not ﬁnding her here, and believing him to
be me, they would reason that if they got him into their
power and could carry him away into captivity to do with
him as they ple‘sed, still believing him to be Nick Car-
ter, they could force him by torture or otherwise, not only
to tell them where she was imprisoned, but perhaps ‘to
aid them deﬁnitely'in their efforts to free her.
“I think this is an explanation of the present situation-
of affairs.” I . . 3

systematic search of it; but the intruders, whoever they
may have been, had left nothing behind them to indicate,

It was nearly ﬁve o’clock in the morning when the des.

tective discovered the unconscious policeman outsideyvhis 

house, and it had been twelve o’clock at night when

TI-IESTRANGER ON CENTER STREET., . ,. 

 
  

There was a sense of defeat in Nick Carter’s 
when he left the Tombs and strolled slowly down Center
Street to the Subway station at the Bridge. '  7,

He realized that the settled beliefs of these: Russians , 
amounted to an obstinate condition of mind which waS.g““‘

, practically as immovable by argument as superstition.;r  

They could not be disabused of theidea thatpthewcus-T ’"
toms of their own country obtained in others, and it was 
evidenttto Nick that even Michael Orloff was convinced
in his own mind that Olga Ddvanieflhad ‘been».spirited 

%away to solitary conﬁnement, where she was to 
indeﬁnitely, or, perhaps, be quietly put out of the way for-V
ever, as islfrequently ‘done with political prisoners 
Russia. , , ' T . I T - . T. Li: 

V The detective realizedpfully th t the nihilists had ‘made i

 9, mistake in theirabduction of  ick, and that they were
now aware of it, for there was no doubt,='particularly_
since he had talked with Dovanief and Orloff, that it ,
had been the intention of the~terrorists\o secure posses T
sionlof the person of hirnself, Nick Cartier. I  1

T  realized, also, how utterly impossible litl~lwias,, or’;

, would be, to make either of the imprisonedenihilistsktallc be

sufficiently to afford the detective any» clue concei-hinge the 5
place where Chick was detained, and ‘he had 
enough from both of the men to convince hirn/that,
/Madam ﬁovanief‘ was ignorant of their plots and plans\,i.
i and therefore it would be useless for him‘ to interview.ii7
her. 1  ' N’ w V
b _There was absdlutely no basis what-ever upon which

_ s "But nowwith the incident that has just been so par‘-
lticu‘lar1y' described, many new suggestions concerning the
case came to Nick Carter. ‘

i‘ There: was just this one chance, as alreadydescribed,
that this stranger who had passed him, and who was un-
questionably a foreigner,‘did know the Olga in ‘whom
Nick was interested. N ‘

Acting upon the impulse of the moment, Nick at once
followed the man who had so suddenly interested him

,.without'any real‘ reason for doing so, save that which
has already been- described, and which did not even pos-

 sess the attraction of being logical.

f  The two men were just south of the southeast corner
of the two streets described when ‘the incident occurred,
Iand,it was justias the stranger reached the corner and
stepped‘, from the curbing upon the roadway that Nick
turned to follow him. 1,

V V, The man went diagonally across the street to the north
isicleiof Chambers and’ then followed it rapidly along

3 toward Broadway, with Nick Carter only a few rods be-
hind him. e

17.: it And now the detective‘ performed one of those miracles .

 

: in his appearance for which he was renowned among his
‘jfeglilows, but for whichpof late he had had so little use.

   
 
 
   
  
    
  
   
 
  
 
   
   
  
  

Ly  unusual degree of intelligence, and although the blue
 ‘eyes’ had rested upon him but" an. instant, the detective
' did not ddubt that they would recognize him again with
a second glance. i

 

.,;'Therefore, while he walked rapidly along behind the
dtranger, he removed the soft hat from his head‘ and car-
ried  in his hand for a moment, folding it into a compact
.mass as hedid so and presently depositing it in one of
islpockets, from which at the same time he produced a.’

yet suﬂiciently in evidence to giveja decided appearance, «

It may seem to the reader- that these changes ’’were in-_
signiﬁcant, for the detective hadno opportunity to Chang J M
any part of his clothing save his head-wear. ' ‘

But one of the theories of the detective in making,
quick alteration in his appearance was tnotﬂto changeji M
too‘ much, and he would not have ‘hesitated now to hav _
passed around directly in front of the stranger who had A 
interested him and to have permitted the‘ latterto studig, 
himclosely. N; '« ’ ;  4

The alteration thatlhad been made was just suﬂicierit F A 7'
for the needs ofvthe moment, and although the (stranger, ’
had he looked at Nick now, might have been puzzled to V
know where he had seen the facelbefore, there ‘was still‘ i 7
sufﬁcient change in itsrappearance so that he would
have associated it with the man who had cried in his’.
ear: “Olga, of course!” V " _ l A l 

The two passed rapidly through Chambersisitreet to
Broadway, where the straiiger at once boarded a ino_*rth#’,7 -,5
bound car and Nick climbed into a seat directly behind
him. i  N

 
  
  
   
   
 
    
  
   
   
  
 

The man remained uponthe carhuntil they arrivedlat}, V

‘ VNICK cARri~:R’s TIMELY INTERFERENCE.

. . I
T. the most important and far—reach1ng results of the prac-

se of his profession have happened by accident, or at
least have had the appearance of accident at the time of
the occurrences. L _ .
H He had taken up the chase of this man on the impulse
of the moment and without a deﬁnite reason for doing so,
save merely the unimportant one that the stranger had

1 '' manifested interest in the name of Olga. ,

The appearance of the man would have argued against a

' the detective’s conduct on this occasion for the reason

that he was tall and elegantly dressed, and if his general
appearance was any criterion at all,,was somewhere a.
person of considerable consequence, while on the other
hand the people with whom Olga had been associated

it had rebounded before the latch caught.

“It is the most, natural thing invthe world,’’_ he told!
himself, “that Olga, upon regaining her liberty, should

Satisﬁed in his own mind now that the man he had

‘encountered so fortunately an,d,yeti so strangely on the.
streethad led~him\ directly to Olga, the detective‘ did not“

hesitate about‘ following him at once into this house; nor

ldidzhe attempt to do so by stealth.

He had practically permitted her the opportunity pf;
making her escape from the country whenih; let her dee I
part from his house as she did the preceding evening,'iand

for that he considered that she owed him something——-‘,.;

something which she could repay adequately by informal-i_

‘~ 'Nick had stepped forward a little bit so that hecould

now see into the room, and was watching Olga when she

 replied with ﬂashing eyes: '
_ \  “And I say, Strovanoff, that it shall not be l”

7'  The tall stranger shrugged his shoulders and smiled
iicoldly, showing his white teeth as he asked in a voice
that was so softly spoken that it was almost a caress:

' “Do you venture to defy me, Olga? To defy Strova—
" noff? Do you realize the danger in which you stand when
you ‘dare to speak to‘ me as you have done just now?”
‘ She clrewa little bit farther away from him and Nick
detected for ‘one instant a gleam of fear in her eyes, and
he did not wonder at it, for the name of Strovanoif had
carried terror to many braver hearts than hers; but she
answered him boldly:

“I dare even Strovanoif; even you, unscrupulous and /
implacable as you are, when I believe the cause Idupholel
I is right! And I say to you now, no matter what the con—-
sequences may be, that if you carry out what you have
threatened to do, and put to death this man who is in
your power, you will get no furtheii service from Olga
Dovanief!” 1 _, L _ .
“What!” he exclaimed. “You dare? You defy me ?”
“Yes,” she retu‘rned,=boldly,i “I do 1” i
, There was something suggestive of the grin of a wolf
’ V in the. smile that swept aC1'iOS§ the Russian’s face at this,

7 and he remarked in that same soft and purring voice:

7‘. “Defiance of iS'trovanofr' is a serious thing, Olga, for it
is deﬁance of everything that I represent, as well asyof
me. Refusal to serve me. further is refusal to serve dur-
cause, and that implies that you~.are ready to become a
traitor, and means death.” I 

v _ p . Olga was perceptibly paler now, but she looked him if

L calmly in the eyes as she replied: ,
‘ “And still,I defy you, Strovanotf, for on my soul I
believe you to be a traitor yourself l”i ‘ j /'

i‘ The smile on the man’s faceichanged to as snarl, and,

 if/»’ with the quickness of a cat, he darted forward and seized
her wrists in both hands, grinnihg into her now thor-.,
oughly frightened face. . I, I p

STROVANOFF, THE NIHILIST CHIEF.

Strovanoff started back and released his hold upon Olga
for an instant, dismayed by the interference and the char-
acter of it; but he recovered his remarkable compo-
sure instantly while he ﬁxed his cold eyes searchingly on ‘
the ‘detective. I

Olga, the instant she was released from the grasp that

had been upon her, leaped backward and away from
Strovanoff, so that as the three stood thdre in the center

of the room, they formed the three points of a triangle.
Nick had forgotten for the moment the faet that he,
had quite materially changed his appearance, but now as.
he recalled it, he raised his hand swiftly, tore away the
false mustache and dropped it negligently into one of his
pockets. - ' V
'- “Mr. Carter!” exclaimed Olga, and she was the.ﬁrst
to speak after Nick’s surprising salutation. j V
q “At your service,” replied the detective, bowing his
head slightly, but keeping his; eyes upon the tall stranger,
who at that moment had every aspect of a panther,

"ready to spring and‘, tear. .

“Ah,”.said Strovanoﬁ, raising one hand and stroking _.

_/ his militarymustache, “I recognize you now; youare the
Arman who uttered the name of Mademoiselle Dovaniefj‘

when I passed you on» the street in the lower partjrof 
the‘: city.” / ~ , , i 

“Your shrewdness does you credit, Strovanoﬁ,”  
plied Nick, and the Russian started. , if ‘x, , -

 

  
 
  
  
  
   
 

“S0,”, he said, and there was something threatening’

 

I am, do you?” \ _
“Certainly,” replied the detective. 1
i “It is rather a dangerous knowledgeito possess’, 
man, unless our friend Olga can satisfy me that‘.you 92‘

Nicki smiled broadly upon the Russian and responde

“I have followed,you,,” replied Nick evasively, “it does
inot matter since when.” I A V I ‘
“So you have, perhaps, been on my track all the morn-
ing; possibly ever since I arrived in the country.”
Nick smiled again, as much as to say that it was quite

possible, although he made no ‘reply, but after a moment‘

I of silence he said:

1 “I arn.not interested particularly in your affairs, Stro-
hvanoff, although I feel a distinct interest in you just
at the present moment. I know that you are no safer in
I this country than you are in your own, for there is more

HI shall give myself the pleasure of placing you under

to answer for some of the crimesyou have committed.”
I Strovanoﬁ took one step backward, as if to place a
grieatert distance between himself and the detective,’ and
he replied coolly: , '
“Yzoutalk largely, Mr. Nicholas Carter.”
,“I’ speak to the point,” replied the detective.

I “There has been a shifting of the scene, Mr. Carter,”
said the Russian calmly and apparently none the worse
for his recent rough experience. 4 ‘

“So it would appear,” replied the detective, as coolly as
he had spoken; and at the same instant he glanced past
I the men who surrounded him and observed that Olga,
. who was behind them all, was making rapid signs to
’ 7 him to lie quietly and submissively where he was.
Strovanoff looked down upon him with. the wolﬁsh
t smile curling his lips and continued:
L “It seems now that we will have two for our evening
1, V sacriﬁce, and I cannot tell you how overjoyed I am that
I I have succeeded in getting Nick Carter certainly in my
power.” I
The’ detective made no reply; . _
7 ‘_‘You see, Carter,” continued the man easily, “you
pifvknow altogether too‘much about me for my welfare in

All this- time he kept the point of his weapon pressed

I be driven through his neck instantly. by

‘ NICK CARTER FIND$ A NEW ASSISTANT.

i ‘There was very little [ﬁght left in these‘ two men who
, remained to continue the ﬁght with Nick Carter, for it
must be remembered that one of them on the floor was
« senseless ‘where he had’ been struck" down by the de-
tective’s ﬁst, and the other had been used rather badly
where he had been hurled across the room and used as a
battering-ram. ‘ ,
Nick shook ‘them from his shoulders with something
of the angry impatience that a big dog would have mani-
fested toward a couple of curs that were snarling around,
 and he laid one of them low with a blow of his left
."ia,_‘x-‘in, and clapped the handcuffs ‘that Olga had used so
‘.éﬁ'§c,tively_t1pon' the other one. I if
And now he pulled some pictures from the walls and
utilized the cords with which they had been suspended
A to bind th)e others, and this done, he gave his attention to
Oh  m_ovab_le pier-glass past which Strovanoff had disap-
9‘ peared carrying Olga with him. i '  V

[always able to discover secret springs and entrances to
-T‘7miy'sterious passageways, for it was a part of_his' profes-

 ,to ‘make an . intricate and thorough study of such

‘But search as he might; he‘ could not discover the
secret of this one,‘and, convinced of that, "he presently
‘turned back toﬂhis captives. One of them, the man
iwho wore the handcuffs, seemedtrather more intelligent
int appearance than the others, and Nick shoved him back
into a chair and tiedrhim there so that he could not
move; ‘ ’ . 1

confronted by Strovanoff, who had darted forward‘ to in-
t tercept him. V . ‘ ' _
C In the first brief glance that the detective had of the
iriterior of the room, he discovered that he had unwit-
tingly come upon one of the n1eeting—places of ‘the Rus-
sian nihilists who foregather in New York. And he dis-
-covered, also, that besides Strovanoff, there were half a
dozen other men in the room. \ V ‘ V ,

Across it and overiagainst the wall, standing with her
hands behind her, as if they were bound,/and facing the

' gsmen who were gathered there, was Olga Dovanief, white
« faced, but with ﬂashing eyes and deﬁant attitude and
, spirit, as if she had indeed come to her last resourceand

There are different kinds ofpbeggars. Imperial beggars,‘or lac
yen ting--the words mean “old man’s button”-have probably
no Lparallelin the world, as! some of them are descendants of
the ancient Ming dynastyor distinctlyrelated to the present’
reigning imperial house. They are scatteredall‘ over the coun-
try,» are said to number upward; of xo,ooo,"and are specially
numerous in’ Peking. Imperial beggars are easily recogniLzecl,ﬂ
because they are allowed tolwear garments of the imperial yellow“
of different shades. Characters are painted in black» on the back i
and frontof their robes to Vdenotetheir‘ profession. They wear _
ther gistraw hat or a velvet cap ornamented with a brass but-'-Q’

 ton. V

‘When first ‘I saw them I took them 'to- be old degraded oLﬂiciLals,;
for there are hundreds of them ‘in Soochow.’ They, carry 3""
(wooden bell in theirhands to announce their arrival. As a rulLe{'5
they are overgsixty years’ of age and have no family to supporfzﬁ
them, and they are all‘ allowed to beg forymore money thin thef;
ordinary craft, and are furnished with a_ license from tl’l€:1'l,f,l3gi5*_~‘,‘

 
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
  
   
 
   
  
   
 
   
  
   
   

of the ordinary beggar chief. L ,, . V —
In Nankinthere is quite a select company of them’, the order

self. The: rise from beggar to ‘ernperor'proh_ably beats the record
of any dynastypin Europe. In‘ pious remembranceyof his?  ’

Besides, seeking alms these‘ lrnperial beggars go about; '
countryxand obtain a/‘livelihood by swearing ‘false oaths ihLLcouL '

Mac, Topsy, Diavoleno. These are the names of about as

' highly educated and as jovial a trio of baboons as you may hope

to encounter in the course of a yea'r’s‘march. They belong to
Herr Grais, a German gentleman in London, who, as a trainer
of_ wild animals, ranks second to none. Mac and Topsy are
veritable yvonders, the former being quite a celebrated acrobat.

He can walk the tight rope as easily as he can crack a nut or -

‘tear a piece out of your tailoring; he can turn a somersault on

._ thertight rope, and he can even undress himself without the as-

sistance of a valet.

Topsy is no less remarkable. She: makes an excellent parlor-

 maid. She runs away and fetches whatever articles her master

may require, she skips with a hoop, and, when_ she is in a frolic-
some mood, she imitates everything that her companion Mac

I is doing. As for Diavoleno, he loops the loop in really gallant

style. . ‘V
 fewdays ago a newspaper man had the pleasure of a.

/ tallc.with,Mr. Grais on the subject of these gifted creatures.

_ “I have six baboons,” said —Mr. Grais, in reply ‘to a query,

“but three of them I keep“, chieﬂy as understudies. N bw and then _

' Mac, Topsy, or‘-Iliavoleno is off color, and one of the others
appears as a substitute. Where did I obtain them? The ma-

" jority were purchased from dealers, while one was brought over

l:_:y;,a regiment of British soldiers on theftermination of the war
i’n*'South Africa.” « _

-x“Now, what’s the most diﬂicult thing that Mac does ?” asked
,th‘e_;correspondent. , I ‘A ‘

 "i‘The public imagine th  the soniersault on the tight rope is

. the, most difficult feat in“Mac’s repertoire, but they are wrong._
Thecleverest item in his performance is his undressing act. This ’

mi‘ olvesithe exercise of his brain, whereas the somersault, ex-

 

Itraordinaryias it may be, is a matter of strength and skill. I de-
voted two and a half years to training old: Mac.’ He recently
celebrated his sixteenth birthday, by the bye._

;j‘~‘,Firstly, I had to gain his conﬁdence. When" I bought him he
was very, wild—scared at the least,thing—so I made a fuss of

'liiigr;,rand‘ a friendly footing having been established, I induced

i1iixi1',iby degrees, to stand‘ up on his hind legs. : I showed him
What to do, and according to the amount of bribery fhat was
offered’ him,~.‘he obeyed my instructions. ' V

“After this I taught him to walk on his‘ hind legs, holding
him. up a little ‘by his fore legs to start with. All the» while I

encouraged him with kind words, and bribes in ‘the shape‘ of .

fruit, with the _,result that before long he swaggered about on

two. legs of his own ‘will. You see he was anxiousto be rqade .,
fusshof, and also to have an extra supply of fruit. Following‘

\‘thifs’he was put to jumping. To commence with, the bars he had

 

to leap over wereveryv low, but their height‘ was gradually:'in—

creased until he was capable of a really ‘high jump.
"An inﬁnitely more serious problem,” Mr. ,Grais continued,

by’ the blow of a poker, the frightful wound on the fore-
head showing that it had been inflicted by that instru-
ment which lay a few feet» from the crimsoned head.
Two chairs had been overturned, but there were no other
signs of a struggle.
I. bent over him, and gently raised his shoulders. I
saw he was faintly breathing, and poured some of.his
own brandy down his throat. But it was of no avail;
the was at his last grasp. He muttered: “Jack-—Jack——<

I'set out to rouse his wife, but there was no answer to
my calls, and a hurried search showed that Mrs. Max-
_ well was absent. 1' was alone in the house with the body.
‘ While wondering what I ought to do, Captain Amos
Burton arrived with the intention of engaging in his ‘fa-
_.vorite amusement with his old friend. He lived in the
direction of Farmingdale, so he had seen nothing of Jack
,,Risley. VVhile the captain was expressing his horror
 and sympathy, he told me that Mrs. Maxwell was visit-
! -ping his family, and intended to stay over night.
5 He had hardly said this, when Borden Kenneth, a
. young man ofabout my age, came in from the direction
 ‘ of Squan. He had met the nephew, who, upon being
” hailed, darted, aside into the woods without speaking.
A The funeral of Uncle Tom was one of the largest
“ ever held in that section of the country; The widow
hired aneighbor to help her keep the place going, but the
shocklof her husband’s death carried her off within a
few months. The man, after a little longer trial, gave
it up, and the once famous Blue Swan went to wreck
and ruin. A curse seemed to rest upon it from the day
of the landlord’s untimely taking off. ,
7 ._'_lack Risely was captured between Freehold and New
York, whither he was hastening to engage his services on
Ia coasting schooner. He strenuously denied being in the
vicinity of the Blue Swan on the night of the murder, but
when confronted by the testimony of Kenneth and my-
, self on the witness-stand, he confessed that he had‘ sworn
;to‘a falsehood, and told his story.
