saw at once that not a single spark of life
remained.

A telephone call ‘to headquarters soon
brought a policeman and a local detective to
the scene, and the entire household and
grounds were placed under guard.

Oscar Brownlie had been murdered in a
very peculiar way, so peculiar, in fact, that
for some time not one of tliosewrlio attempted
to solve the case could bring the A exact
method to light.

The coroner, who was also a doctor, ad-

He was commonly known as a musical in-

iuiug and purchasing old and rare violins,
tints, and the like, of which he had a
music-room in the mansion stocked full.

, This collection alone was known to be
it wbrth about eighty thousand dollars.

For the past six months there hadlived
with the old man an only nephew, Ralph
ipLarchmoud, the son of a younger sister.
‘Ralph, twenty years of age, had been left an
orphan with but a few dollars and a good
. many expensive habits. h
old Oscar Brownlie did not care much to
have him with him‘, but he owed it to his
7 sister's memory to give her some home. and

at that time of the night was another mys-
tery. excepting that he might have taken a
sudden notion to visit the stable to look at

the horses,oue of which had the day previous’

gone lame. .
Lannigan, the’ local detective, at once
began to question Jefferson Jens concerning
himself, and so frightened the colored man
that Jens lost his head entirely.
“It wasn’t me, sah, ‘deed it wasn't! I
,-wouldn't touch a hair ob MassawBrownlie's
head, sah!"

"‘ Well, if" you were in the stables you
‘must have seen somebody around the place
or in the garden."

, Thus approached, Jens didn't know but
what he had seen a man prowling round, a
man with a long ulster and a slouch hat.
But that was as far as Jens would go, even
to clear himself.

Lanuigan then made inquiries as to Ralph
Larchmond, and learned that Larchmond
was in the -habit of wearing a long ulster.

This caused him to suspect Ralph, and
from one of the servants he learned about

' the quarrel and how the young man was

preparing to move away.

That very evening he called on Streep,
the lawyer, the head of the firm for which
Ralph worked, and learned that Ralph was
his uncle's principal" heir. J

“As clear as a_ diamond,“ said Lannigan
to himself.

the thought of being left poor nerved his
hand to strike the blow--or, rather, to dose
his uncle to death. . .

"Now, that hing settled, the thing is to
fasten the crime upon him.”

And having thus reasoned out matters to
suit himself, this over-conﬁdent detective
went to work to gather in proofs against
Ralph.

The nephew of the murdered man turned
up at the mansion at hadf~past twelve.

ment it looked as if he was about to faint

But he recovered, and at gnce demanded to
know the particulars of the dastardly deed.
As far as they were known they were given
him, and then he himself was questioned.
He had but little to say. He said he had
been out of town, but did not mention the

concerning the doing of the deed were ad-
vanced. Half a dozen men began to work on

.the case, and to mention all of the clews

these people thought they found would alone
make a story.

Jans was placed under temporary arrest,
and so was the butler, who had been the
last person i? the mansion to see Brownlie

. alive. All of the other servants were closely

watched.
At the end of the two days the police had
four tramps in custody, under suspicion of

having committed thecrime. But a second

«examination of these fellows resulted in all

of them being able to prove alibis.

Then came an announcement that caused
several of the daily papers to issue extras.
Ralph Larchmond had been arrested for the
crime.

In large and leaded type the papers told
of Detective Lannigan’s remarkable work on
the case. How he hadisuspected Ralph from
the start and made many damaging discov-
eries concerning his habits, etc. More than
this, Lannigan had traced the whole course
of the great crime, the details of which,
however, were not to be given out until the
trial.

Ralph Larchmond was greatly excited
over his arrest, but opce -in a cell, he calmed
down. ‘He refused himself to all visitors but
one, a former college churn, Paul Hecker,
by name. A " . ‘

These two held a private conference which '
lasted over an hour.. Then Becker left the
jail, and did not return until the afternoon
of the following day.

Evidently he brought” discouraging news,
for a few minutes after he‘arrived. Ralph
Larclimond fainted dead -away. A hospital
doctor was called in, but it was a

"I have nothing to say,” was his reply.

This in itself created aﬁensation, but even 1

a greater one was to follow.

Lannigan -was called to testify as to the
pawn ticket. He said he had traced the mat-
ter up and learned that the ticket repre-
sented a watch which Larehmond had put
in pawn in Washington on the very night of
the murder, 4

. “He did this to obtain money, so that he
could show folks that he was not. in need.
The watch brought him. eighty dollars. It
was a ﬁne aﬁair and belonged to Oscar
Brownlie."

‘V At the announcement that he had gone to
Washington on the very evening of the mur-
der every one looked at Ralph Larehmond,

thinking this a good chance for the young’

man to attempt an alibi. p
They were dumfounded to see Larehmond

suddenly stagger to his feet with a facefrorn
which every particle of color had ﬂed.

“There is no use to go on with this case ‘

any longer,” be said, in a low tone, address-
ing the judge. “ I retract my former plea

and plead guilty.“

voices at once. . -’ ’

“MR. NICHOLAS CARTER, New York.City——

“Dear Sir: Although I am an utter
stranger to you, I feel that you will give
this communication your close attention. I
hope with all my heart that you will con-
clude to do as I desire when you have
thought the matter over.

“I wish you to take up the Oscar Brown-
lie murder case and prove the innocence of
Ralph Larchrnond. He has made a confes-
sion, but he is not guilty, that I am willing
to swear. L

“I am placed in sucha position that I
cannot reveal myself to you, and if you go
to Larclnnond I hope it will be with the
understa‘nd'ing that you will not let him
know that you were hired by some unknown
outsider. V

“There is a detective. here named Lanni-

told the truth so far as he knew, perhaps he

did not. I will leave that for you to ﬁnd out. a

The sheriff at once ledvthe way to the cell
in which Ralph Larchmond was conﬁned.
Without speaking to the prisoner, he opened
the door and allowed the great detective to
enter.

‘ ‘I pity the poor lad,” he whispered, “and
if you can do anything for him I hope you
will.” '

Once alone with the prisoner, Nick smiled
cordially and held out his hand. At a glance
he had ‘ ‘sized up” the young lawyers
clerk and made up his mind just how to
handle him.

Larchmond had been sitting with his head
between the palms of his hands. He sprang
up. with a puzzled look on his face.

‘ ‘You—-er—-—you have the heat of me,“ he
stammered, as he took the hand hesitate
ingly.

"So I have, Mr. Larchmond. Let me in-

At once the young man's face became
sober, ahd he set his teeth hard.

“They are very common hairs———reddish

them is totally out of the question, and it's
equally useless to look for a man with such

Going back to the garden, Nick gained an
entrance to the barn and looked at the horse-
ﬂesh there.

hairs did not come from here. A

What he had done or upon whom he had
called was not to be made known, even at
the cost of being able to prove an alibi.

Suddenly Nick arose.

“Here is your hundred. dollars, Mr.
Becker,” he said, and brought forth the bill.

“ Why——-er——you-——-—' '

“I decline to have anything more to do
with the case.” Nick placed the bill on the
table. “Good-day.”

“Hold on!” Becker caught him by the
arm. “Please don’t give it up, Mr. Carter.
I said I would pay the bill later on —when
I get my money—and I will, no matter

“It is not a questioii of ‘money, Becker,"

NICK CARTER WEEKLY,

Taking advantage of the gathering dark-
ness, Nick lost no time in gaining a side
porch, partlycovered with withered vines.

The window of the porch was tightly
closed, but, after ascertaining that the room
beyond was empty, Nick opened the catch
and noiselessly entered the house.

The room had once been a library, but
now it contained nothing more than a table
and half a dozen chairs. On the table stood
some wineglasses, and several packs of cards
were scattered about.

‘ “I-Iullo! here’s a little discovery!" said
Nick to himself. "A gambling den in a
country house. This is better than risking a
raid right in the heart of Washington."

A number of footsteps were heard in the
Nick

hind an empty bookstand in one corner
when the door opened and Paul Becker and
a woman entered.

The woman was not more than thirty-ﬁve
yearsiof age. Her face was highly powdered,
and she wore a loose gown above a shabby
pairof shoes, which were unbnttoned,

“I was hardly readyior visitors yet," she
said to Becker, in a soft, but not altogether
pleasing tone. “No one is expected until
nine or ten.” M

‘f’I‘hat is why I came early, Madame Le
Rue,” replied Becker. ‘ '

"I want to talkgto you alone."

“Please make yourselvesiat home." _

“We will, Mary,” returned a tall fellow.
“Conze‘on. Senator," he added to his com~

And two of the men walked into a side
room, followed by the third.

"Regular gamblers," was Nick's mental
comment. ‘ ‘And one of them a United States

"Evidently the house is well-known, and

to the rear out of sight, leaving the detective
in sole possession of the hall, which was but
dimly lit.

Waiting to make sure that he had not

From under‘ the door of a side room’
streamed a bright light, and Nick rightly
griessed that this room was the one in which

The man descended a back stairs which

It was blowing quite strongly outside,
and the indications were that it would soon

Down into the garden went the French-
man, with Nick but a few yards behind him.

Once the man looked back, as if afraid
some one from the house was following him,
but Nick had been prepared for this and was
out of sight behind a box hedge.

i“'I‘l1at fellow has a guilty conscience.”
‘said Nick to himself, “and it's not altogether
on account of the money he has taken.”

At the end of the garden stood a small
shed where horses could be tied up.

“Hello, gone!" he cried to himself.

 lenown United States Senator, reported to be

more reputable places.

The establishment was aroused, and in
some fear the servant answered the summons.

“I want the Senator!” cried Nick, rush-
ing _inside the house and up to the room.

“Want me?‘ Hullo, old man, what’s the
row ?” ’

“Come with me; you are wanted at a
special caucus, ” cried Nick.

“But I'm playing —-—-"'

“ Bother the game! Come on !”

And in spite of the Senatoﬂsprotéhtations,
Nicks made the man take up his money and
leave the ‘place. Nor would he listen to the
gamb1er’s rather mild threats for so doing.

But once away from the house, the Senator
demanded ‘an explanation:-and he got it—-
in a_ way that astonished him beyond meas-
ure.

He became sober enough to see the force
of all Nick told him, and did not need much
urging to leave for his home.

large plot of ground. On either side of it
was a long and high board fence,and behind
these fences wae situated the stables and
sheds.

Pierre passed up the porch of the resort
and tried the bar-room door. It was open,

‘and he disappeared within.

A burst‘ of wild laughter told Nick that a
merry crowd was present, and bnttoning up
his coat, he followed Pierre inside.

Half a dozen men were at a table drinking
and two others were at the bar, talking to
Toolter and an assistant.

“Hallo!” Nick heard Tooker say to the
Frenchman, and then the two at once walked
to some room in the rear.

The assistant came forward to attend to
the newcomer, and the great detective was

' After this, Pierre said he was dry, and the

Nick had listened to the talk with deep
interest. _

From the store-room the detective slipped
out into the yard and hurried around to
Tooker’s private stable.

Theedoor was fastened with a common
padlock, and this was quickly picked.

Nick lit his lantern and inspected the

It was apparent that the man was drugged.

He did not 4 belong to the crowd, and now
this other fellow was about to clean him out,
with half of the booty to go to Tooker.

“Look here, my friend, I'm mighty funny
in my head," hiccoughed Aspen, presently.

“Oh, that's a bit of booze, that's all.
You’1l sleep it off by morning." _

“I never felt so before. I believe that
darn beer made me sick."

“You'll soon be home."

' ‘Yes,give me a chance—I’m sicl: all over

Aspen said no more.

He fell upagainst Meggs and his eyes
closed. ‘

The drug or “knock~out drops,” as it is
called, had done its work, for he was uncon-
scious and would be for several hours. When
he came to it would be next to ixnpomible

Garot turned into the lane and tied his
horse behind a clump of trees.

' Then he leaped over the hedge and
sneaked across the garden to the mansion.

He walked all around the place, to satisfy
himself that all of the inmates had retired.

and occasionally the light would ﬂash under
the crack of the door.

Presently the Frenchman walked into the
music-room. Then Nick entered the apart-
ment he had left and kept him in plain sight.

As has been said,the music-room’ was well
stocked with rare violins and other musical
instruments, which hung in glass cabinets
on the walls. a,

At one end of the rather bare room stood-«

a magniﬁcent upright piano, and at the
other a large house organ. l

Garot paused to listen, and then appar-
entlysatisﬁed that he was unobserved, ap-
proached the organ.

‘He set down his lantern and began to
exainine the woodwork which enclosed the
bellows of the instrument.

It was not long before lreshoved in a

cealed hinges.

He ﬂashed the lantern light into the open-

ing ‘beyond and brought forth a small ﬂat

box of a handsome, inlaid pattern.

Placing the box in his pocket, he closed
the panel of the organ and then arose once
more to his feet.

"Now I will see who holds the winning
“hand,” he muttered to himself. ‘

Again he listened. Nick, behind a large ‘
rmnsic rack, made not the faintest sound.

Evidently Garot had now accomplished
the purpose which had brought him to the
mansion,-abut he'was not satisged, .

He looked around at the costly instru-
ments. and he paused in front of a beautiful
Creznona violin which had cost V0scar_,Brown-
lie an even twelve hundred dollars.

 The instrument was worth the money,

Again he paused, then moved' into the
library beyond. '

Here a small safe was built in the wall.
 But the door was closed, and after trying
i in vain to work the combination, Garot gave
it up with a shake of his head.

Leaving the safe, the Frenchman passed
into the hallway. ,

Suddenly a curse, was heard, then the
light wentout andall pecame dang .

Leaving O’Toole to do as be pleased, Nick
made his way to the second horse and started
for the road-house by a different route.

He went along leisurely, and it was
nearly an hour later before he drew up at
the end of the high board fence, and made
his way quietly to the stable.

As he had surmised, the other horse was
in his stall, and when he returned to the
house, he foun’d'the window still unfastened
as he had left it. The door was locked
from the inside, proving that Garot had
entered and gone up-stairs.

A minute later found Nick in Meggs’ '

room. He listened and heard the French-
man removing his clothing, preparatory to
retiring for the balance of the night.

“He’s a cool customer, after all," said
Nick to himself.

“He thinks he has the box safe, and I

The first thing which interested Nick

were several notes given by Babette Le Rue

There was a crash, and over went the
piece of furn_iture,°carrying the lamp with it.

Luckily, the light went out, otherwise the
apartment would have been set on ﬁre. ‘

In the darkness, Nick felt somebody seize
him from behind.

With a quick movement he backed his
man against the wall.

The crash broke the plaster, and it also
caved in two of the fellow’s ribs.

A groan and an oath escaped him.

The voice was 'I‘ooker's, and swinging
by the throat. ’ H

“Have you had enough?” he demanded.
“You have broken every rib in my body!" ‘
groaned Tooker. ‘ ‘Help me, Garot!"'

There was no reply to this appeal.

Garot had taken time by the forelock and i
skipped out. ,‘ E 3

The murderer. felt that Nick was after

him and notafter Tooker.

‘Tooker owned the place,and could notvget

was not likely, and he had certainly been

ANOTHER NEW IDEA

The Shield Weekly

TRUE DETECTIVE STORIES

Are stranger than fiction. THE SHIELD WEEKLY is a new series ot Detective Stories, but it is
“ something different." Street & Smith’s long experience in the publishing business has taught
them that the average man and boy like nothing better than good detective stories. We have, in
the past, published many ofthe old style, where the detective passes through a series of marvelous
and hairbreadth escapes and finally secures his qtr;rr‘r‘y. THE SHIELD WEEKLY will, however, be an
absolute/ﬁr new depart:/re. Each and every number of the weekly will contain a history of a
complete and intricate crime, the solution ot which is \vor‘ked out by the skill and ability.ot' the

detectives.
THESE ARE TRUE STORIES
absolute chapters of experience taken
from the note books of the greatest
and most noted Chiefs of Police in
the largest cities of Americausatawt

Their fund of knowledge upon this subject has been drawn upon by special arrangerneut. We
propose to demonstrate to the reading public of Arnerica through the SHIELD WEEKLY that the trw
histories of rum’ crimes cou!.1r'u as much and more of ronz.1-rice than do the inmginative tales
winch have been zonstructed in Hz.’ past lgr !I1uu'r'z‘tu's of dclcc/iw storizs. We feel that the
time is ripe for the presentation of this absolutely new class of detective tales. The first numbers
in this series will consist of manuscripts from records in the archives of the Boston police, as repre-
sented by INSPECTOR WATTS, who is well known throughout the New England States, in
fact, throughout America, as one of the sllrzwdest and most c/mm‘ Secret Scnu'cc Ojjicidls in the
world. The great inspectors of other large cities of the country will figure in due course.
