As Clif ascended the steps with a basketful of treasure. Jack heard smothered sounds coming
from the old ruins. Suddenly from around the stone wall three strangely attired
natives sprang out on the mound and menaced Jack with their spears.

V .i,"T;here was a rush ;of footsteps’ and through
the gloom shotthe portly ﬁgure of Constable

move, for he. was taken entirely by surprise,
- the officer had ‘him by the arm, with~a grip

3 To be sent to the county workhouse was con’-
sidered’ a terrible disgrace for 'a'boy, and the
very idea of such a fate being in prospect for
him, made Jack desperate. He made a sudden

“It won't do, young fellow. You can’t, get’-
away from me,” he said,'with an accent onlthev .
last word, as‘ if» to remind his prisoner of the
absolute futility of trying to give him the slip";-

“Oh, Lord,” groaned Mr. Glidding, “my poo
back.” I believe ‘he meant to do me serious in-
Jury! "ll. '

Jack might have explained that the mixupwas
a pure accident, but he felt in no humor for
holding any conversation with his uncle, -whom "
he never’ disliked more in his lifejthan he did at
‘that moment. . ,_ .
.. “I'll see»that'he doesn't get away from me’.

and provided with stout iron—bound doors and
barred windows, was built -of stone, while the
half story was a mere wooden attic that had,
never been used for anything in particular.

On reaching this substantial but gloomy look{
ing edifice, which was regarded with awe by the”
small boys’ of the village, Jack was unceremoni
_01}sly locked _up\ in the cell nearest the ofﬁc ,
and left to meditate on the uncertainties of lif,,,

CHAPTER II.—Bi1l the Butcher.‘

' The constable had hardly departed than 'J'a/?:’k,
who had seated'himsel'f on a rude cot 'placed
against the brick wall and given himself up to’
gloomy reﬂections concerning his immediate
future, was aroused by‘ a thumpingﬁon the wa
...behind him. » V a ' = ’ 
‘There was a certain indication that the other,
cell had,an occupant, too, and the boy wondered
who hiscompanion in misfortune was. It_ was
apparent that the otherprisoner «was trying to
attract the attention of the latest arrival,“ Th
thumping continued for some moments, with.‘short
intervals of silence._ -, g
‘-‘Who's there?” cried Jack at last. . - I! :'~ _
“Bill the Butcher/’,came_ back the feply in‘
hoarse smothered tones. , ‘ ’ ‘    ,,
There were two butcl§rs in the village,~lan‘t
neither they nor their ssistants wereqiamed,
Bill. Besides, these same butchers, as as
their helpers, were law-‘abiding personswho were
not likely to make the acquaintance of a-;_c_é1l_
in the lockup, therefore, Jack was at fa loss " '

' ; manner.
 " i “What d’ye s"bose I want, you lubber?  want
‘ to get out, don’t ye?” growled the other, in fog-
N porn tones.
  There is no doubt that Jack would have liked
 to have got out,’but with the cell door padlocked,
and the outer roor also well secufed, he thought
 : there Wasn't much chance of either of them get-
 , ting out until Constable Squeers let them out.
. 1;Y’e,s,h I’d like tcé get out, but that isn’t pos-

 “B_utche_r?” asked Jack, feeling some interest in
hl§‘1:“<:i:-gr1ih)t?lfin’ except splicin’ my mainbrace.”
It was evident that Jack’s neighbor was a
sailor, and “splicing the mainbrace” was, in
 nautical phraseology, taking one or more drinks.
 Jack, not being up in sea lore, did not com-

‘As he remained silent, Bill the Butcher continued

- The reader may wonder how this conversation
could be.carried on through a brick wall, but it
happened that Bill the Butcher had discovered
.3. weakness in the wall and removed a number
of bricks from it, so that when the constable
left the building,only one layer of brick at that
‘j particular spot stood between the two prisoners.

“Say,_ Mister Bill, what good will it do you
to get in here? There isn’t any way of escap-
ing from this cell.” i

“We’ll make a way, sonny,” was the reply, as
a third brick fell dut of the hole. "

“I don’t see how.”

‘Then stow yer jaw and wait till yer see what
happens.”

After a half a dozen bricks had fallen on the « ' '

bed Bill’ the Butcher began widening the hole
on_ his side, as Jack could tell by the fall of the
bricks on the cemented ﬂoor. After awhile more
bricks fell on the bed and the opening grew
rapidly wider. Bill the Butcher appeared to be
hustling for all he was worth, and his strength’
seemed to be prodigious. _

“Say, sonny, how does the ceilin’ look on yer-
side?” ,

“Can’t see it. It’s too dar .” 1 

“Couldn’t yer put yer chair on the bed and ,
stand on it?" That would bring yer close to R.
Then if yer had a match in yer clothes—--” . .

“.I’ll take a look at it, though I don't see what .
good it will do.”

“_Wait a minute, sonny, till I pass yer in’ a-

ought to be able to pound ahole in it sameas
Pm doin’ in this here wall. When ye’ve knocked ’
a yard .of plaster down yer kin smash in a few ,
of the laths and see what’s on the other side.”

“There are beams. and ﬂooring on the other
side, of course,” replied Jack, who thought that
to follow the man’s directions was a useless _
waste of eﬁort. .,

“I reckon the ﬁoorin’ ain’t none to strong’, my
hearty, and if the beams is wide enough I’ll get
through ’em. I’ve done that trick afore now.” 

“How are you going to push up the ﬂooring,
supposing you’re able to reach‘ it?" gr

“Don’t you worry about that, sonny. If I kfn

A‘big patch in the corner was discolored as

though moisture had penetratediit at that pohit. =11 ’

Jack moved the chairover a bit, got up again

and pounded the plaster with the end of the " 
chair leg which the man had passed in to him.‘ 1,.
It did not seem to be solid, but rather loose ‘~

from the laths. - '

miﬁit he heard a scrambling sound in the next
ce .

Looking down he saw the head and stalwart.’ 
shoulders‘ of the other prisoner coming through . f 

the opening in the wall. A moment later Butcher.
Bill, as he called himself, landed in Jack’s cell.
“Flash 21 glim up there and let’s see what’

you've done,” said the man, in his fo horn voice, 7‘ ‘

Jack struck a match, and whi e Bill the;
Butcher looked up, the boy looked down, curious
to found out what kind of a chap his companion’

was. It was a rascally, bewhiskered countenance’ . i

that Jack saw beneath him. _‘ V x '
A face that an artist would have considered an.
excellent model for ‘an old-time sea. rover of

J oodshot, his skin the color of -mahogany, _and

Jack wished him back i his own -cell, with
‘lhe brick wall in its original condition, for as a
cellfmatelhe was decidedly undesirable. .
.. “Y,'ou’v'e done retty well considerin’,” growled
gihe ‘unsavory loo ing mariner. “Come down now
A-and I'll get up and see what I kin do.”
Jack got down in a hurry and stood back
'_ nvhil-e Billthe Butcher, who looked more like a
‘ fhutcher of human beings than of dumb animals,
‘mounted the chair which hardly looked strong
-enough to support him. _
~ . ,_ “Hand me a match, sonny,” he said, holding
down his hairy hand that greatly’ resembled the
';IP3-W of a . gorilla.
 Jack gave him two. He struck one, looked at
dlhe lathing, and then proceeded to demolish it.
 Ilt yielded under his ‘efforts like so much pie
‘ trust‘;
5 ,,In.a, few minutes ‘he had it all cleared away
Ibund‘ the hole which he enlarged to nearly a
square yard. Then he pushed his arm up be-
, ‘tween the wide beams and felt of the ﬂooring
infthe attic. , . :-
“Just as .I thought, sonny; it ain’t much better
than unk,” he said.‘ _
I "Using the-chair leg as a battering~ram, he
 mashed one of the thin boards almost at a
 single blow. Once he had made an opening in
to "him. 7 '
—. In a quarter .of anthour he had smashed and
 ripped out a passage large enough for ‘him to
~ force his way with some-difficulty’ through. As
soon alsl he was in the attic he'looked down into

Bill.‘ “There’s a winder. All we've’ got to do
is to raise it and drop out._" _ _

CHAPTER IV.——Jack Reaches Rockport.

It was seven in the morning when Jack en-
tered_Rockport. He was dead tired after his
long walk, and the dearest wish of his heart
at thatimoment was to ﬁnd some retired spot
where he could lie down and go to sleep. Still,
he knew he was taking chances of arrest if he
remained many hours in Rockport: '

Yet what could he do? He was in no shape
to continue his ﬂight further on foot, and he
didn’t have even the price of a railroad ticket
to the next station. Nor did he have money
enough to pay for the most frugal kind of a
breakfast. He began to- realize that his case
was a pretty desperate one. .

He walked mechanically through the streets,
heedless of the direction his feet were taking
him, until at last he found himself on the water
front. Before. him stretched a vista of wharves
with numerous craft, mostly fore-and-after
coasters, lying alongside of them. The work of
loading and unloading many of these vessels was

‘X just beginning for the day.

Empty teams and others ﬁlled with goods were
beginning to ‘arrive from different directions.
The scene presented before the boy’s eyes was
one of life and action, and under different con-

»' ditions it would have greatly interested the young

runaway from Wakeﬁeld village. _
Jack leaned against the wall of a ship

chandlery shop which faced the wharves and

blinked at the busy men‘ on the docks, the

vessels and the sunlit waters of the harbor. Sud.-.,Z

tlenly his attention was attracted to the queer
actions of a smooth—faced chap of perhaps twenty,
window of

merit. ,
“I wonder what he's up to?” thought Jack,
watching the young man. ‘ .
Presently the object of his attention dexter-
ously shoved his arm through the opening and
then withdrawing it quickly with a long black
wallet in his hand, started on the run across
The head and shoulders of a portly

In an instant Jack realized what had happened,

- , and on the spur of the moment he darted after
the thief, intent on capturing him and return-

ing the’wallet to the owner. Jack forgot all

had voluntarily entered on.

heels before the fellow became aware that the

“Yes you did, for I saw you do it.” ' *'~
“You’re a liar," snarled the other. ~ V _.
“Am I? I,_ see the end of it sticking “out, of

Jack pounced suddenly on him and pulled the
I_on§,g>lack wallet out of the side pocket of his

“There, what do you call that?” cried the
boy, triumphantly.

_‘‘Blame you, give that back to me. It's
mine.” ’

“Not much. I’ni going to return it to the
owner.” V -

“Hold on,” cried the thief, as Jack‘ turned 
away, “don’t be a fool. We’1l open the wallet
and whack up even.” - "

This suggestion didn’t take with Jack, who
was a thoroughly honest boy. _ ,1

“No, we won’t do anything of the kind. What 
do you take me for?” he said, indignantly;

Seeing that the bait had failed to’ catch Jack,-. 
the rascal, with a snort of rage, sprang upon
the boy and tried to wrest the wallet from him..\—

They struggled along the stringer of the ". '
wharf, each trying to regain possession of the "
pocketpook. For some moments the advantage
rested with neither, for both were about the
same height, and both equally strong and active.

Then the thief tripped over a‘ wodden fender .
that lay on the wharf. Jack instantly availed ‘:
himself of the chance to snatch the wallet from 2
the 1-ascal’s gras . As the fellow fell backward,
struck on the stringer and rolled overboard, Jack,
without noticing his mishap, started back up the
dock on the run, fully expecting the thief to*
tag after him for part of the way at least. 

I When the young runaway ﬁnally glanced’ '7-..~,
back over his shoulder he saw no sign of‘ tho‘-‘”".,
rascal, and concluded he had given up the con- ' ‘
test as a bad job. Jack made his wa J across * Y
thestreet and walked into the ship c andlery 
shop. Here he found the portly proprietor _
standing at the‘ door of his small counting-room’ 
talking excitedly to 'a policeman. 

_‘‘Excuse me, sir, I think this belongs to you, '
said Jack holding up the stolen wallet.  .

"Ha, where did you get it?” cried the man; 
snatching it from his hand. . _ _  

“I chased the thief out on the wharf and took
it away from him." I '

“You did, eh‘! You were the boy I saw run
after him, and I thought you were his accomplice.‘
Are you sure the rascal didn’t take the money
out of the book?” _ i , Q s W

“I didn’t see open the wallet. ' I didn’t —
give him much time to do it. At any rate, he ' :
put tip a fight when I cornered him,‘ and even r
oﬁei-e to divide the contents of the pocketbook.

against him." .

“The money is here,” said the portlyvmang.
in a9t,one of relief. “What is your name, young»:
man. 1 ,- , ._§_ _

~, He handed »-the money to ack, who accepted
fit mechanically, thanked him and then walked
.-.-“out, of the store, leaving the ship chandler to
close the incident with the policeman. .
 “Ten dollars!” muttered Jack, gazing at the
' ' bill, “Now I can eat and then-take. a train to

" His satisfaction was great, and the anticipa-
tion~of getting out of his present difficulties made
 him \feel like a new boy.

‘After going a block he came to an alley. Glanc-
‘ing up it he saw a sign extending out above a
,5 door which read as follows: “Mariners Rest.
I V Lodgings, 25- Cents. Meals at all hours.”
 “Meals at all hours,” said Jack to himself.
,;“I guess that’s a restaurant.”

As he didn't notice any other restaurant sign
_,~__» in the neighborhood, and feeling uncommonly
ﬁdiungry, he entered the alley and walked up to
i ‘the door. A man in shirt sleeves, with a
 Hibernian cast of countenance and a pipe in his
mouth, came to the door just as Jack arrived
‘xfabreast of it. After eying the joy from head
-’_to foot with a curious stare, he said: .

.the place went back to the_ kitchen. The run-
‘awaypgazed with some curiosity upon his sur-
I _ undings. The room was long and low, with.
exposed rafters in the old-fashioned style. A

In a few minutes the boy looked up and caught _
Jack staring at him. ‘He returnedtlie look’ and 
seemed to be sizing the runaway up. At that, .-
moment the proprietor entered the room with’
Jack’s breakfast. He laid the plates containing. I '_
a piece of steak, some fried potatoes, bread and ‘Li
butter on the table and inquired: ~ 7

“Will’yez have tay", coffee or beer?”

‘Coffee,” replied Jack. ‘ ~ ,

The coffee was brought and the runaway’ be-
gan his breakfast. The youth at the opposite: "
table watched him intently. Although he had ‘-
finished his own breakfast he seemed in no hurry -:5:
to leave the place. —Jack looked up once ‘or twice
and caught the lad looking at him. ’ ' ,  )

‘I wonder who, he is?” he thought, and this
was the same question the other boy’ had asked
himself some moments before. , c 

Jack didn’t~lose much time over his meal, for:
he was hungry, and he soon cleaned up the V
plates. As he sat back with a sigh of satisfac-
tion, the proprietor approached the other boy
and said to him: ' '1

blow with all his brutal strength when Jack,
who had watched the scene with a feeling of
great sympathy for the moneyless youth, sprang
on his feet and cried out in ringing tones:

“Hold!” »

' The proprietor turned his head to see who had
the assurance to interfere‘ in the matter, while
the _two remaining customers in the room re-

arded Jack with an unfavorable stare. The
Irishman’s brow grew dark and stormy when he

j saw’ that the butter-in was the other boy, his

last customer.
“What's the matter wit’ ye, ye young spa]-
pegn?” ’he roared. ' _ _ _

,“How much do I owe you?”

“That will be ﬁfty—ﬁve altogether Take it

“Where did _the loikes. of ye get so much

as if he feared it might be_a spurious_one.

“That’s none of your business,” replied Jack,

“Where have yez been, Bill, since ye washere
last?” said the proprietor, setting a small glass of
gin before the sailor who had pulled a chair up
at the end of the table occupied by Jack and Ar-
lington. . _
_ “Dont’ ye be to inquisitive, Barney Fagan,” re-
plied the sailor with a solemn wink of his eye.
“Jest ye fetch me somethin’ to eat, and charge

everythin’ to this chap. - He's ﬂush, he says, so*I

reckon he kin stand for it.” _ *

“Stand it! Faith he kin. I changed a tin—dol-
lar bill for him a few minutes ago, and he’ got
most of it in his pocket this minute.”

Fagan having imparted this bit of information,‘

to the sailor, started for the kitchen.
“Here’s forty-ﬁve cents for you, Mister Bill,’7
said Jack, laying the change on the table “That"ll

pay for you breakfast and a couple of drinks. I

“Goin’ for a walk, eh? Ye only think yer are.

- “Oh, I dont’ know. I'm willing to risk it.”
“But I ain't, sonny, so sit down,” and the

brawny sailor grabbed Jack by the arm and forced .

him back into his chair. ~

There was a look in the sailor's eye that cowed
Jack for the moment, and he did not resent Bill
the Butcher's rough action. He looked at Ar-
lington, and Arlington looked at lﬁm, but neither

said anything. The mariner, having ﬁnished his .

understand that the sailor had been in trouble and

heaclhgot out of it in a measure, by the skin of his

“So yez want me to get yer a lift to Boston on a ,

on the back.

“I dunno as there’s any objection if Fagan kin
manage it.” ’

The Irishman said nothing. He seemed to be ‘

considering the question; or was it something else

he was thinking about—something that accounted ’ I

for the wicked look that came over his face for a

_captain’s use, and ‘the sailor on watch was ex-
pected .to see.that no one else used it, either to
come aboard or leave the bark. The captain, not
having come aboard yet, Big Bill had an idea that
, he intended to remain on shore all night at the
u . consignee’s house.‘ It happened, howeveruthat
’ 2 as Bill struck the sixbells forward the skipper
was coming toward the vessel. He r_eached_the
bark, and started to ascend the rope ladder J11§li
as Jack sprang on the bulwark. The boy in his
 ' hurry to reach the quay, did not notice that the
. , I sltiiper was below him and slid down the ladder
"» . wit a rush that made‘ a collision between them

_ ‘unavoidable. _
The shock of the contact caused the captain to
' lose his hold on the ladder and he_ tumbled back on
the quay, narrowly missing goingthrough the
space between the vessel and the dock. Jack fell
on top of him and then rolled_ a yard away. The
“skipper, who was somewhat intoxicated, uttered
a loud roar and a volley of imprecations as he
struggled to pick himself up. Clif, following Jack
without delay, bumped into the captain as he was
j‘ , getting up and sent him down again. The unex-
pected racket brought Bill to the bulwark in a
hurry. It also brought the.chief mate out on deck

in light apparel. — ’
“What’s all this rumpus about?” asked the
mate, sharply. _ I ' .

 B.§‘1That’s what I’m tryin’ to ﬁnd out,” replied
: 1 , ‘
“Ahoy! Aboard the bark!’_’ roared the captain.
“It's Captain Strong,” e,]aculate(l* ‘the mate.
“Get on to the quay and seeiwhat the trouble is.”
 He sprang to the bulwark himself and the‘ mo-
‘  ymenthe looked over the side, he saw the forms
of the two boys hurrying away with the ca tam
, in'full chase after them and making night ide-
- one with his imprecations and calls for them to

’ “lIt’s those two young lubbers trying to give us

. . . Jackaand Cliff were badly rattled by their unex-

i )- * ‘pected énccunter with the captain of the ship, and
‘ * after pausing invan undecided manner close to the

bark, turned and hurried off across the quay with ‘

the skipped in pursuit. Captain Strong was not
“; so muc under the inﬂu cc of liquor but he was
«, gfully alive to the situation after he had recovered
 A his ﬂeet. He could run some when his anger was
, , up, and the boys soon found that they would have
i: .. to» ut on steam to elude him. The fact that the
E; nig t was luminous with stars made it more diffi-
7*- . ‘ cult for the runaways to shake off the skipper off.

vented Bill from joining ‘us. The town will be 
searched for us by the authorities, I suppose, so 2
we gan’t stay here and hope to avoid ca ture. The,
only safe thing for us to do will be to eep right;
on into the outskirts. In fact, the further we get
away the better.” , , ‘ . 

“Lima is _only six miles away,” replied Clif.=»
“I move we go on there. We can walk the ties of V
the railroad. It roughtn’t to take us more than a 
couple of hours to get there.” ’ 

“All right. Ifm willing; though whether we'll 1
be any safer there than here is a question. You ‘
see, being foreigners and sailors to boot, we are '
bound to attract notice, and our presence in the
city might be reported back here. In that case, ',
we’d stand a good chance of being nabbed." . . 3

“Well, we’ve got to make the best of a bad"
situation.” , '

The boys kept on their way till they came in,
sight of the railway. Then they took to the road- ‘ j
way with ‘their faces in the direction of Lima. A
smart walk of two hourtbrought them in sight of 2
the capital of the country. It was two o'clock’ -

of everything but the straw in which the barrels
of wine had rested during their transit to Lima.

fprtable that their repose became even, deeper. At
any rate, they did not wake up to the fact that
they were getting a free ride into the country
~—. behind Lima and up into the mountain range. The
.v driver lost no time along his route, for he was
anxious to get back to his destination, and when-
-_‘ever his nag showed signs of easing up ‘his brisk
pace, he whipped him up and made him under-
stand that there was no rest for him till he got

lad and hissed out a sentence in S anish.

, Its import Was wasted on Cli , for the boy
didn’t know a word of the language.

“Why don’t you talk United States?” replied
Clif. I .
“Ha! You are Americano?” he gritted.

“Bet your life I’m an American. Why in thun— '

der were you trying to knife that old man, you

I cowardly rufﬁan?”

“Bah! ‘I ﬁx you, Senior Gringo,” he cried, tum-

‘ ing to Jack, and making a snatch at the handle of

his knife.

“Not much, you rascal,” cried Jack, stepping
back, for encumbered by the dead weight of the
girl he felt he was at a disadvantage.

The old gentleman, with a look of gratitude on
his face hastened to relieve him 0 his lovely
burden. ‘ 1 _

“Se 10 agradezco a usted, senor,” he said in
Spanish, meaning “I thank you, sir.” _

Jack didn’t understand him, nor did he pay
much attention to him, as he had the wicked
rascal to head off. '

That individual seemed to be debating whether
to attack the young sailor or not. _

Had Jack been alone‘. he probably would not
have hesitated an instant, but Clif showed such a.
bold front, too, that the ruﬂian had some doubts

_ as to the result of a belligerent act on his art.

He glared at Jack and Clif alternate y, and

‘ then, ‘hissing out something in Spanish at the old

entleman, he abruptly left the room and the
ouse, and the boys saw him striding off down
the carriageway toward the mountain road.

V’ CHAPTER XI.——Senorita Estella ‘Cervantes.

With the departiire of the gory-minded indi-
vidual matters quieted down in the room, and a
couple of maids, who had evidently been too terri-

' fled to answer the young senorita’s calls for help,

now appeared, and at the command of the old
gentleman, who appeared to be her father, took
charge of the unconscious girl and carried her out
of the room between them. '

The old man now turned to the boys.

Walking up to Jack, he held out his hand and
addressed something to him in Spanish.

Jack took his hand, but shook his head and said
he didn’t understand a word he said.

“Ah, un Americana!" replied the old gentleman
with a smile. “You do not understand_Spanish?”

“I understand and speak the English a little,”

I i, said the old gentleman, with another smile. “My

“No, senor, we have eaten nothing since about ,3

You shall be served with a li ht repast at once,"'f

That was quite satisfactory to Jack and Olif, 7%
and they heartily thanked the senor. ' ~ ,5
“No.«thanks senor; the obligation is all on my

I-Ie opened a roomy closet and showed them
several suits of clothes, cut in the fashion of the
country, which belonged, he said, to his son, who

“She’s the ﬁnest looking girl I thiiik.I'evez.

at They each selected the suit that_m9st struck
eir fancy and arrayed themselves in it.
To their great satisfaction, the_* clothes ﬁtted
them as if they had been cut to their measure. ‘

‘ “I guess we must be the same general build,

Clif,” said Jack. “All these suits Were made fol‘

the Don’s son, and since they ﬁt us as well as they

H probably ﬁtted him, the three of us have about the
game ﬁgure. That's fortunate, as far as_ we are
concerned. We look a whole lot better in these
' clothes than in our rough sea togs. I_‘Iow after
we've had a wash, and spruced up a, bit, I guess
we needn't be ashamed .of our personal appear-

improved appearance with an approving eye. _
“My daughter is now quite recovered and is

most fetching gown, was the daughter of the
house—Senorita Estella. » v

She greeted them with a. smile of welcome, but _ ,
her gaze rested particularly on J ack’s manly, sun-
browned face.

She recognized him as the one who had snatched
the knife from the hand of Pedro Gonzalez at
the critical moment when her strength was slip-
ping away from her and her father’s life hung on ’
a thread. ‘ I 

She made a place for him on the seat beside' "
her, and the boy took it with alacrity, while Clif
had to content himself with a rustic chair op-
posite.

Her father, when introducing the boys, stated _
that they were Americans and did not understand 
Spanish. A ' ‘

“I guess we'll get along without any trouble," ’
she said in excellent English, ﬂashing one of her ’.
irresistible side-long glances at Jack. *

“Sure thing,” laughed Jack, and Clif echoed the
same sentiment. ’ V

“I suppose you are curious to learn the mean-*
ing of a scene which your presence alone pre-
vented from becoming a tragedy,” said the seno— ‘A
rite, glancing at Jack. r _'

“Oh, we don’t wish to pry into the matter if '5 _
there is any reason on your part forlkeeping it a V, ,
secret,” he replied.‘ * 

‘.‘There is no reason for concealment,” she said. 3"
“Ican tell you in a few words, and it is quite ~
proper you should be made acquainted with the {
particulars.” , . 

Tliereupon she told them that Pedro Gonzalez, 
who had been the overseer of the plantation for ' "
many years, had had the assurance to fall in love
with her immediately after her return from New .
Orleans, a month previous. He had pester-ed her. ~ “ ,
with his attentions-.and ﬁnally asked her to marry r 
him. She said she ad dismissed him with a curt
refusal, whereupon he sought her father and aslc- ‘
ed his permission to follow up his suit. '

“My fathenwas both surprised and displeased;
at the words of Gonzalez,” she went on, “and r
plainly told him that an alliance with me was 
quite impossible. He refused to_ accept that de-‘
cision as ﬁnal, and conducted himself in such a
way that my father was compelled to discharge
him from his service. He left the plantation vow-'
ing to be revenged. He sent my father several
letters telling him that unless he agreed to look T
with favor on his suit he would kill him. This i
morning he came here in person, and after a heat- ’
ed interview with my father, tried to carry his .
threats into effect I heard my father call for -.
help and rushed to his gssistance, but I could not“
have saved him alone. When I realized my hel -
lessness I screamed for aid, but it happened t 42
male servants wereout ofhearing at the time,':,
and so to you, Senor Jack, my father owes his —
life, and both of us are deeply grateful to you,”
she concluded, giving the young runaway a look
that made his heart beat several degrees quicker.

The two hours that intervened before dinner
was announced passed quickly to the boys in the
society of the charming senorita. When the fe-
male_ servant came to tell them that the meal was
waiting, Jack gs-llantly offered his arm tothe girl
and escorted her to the table, Clif accompanying

.,_Cl'HlAPTER XII.-—At the Site of the Treasure.

 Jack and Clif never had a better time in their
p life than they enjoyed during the week that fol-
' -slowed. They had both made themselves popular

‘ r with Don Luis, who liked the society of young peo-
ple. As for the senorita, it soon developed that
she had eyes only for Jack and Clif was not a lit-
 tle jealous of his friend in consequence. '
-’ "How can I help it?” protested Jack, when his
companion was making a kick about the matter.
  “You don’t "want to help it,” growled Clif.
~~ . - ,“‘You’re dead gone on her. Anybody can see that
" with a half an eye. It’s my opinion though, that
-,she’s just ﬂirting with you because you're an easy

mark.”

“Oh, I don’t know," retorted Jack, with a frown.

v. It hurt his self-esteem to be told that the Span-

 , ,ish beauty was merely playing with his’ feelings.
. ’ “I don’t suppose you do know. You're so
"xwrapped up in her that you »couldn’t feel an earth-

». _

“Oh, come off. Don’t get so funny.”
“Well, it’s a fact. She’s got you wound up
:" good and hard. First thing you. know you’ll be
asking her to marry you and then ”
“igmd then what?”
 “ he’ll 've
, to that nza ez." All _ pretty girls are alike,
:» whether they’re American, Spanish, French,
Dutch or any other nationality. They like to make
monkeys of the men ”
“Oh, I guess there are some exceptions.”
_‘ “Ha, ha, ha! I s’pose you think the senorlta is
one of the exceptions. Well, keep on thinking so.
i We can't stay here much longer or we’ll wear our
iwelcome out- If we remain another Week it will
be the limit. By that time the bark will have
;'-isailed from Callao, and it will be safe for us to
return. ' You’d better ease up on the young lady,
or when yo come to say good-by it will be a case
’ goiir heart behind you for the senorita

 
  
   

 

‘ ‘ Clif?s advice may have been good, but it didn’t
jibe well with Jack’s feelings. /He couldn’t deny
that he was much in love with Don Luis’ daugh-
ter. And he couldn’t deny, either, that it seemed
to“ be utter folly on his part. The senorita’s eyes
‘and coquetries had played havoc with him, and he
felt that it would break his heart to leave her
.when the time arrived, which it was bound to do
. oon. He realized that he was no ﬁtting match
for the girl, and that her_fa_ther would regard his
,-aspirationswith little favor. It is true, he had
made himself pretty solid with the old gentleman
‘by saving his life, but that fact didn’t warrant
~li‘lJIl asking for the hand of his daughter.
‘words made Jack feel so sore that he walked out

"f the hacienda and took his solitary way up the '
"mountain road, utterly indifferent as to whether

e ever came back or not. '
’:]It was just at dusk, and he had promised to go
walking with Estella, but he had no heart to keep
' He walked on slowly with
,_ islhead down and his brain a prey to a jumble of
eonﬂictin feelings. The night was still, but the
‘ ky, usua ly bright with stars, was overcast now,
nd consequently the landscape looked vague and
ncértain. After going a mile the road forked

-on straight ahead and wound down the mountain._
to a valley in the range. Instead of fO1].0Wing_i’tp'_
Jack mechanically turned oﬂ into the branch’
which led with an easy grade up into the moun
tain range. Half a mile from the fork it entered ‘
a gloomy ravine. T I 
There was nothing here to entice the boy to -
keep on, but he did so, for it was a matter of in-
diiference to him where he Went while in his pres-
ent mental state. The ravine widened out into a.
plateau and the road he was following continued
upward, gradually narrowing down to a mere
path. Finally the boy awoke from his reverie‘ and
began to wonder where he had got to. Hehad
paid no attention to’ his progress into the range,
but still the path back was straight behind him, '
and had he been even fairly familiar with his sur-
roundings, he would have experienced no trouble’
in retracing his steps. The darkness of the night
was against him robably as much as anything‘
else,- and after ma ing several fruitless attempts
to ﬁnd the path which he had wandered away-
from, he sat do‘wn‘on-a fallen 'log»to consider/the’: _
situation. At that moment he heard voices com-_. A-~.~,.v
ing toward him. Two men were approaching from g '
the same direction he had come. They Walked di- ~ W
rectly into the‘ wooded nook where he sat, and‘; "as
stopped about a yard away without becoming _
aware of his presence. ’ ’ , .
“Well, my hearty,” exclaimedthge familiar voice:
of Bill the Butcher, “if ye’ll agre to help me car- ‘
ry this here treasure I spoke about out of these)
'mount’ins and down to Callao, I’ll let ye in on an
even half of it. That's fair, ain’t it?” — " j
“Si, senor,” replied the other, in an eager tone.’
“I am your man. How much think you this treas-
ure of the Incas amounts to?” '
 “Blame me if I kin tell yer, senor';fbut I wa
told it amounted to a hull lot.” _ * ‘ ‘ ’ 
“Perhaps a hundred thousand pesos or more;
eh, Senor Bill?” . '  A
“A quarter of. a million more like,” repliédlthbi’
sailor, emphatically. '
“Say you so? That sounds good, senor,” replied’-
the man, with a sibilant laug . -
“I’ll bet it does.” - » _ . _ T,
“And this gold. It is hidden not far from here
senor?” said the Spaniard, with a greedy intona-,3
ion. - _  .-
“Not over a hundred miles,” chuckled the sailor. '
“A hundred miles! What you mean? Said you’
not it was in this mountain close by where we now‘
stand?” ’ I c 5 "' '

- Bill was silent for a moment, then, he saidr 
“Ye swear to do the right thing, senor? Ye will
not try to do me out of my fair half?" , .
“I swear by the saints,—senor, that I will-stake‘
no advantage-in‘ this matter. A half of a quarter.
of a million dollars,vor even one hundred’ thou:
sand, it is enough for me. c It is a fortune.“ . - 7 '
“All right. V I'll have to trust somebody, andye
are as good as anybody in these diggin’s. I real:
on a half of the treasure will make .yer for life: _
As the sailor spoke, he scratched a match .on_‘ ln_,_' ~..
pants to light his pipe. The blaze lit up the Sp’ :_ ’
for a moment and Jack recognized th'e Spani_ai‘gl-
as Pedro Gonzalez, as he turned his -hicjad si ’ ‘

 him’. Had it not been for the fact that Jack 1den-
' *  Bill’s companion as the_ rascallyx ex-overseer
. who’ had made the murderous attack on Don Luis
.-“Cervantes, it is probable he would have made him-
i V self known to the big sailor.
, ' ’ “Come on. I’ll take ye to the place now,” said
 Bill, as soon as he had coaxed the tobacco in the
bowl of his pipe into a glow. .
i Z..Jack listened eagerly to the conversationjust
* recbrded. It recalled to his mind the talk Bill

 

"the night they escaped from the Wakeﬁeld lockup,
and were on the road to Rockport. As We have
:‘ already remarked, he put no faith in the sailor’s
A »_ statement thathe knew the spot where a consid-
erable quantity of Peruvian gold was hidden in

‘ the mountains backof Lima. Now, however, in
3' light of the present incident, the matter looked al-
 . together different to him. Here was Bill on the
5 very ground making a deal with a Spani h resi-

 
 

 

ﬁw it, or at least the sai1or’s half, to Callao. Appar-
lentlv it wasn’t a forecastle yarn after all, but
— i something that had foundation, in fact. As soon
1 as Bill announced his willingess to show the hid-
ingplace of the treasure to Pedro Gonzalez that
 night, Jack determined to become an unseen par-
ticipant in the secret. V
vHa! So this is the place, Senor Bill, eh ?”. Jack
- heard the Spaniard say. “I have been here two,
‘A “three times, but never I suspected that treasure
was hidden somewhere about this old=Inca ruin.
I Now, senor, suppose you point out the exact spot
. .where we are to dig." ‘ _ o
, The sailor looked carefully around as if taking
r notes, making a complete circuit of the foot of
* themound. . _
As if certain he was on the right S1d_9 Of the
2 ruin, he walked directly to it, struck a match and
 began to examine the sun—dried bricks of which
i it was composed, and which had resisted the ac-
re‘) ‘$3011 of the weather during a ’matter of three
' ' ‘hundred and fifty years. . ,
, ‘ ,He had “to strike several matches before he

Buried . 
V . Treasure of the Incas. ' A
Before the boys turned in that night they held 
a long consultation about the treasure of the Incas
which, according to Bill the Butcher’s yarn, was .
buried somewhere in the mound on which the ».
ancient ruin rested up‘ in the range. ‘ 

It was ﬁnally decided between them that they. .4!
would investigate the mound on the following day.» i ‘

Accordingly, they broached the matter to Don C’
Luis at breakfast, and he said if they wished togo .
that morning he would place two of his employees if V
at their service- Jack accepted his offer 
thanks, and so the plans for the day were settled.-
Estella, as soon as she learned what was in the.
wind, insisted on accompanying Jack and the 
party, and’as herfather oﬁered no objection to‘

along on the treasure-hunting expedition. /-
An' hour from the _ti_me they left the hacienda

the previous night’s tra edy had occurred. The ”

out, but the boys were careful not to let their}
ciériosity entice them too close to the edge of thé  '
a yss. . r
The party rested under the shade of the woods};
close by for half an hour, and then proceededu‘
toward the ruins about half a mile distant. On.
their arrival at the mound Estella and the boys‘,
surveyed the curious ruins with a great deal of .
interest. It consisted of a tomb-like structure .‘
twelve feet square and erhaps twenty feet high’-'

v formed of thick slabs oPstone,'of a mathematical

length and height, sandwiched. in between layers
of coarse brick. _ ' 

V _A heavy stone coping of ornamented stone, ran
around the four sides close to the top. On the
side oppositethe spot where Bill the Butcher’ had
located the treasure, and which was indicatedrby

      

o

         

  

' the mound for his future guidance after he had
- ' got rid, of the sailor, was a thick slab of stone,
apparently marking the entrance to this odd struc-
" ure. It was so nicely ﬁtted,_.however, that it
wasn’t possible for Jack to insert the blade of his
knife at any point. .
“This door appears to have been sealed up_a
, long time ago,” he said, as the trio stood looking
at the stone. “It was done so well that you can't
» even see the slightest sign of the cement that was
V used to do it. The slab was made to ﬁt in so snug
‘ that it may not have needed. cement to hold it, for
it couldn’t be pried open without the bricks and
stone around it were knocked away.”
“If the treasure is .in that place how are we
' to t t 't?” k d Clif.
g0,Z‘I'l‘%ie trgegsdlrelisnﬁinethere if Bill the Butcher
knew ‘what he was about,” replied Jack.
"Where is it then?”
“In thevmound on the opposite side. At any
, rate, that is where Bill told Pedro Gonzalez that
: : at .19 i
"1 ‘ll-ll: did? ‘Then I bet he was fooling him.
.;. Doesn’t it stand to reason that if the Incas had
.' aitreasure they intended burying, they would put
it inside this building and not on the outside
where anybody could dig it up that happened to
_ hit on the right spot or took the trouble to go
oxler the ground till they found 1t?'” “ ’ _
Jack had to admit the force of his com-panion’s
' argument; and for the ﬁrst time began to suspect
that. Bi11’s location of the treasure was a pure

bhnd. ’

“Well,” he said, “if what Bill did last night was
« a bluff, and the ‘treasure, if one really exists,'is
., ‘inside of that structure, we are not likely to dis-

- cover it to-day with the im lements we have. It
i would take many hours wor with a pick to make

an entrance, and it would be pretty hard work _at

that. We haven't any right to ask Don Luis’

servants to do the work, and it looks to be too

"  strenuous a job for us. Therefore, before ﬁgur-

ing on attacking the Inca ruin, I_propose that we

dig at the point marked out by Bill, on the chance
that he was not bluﬁing.

“All right,” acquiesced Clif, “whatever yousay
goes with me. I'd much sooﬁner dig into the ground
than tackle the side of tha building with a pick."
1 v After their curiosity concerning the ancient
—_..ruin had been satisﬁed, Jack, Clif and Estella
walked around to the opposite side where the two
' servants were talking together under the shade

of the wood. Jack‘ pointed out the dead tree
branch that the Spaniard stuck into the mound
 and said that was where the treasure lay, accord-

ing to Bill.

- “If it’s there, all I’ve ot to say is that it’s a
‘mighty strange place to ury such a. thing when
w there is.a strong vault close at hand to receive

a it,” said Clif.

‘-‘Who knows but the whole of this mound was
once covered by a muchstronger building than
that ediﬁce yonder?” said Jack, after some
thought. I
buried in the time of Pizarro, 350 years ago,
there is nothing singular, in the fact that only a.
small structure now remains in fair preservation
to mark the site. This mound is probably com-
osed of the debris of the original building, a
; arge part of which has, no doubt, been blown or
washed away. In digging into the mound we may

the buried treasure. What they said, hdwever, ,
was not intelligible to the servants, as the men, .
did not understand English any better than Jack, 
and Clif knew the Sdpanish lan age. Finally the. .
boys resumed their igging an the two men were ,

‘‘That’s right,” replied Jack, in atone that be-

was likely to prove successful. " . .

Estella at this point said th ' ' ‘

up the gob and worked for an hour steadily, dur- «

worked on like beavers, greatly encom-ag-ed by,‘ ,
the progress that had so far been made. The sun '
was well down when Jack uncovered what was-

It seemed to be fast as wax, although there was
no lock or fastening on that side. Jack called for

His~pantomimic,motions, however, were expres4  ‘
sive enough to be understood.. It was clear-that  , —
he wanted Jack and his party to leave the neigh-»' V  ‘f
borhood at once. Jack had no intention of leaving. V 
, He and Clif had unearthed what _’ _,
they believed was the buried treasure of the Incas, I ‘ "
and Jack did not propose to lose his grip on such_
a valuable discovery. ’

. “What’s the matter with_ you?” was the boy’s 5
reply to the Peruvian. warrior’s demand.

_ The situation was certainly a strained one.
but Jack intended to hold his ground at,ai‘i_
hazards. By’ this time Clif had regained his ~ _

— ‘.‘We must chase these fellows, Jack,’.’ hesaid:
“If’ you disable the leader with a bullet, I'll ‘take

‘ Jack paid no attention to Clif’s suggestion, as
he was fully engaged in watching the manning,

would .do.next. _ The chap in question apparently
lost his patience at this moment, and he turned
to his companionsand spoke to them in ‘his «

minent, and Jack felt that they would have 
adopt Cl.if’s plan of operations to save~themselves, ~
though it seemed almost cowardly to shoot the‘
warriors down with their modern weapons1
against which the natives stood not the ghost"/of}
a s ow. - '

Even as these thoughts ﬂashed through Jac’k’s-_
mind the climax carne———but it came in a totally‘.
unexpectedand thrilling way. Just —‘as theqthi-ee."\
warriors were about to attack the two boys, the
ground began to tremble, then ‘rock to and fro,
and then seemingly to rise up like the billows
of an ocean, while the air suddenly became Sui‘
charged with athick, yellowish vapor. Jack, Cli .
and Estella were thrown violently to the earth, T‘
where they; remained. half stunned‘ and motionless. ‘

stairs leading downto the gold were untouched,
and his companions were unhurt; The moment
Estella recovered her senses she burst into a
fit of hysterical .weeping and threw her arms
around J ack’s neck. He encircled her waist with
one of his arms and tried his best to calm her.

“Gee! What struck us that time?” asked the
demoralized Clif.

“Why, can’t you guess? It was an earth-

I quake.” V '—

“Was it? So those are the things that Bill
said he was so ‘accustomed to that he didn't
mind them at all. Well, take my word for it,
I don’t want to feel another. If they happen
often in this neighborhood the sooner we make

V tracks for Callao the better and take passage
. for San Francisco.”

“See if the treasure is safe, Clif.”

“One basketful is all right, and here it is,”
said the boy, lifting it up and placing it on

‘ the mound. “I’lI take a squint into the room
below at the rest.”

He returned with the announcement that but
ﬁve of the basketfuls of the gold remained in
the room.

“The rest have gone down into a great hole that
I didn’t dare look into,” he said. “That means
that the earthquake has done us out of 3. mil-
lion more or less." ‘ " _

. “But it saved us from having an encounter
,with those natives.”

. “That's so. They must have been the guard-

‘ ians of the treasure and lived in that square ruin.
Now they're gone, the ruin is gone, and half
of the treasure has gone, too. As it's getting
dark, I think we'd better go, too. We can't

, car the gold with us, so we'll have to leave
it till tomorrow for Don Luis’ servants to carry
-tb, the hacienda.”

Before leaving Jack insisted that they! should
remove the rest of the treasure from t e room
:,to the woods, and this was done. After cover-
ing the gold wedges over with brush, the three

' hyoung people retraced their «steps down the

mountain to the main .road‘and thence to the
hacienda. .

. They found the _old gentleman on the point of
setting out after them, and their appearance
afforded him intense relief. The story that Jack

* i told astonished him not a little, for he had not
the slightest idea that the boys would ﬁnd any
treasure at all at the ruin. He congratulated

. them on their discovery, and promised to have

I‘ the gold brought to the house next morning.

This was done immediatety after breakfast.‘

l _The moment Don Luis saw the wedges of yellow

V‘ metal he declared positively that they were made
- of pure gold_. Later on when disposed_ of to
 the Peruvian government, throught the instru-

. mentality of Don Luis, the sum of $500,000 {T1

1 .‘_gold coin was paid for it. Jack presented Clif

' _ with one-third of this amount, gave Estella $100,-

000 for herself and kept.$300,000.

. _ The possession of so much money entirel al-

tered the standing and prospects of the two ys.

Will and Mr. Wade now had the engine-house

“Fire!

The ringing of the fire—al<arm bell was at all

times suﬂicient to call out half the population of
Fairdale.

People ﬁlled the streets as if by magic. The mo-
ment the bell sounded Will was upon his feet.

“I must go, Mr. Wade! We will talk this over

‘again. I must see you as soon again as possible."

“All right, my boy,” said the Westerner. “I
am going to the ﬁre with you.”

Into the engine-house rushed the boys of Mon-'

arch No. 4. In a remarkably short space of time
they had manned the ropes and were oﬁ’.

Will Norton and Jack Craven ran ahead with
their trumpets. The engine company/ exerted
every nerve to be ﬁi-st at the ﬁre.

And as usual they were. The ﬁre was in a tene-

ment block in the most crowded section of Fa.ir- 7

dale.

The ﬂames were raging in the lower story. In  ._
the upper windows were men and women and chil- V 

gren, fully a score in number, hemmed in by the

re.

Will’s blood grew chilly as he saw their danger-
ous predicament. He realized that there would
be an awful loss of life unless something was

master hand was admitted even by the chief. v

With quick, sharp orders Will brought up the
hook and ladder_truck. He ordered a long ladder
placed in the middle of the street. Another was
placed slantingly against it_ to support it. Then
one of the boys went up lightly and lashed ‘the
top rounds together.

across to the window-ledge of an upper story, " « ‘

Then began the work of rescue. * ‘A

The ‘children were carried over the ladder-
bridge ﬁrst, one after another, being passed from
the~arms of one ﬁreman to another. The women
were next. . .  *

Rapidly the work of rescue was carried on.

moved, the men followed.  ‘

ﬂoors of the tenement fell in. The rescue had
been: none too soon. ' «

- It was with difficulty that the ﬁre was kept
1.-om spreading. But ﬁnally the ﬁre companies

 ' were able to take their leave shortly after mid-V 

night. ’
, Will washed up at the engine-house and went
_ home. His mother had not retired, and was wait-
. ing for him. He did not tell her of his experi-
ence at the bridge with Clinton Dugdale and Hall,
I nor of the surprising facts he had learned from
Mr. Wade.
,. , But when Will went to bed he lay awake a long
" T time’, pondering the matter. It would have been
 his natural impulse to go to the police and, if
  possible, at once secure the arrest _of the incen-
'  diary, Dan Cliﬁord.
 ‘ But he could now see that Mr. Wade's plan was
‘a perhaps the wisest, and it might be better to
'-"wait. In fact, he could offer no other evidence
A . than his own word that the real incendiary was
_ ' Cliﬁord; and this, he reflected, would-‘be hardly
‘ suﬁlcient. .
1 The next morning Will arose and went down
to the engine-house. He felt somewhat jaded
after the hard work of the- night before.

“No,” replied Will, “I have not.” , _
- ‘ “Well, have you heard. the report ‘concerning
 him,” she asked. ’

"What do you mean?”
“Here is the afternoon paper,” said Mrs. Nor-

THE PERFECT ANKLE _

' There is no ankle in the world to beat the ankle
of the English girl, says A. J. Munnings, R. A.,
the portrait painter, who is in great demand as a,
judge at ankle shows which just now are the fad
here and there about the country. _ .

“The English woman has perfect ankles’-«
straight and true and as beautiful as any on

earth, including the American girl’s,” Mr. Mun-“

nings declared after a ban at Norwich.

“Ankle awards are terribly difficult,” says
the artist. “Judging from the back is best. Ankles
which appear perfect from the front are often
disappointing at the back. In some ankles which
are otherwise perfect the Achilles tendon does not
come down gracefully.”

Improvement in ankles is due to more dancing »/

and more sport and exercise generally, he believes.
“Ankles of today are a vast improvement on the
Victorian age———but it was very diﬁicult to get a
glimpse of ankles in the Victorian age.”

- “Only Two Tramps”‘

/“Ashes to ashes. and dust to dust!” V
The earth and gravel rattled on the cofﬁn as it
fell‘ from the minister's hands, mingling‘ there
_.with the tears of two boys who stood leaning over
, .the open grave. . '
y This scene occurred in the far-away city of
.-.1_ Richmond. and _it was into a house in that city
 that the two boys groped their way that night;
._/they were roughly clad, and everything about
_‘ them denoted poverty. as did also the two rooms,
 »- whichhad been their home and their mother's.
' ,_ As the poor woman lay there on the. bed, dying,
 she had called the boys to her side.
"' “I am dying, my darlings,” she brokenly said.
“I must leave you, but not forever—no'—-no; we
”- will meet again—there!” and she pointed up-
‘ . ward .with one thin. white ﬁnger. “Promise me
-  that. boys.”  ‘ \
“We promise,” was the broken reply.
 “I am satisﬁed, then.” she weakly said. “When

PENNY WORTH $800 A

A United States penny, worth $800, according
to coin collectors’ guides, has been on exhibition
in the window of a jewelry store in Carthage,
New York. .

The owner of the coin requested the jeweler not
to make known his name. It is said that-only
three of the pennies were coined because of the
controversial nature of the inscription. It was
passed down to the Carthage man from his great‘-
grandfather. — .
