“Let’s go up and have a look at the place,” said the 
detective; and he led the way to the «top floor of (then S’ "

It was not necessary that theyshould look very -'far_"y
-to discover how thevman had made goodlhis escape, 
for it was apparent at once. V n.  S  '  
A. large, round hole had been sawed _in the panel of i ~.
the solid oak door, and it was cut as cleanly as if the
man had been provided with the very _best.of tools. I i S ,
But the hole was there, the pieces that had been  ~_ 
out of the door were scattered about the robrn  the .
hallway outside, and the man was gone. is  ,  :
Located in the center of the house, there was 
window to the room. There "was a skylight for ventila-
tion, and this was protected by- heavy iron bars.‘ " The
sides of the room were padded and upholstered in
leather; there wasyahbedi, a" couch, two comfortable chairs].
and all the necessaries. for remaining there an indeﬁnite, A
time. The door, which was also padded, waszrmade off - »
heavy oak, and was. thought» to be- capable of ,wi'thstand-“.
ing almost any ‘attack that might be.made upon it. A   p
Just now the room looked as if a cyclone had str,ucl<-lit‘.
The leather upholstering had been cut and s'lashed'iinl

That was practically.all.[ . .. A . .. _.    .

appeared to beii‘ He was white; his features were set and
hard, and when Nick touched him he found that the ﬂesh
was as bold and hard as if he had_ been dead many hours.

Not only that, but as the detective attempted to lift

rnent that a perfectstate of catalepsy had intervened, and
that Conner’s ~body«was as rigid as it woud be if rigor.
. .m0rt2's had really become complete. 3

rs p ‘But Nick, knew, even if Conner were dead, which he
l could not believeéwhich he did not think of believing-
‘ that -there had not been sufﬁcient time for any such con-

dition to come about. i
 ‘For a moment Nick did not know what to do.

He bent forward and listened to hear the beating of

.1. '. “Run and ﬁnd me the nearest doctor and bring him
here; only be sure that he is not one of these Orientals ;”

and bidding the other man follow him, he led the way

.;ba’c‘l<.:.int‘o the room. M

. There, he pointed silently at Conner, and after the man

‘had stared in speechless surprise for a moment,he said:

I {i“This is what happened since I went out to ﬁnd a tele-

iihadclisappeared, and now, lying there in his place and .

' ’ ‘And Conner looked quite as dead as the other man had '

one of AConner’s (arms, he discovered to his added arnaze- ’

practises that I am at a loss to explain.” '

' . Nick.

 

“None at all.” , .

“Go and see if the two men are stationed at the rear, »
where they should be.” I ' J

The man went away, but he returned after a moment,
on the run, and with his faceas white as the sheet that
ha1f—covered Conner. ‘ A

 

“They are there,” he cried out, “but theyiare in the
same condition that Mr. Conner is in——that is, not exactly

in the same condition, for they are limp; but they are:

both asleep and I cannot awaken them,” , p .
“Can you lift them P’-’ asked the detective, who began
to understand that he had run upon a mystery which

‘was perhaps a part with the one he was trying to un-

ravel. “Can you lift them, one at a time?”

“Oh, yes.” _ » , ,

“Then bring them in here.x There is a couch in the  
back room and one in this. Bringthem in one by one, - V
where I can examine them. “I 'don’t wish to leave Conner if
unguarded another moment.’’ I ‘

As soon as the detective saw the two men who‘ ‘were .
brought in, he understood at once that 'it was a case ‘ '
of hypnotism, and, having ﬁxed them as comfortably’ . _
as possible, knowing that they should be left to awaken . 
in their own good time, he turned his.attention again’, "
to his friend. ‘ ’ " '

 

This was hypnotism, doubtless, with catalepsy thrown‘ 
in, a hypnotism-that might result in actual death unless,  *
the man were somehow saved ;'but Nick felt that the casef 
was beyond him, and that he could do nothing until th ~.
arrival of a doctor. I 4 ‘

Fortunately, the guard rettirned with one he had fotind,  
just at that moment, and Nick, in as few words ‘as .pos.—‘~. -E
sible, related all that had happened in that house. V

‘The doctor was a young man and evidently a Jew, but _
he was smart and bright, and ‘he knew his’ ~busiuess* 
thoroughly. 1 . _ ' p

“I have been more or less among these people for two by 
years, sir,” he said, while he bent over Conner, “and I V
have already seen enough of them to know that they are I
greatimystics. I know that they are adepts at certain “
practises, which I cannot describe by any otherword,
than occult, for the reason that I know» no otheriwoird ‘
which will convey to you lithe impression I wish to give.” ’

“I understand you,” re lied the detective. I  

“I don’t wish it to be understood that I believe in 
cultism, for I am not prepared to go as far as that; b_utI
do know that some of these people, and particularly the V 
man who lives in this house, indulge in most, mysterious it

CHAPTER VI.
. THE SECRET OF THEDISAPPEARANCE.

V “I wanted to ask you,” began the detective, “to tell
‘ . me what you thought ‘about that other man whom.I
found in that house when we first arrived there? About
the man whose place Conner was forced against his will

_ to take.” '-

_ “As you suppose, your question does/lead up to ex-
V I actly what I was contemplating telling you about. But
I I must tell you,‘ in the beginning, that what I will say
V will be difficult of belief—gof any'belief at all. It would
i ' be only natural to call it preposterous.” '
I “'_There are lots of preposterous‘ things in the world.”
' “Yes, sir.
» i,‘‘‘Yes ?”
V. \“I cannot answer it directly. I can only say this-much"
 to start with: I do not believe that the man you saw
_‘ was dead. He was in the same cataleptic state in which
 ‘ ‘your friend is lying now.” i I A
A I, “That is what I thought aboutbit.”

Now as to your question.”

 

  
  

 /“Mr. Carter, I came to this section of the city purpose-

 ly to study some of the mysteries about these people that

i, have interested me deeply. I appear among them as a

 _ poor man, and I live poorly and cheaply in order to carry
’ out that deception.”

 

"‘I understand. You are a student.”

 

  “Yes. I am, in fact, a very wealthy man. who has a ’
 passionfor scientiﬁc research. That explains my being
 here; _it will also explain much that I will have to say
” toVyou.” I I i

 

 “Exactly.” ,

  
   
   
   
  
    
  
 

“Immediately ‘after I left college, I traveled in Pales-
tine. Later, I went across the mountains into Beyrut

‘ Syria, directly west from the city of Damascus, I fell in
with A__a strange people‘ who practised a -certain kind of
) n1agic,_which is themost phenomenal of any with which
Irever came in contact. They have two words, in their,
own /language which expresses‘ it, but ‘which are hard
2 to,translate.”: A . y , I ‘

I [?‘Give me an idea of them, if you can.”

“The best deﬁnition I can give you is this: The two
dids, mean, in eﬁecﬁthe ‘fusion of souls into one master

of the term.” _ t . - 4*

“No? What is it ?” . ,

“Soul with them——that is,‘with this pafticular sectof ‘

whom I am speaking—-means ‘the element of being.’ i ;
They explain that every entity is made up of many ele-
ments of being-—in other words, of many souls. Do you _|

“Well, this sect to which I have calle_d1your attention
practises a strange ceremony. I have never seen it done,_

 

but it has been described. to me so that I know exactly 

how it is done—-if it is carried out ht all. It is so hard to *

believe, thatll still doubt" that it can be accomplished, as
you will doubt.” l,- V 1
“Go on, please.”
“This ceremony is called ‘The Change.’ That is uni 1'
ekact translation of the word they use, but the change b
means much more than-you would suppose. Their belief -it i

 

is that a man whoTsubn1its himself to ‘The Change,’ and A A
does it willingly, may, through the ministrations, of one I ‘ 
of the followers who ‘is skilled in the art, assume any. .3‘-
