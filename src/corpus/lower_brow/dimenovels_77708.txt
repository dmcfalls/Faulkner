.THE CRIME Ar HOTEL ‘CALIGULA. , J

    

it Roger Sturtevant’s valet paused—outside'the*door, tray

in hand, and rapped’.

Then, without pausing for a reply, because his rap
nient._of his return, he opened it and passed through, clo-
sing it behind him. . g’

The ‘tray he carried contained toast, andeggs, and cof-
ice’ for his master’s breakfast, which§he had gone down-
‘airs to prepare, rather than to leave it to the regular
"fteyl,-servants". ~ on .

;; Before departing on this errand, he had prepared Mr.

turtevant’s bath, and laid outyhis clothing for the day, I
toffwhich both master and man had been looking forward l

ith some pleasurable anticipation.
Morris had been absent from the room long enough
ithatnow upon his return he expected to ﬁnd that Mr.
urtevant had ﬁnished his bath, and was awaiting his

c‘j1gfast,v‘perhaps with some impatience; and it Wasp’
hforc, witli notVa little surprise that he discovered

eclining upon a sleepy-hollow chair near one of the

.win aural 9"? nth: Mic; t‘

   

it against the door was intended merely as an announce? '

11- with hisbbathrobé,

thrown about him,» and apparently in precisely the same
position in which he had lefthirn, almost three-quarters
of an hour earlier. '- *

Sturtevant’s back was half toward the valet, so,tl1at ,

there was no view of his face possible; but Morris knew;
because of the tousled condition of his master’s hair,itha,t_
he had not been near the bathroom, and he doubted’ if
Mr. Sturtevant had‘ moved at all since he left him. \
Roger Sturtevantdid not turn his head,‘ or move, or
make any sign of recognition when his valet entered
room, and the latter moved silently across it, andfd .
posited his tray upon-a side table, while he proceeded to
prepare another and a smaller table for the;accomn*1o’da-
tion of the dishes and food. > A M
_ He went about his work silently, as was, his custom,‘
and had everything in readiness for Sturtevant to sit at
the table before he spoke to him; and. then, in\his.quiet
and unobtrusive voice, he announced: 7 ’ / ’.  
f‘Your breakfast is A‘ served, sir.’’? i  
Sturtcvant ‘gave no sign that he heard,,and the yalet
waited defercntially a moment or two, when he; ”
peated, this time in. a little louder tone: 
“Breakfast is served, Mr.‘ Sturtevant.”.

iiother short "silence,-during which he wondered it his ~
‘master had dropped asleep again. in the chair, stepped

lightly across the room, and touched him upon the shoul-A

Jmething peculiar in the attitude of his master, ancl,with
' udden tightening of the lips and -a‘ feeling of fright

far forgot ‘his usual’ conduct as to shake his master

to ghly by ;the shoulder, and tocall out, this time ‘with

dimly asked for Nick Carter’s number. '

‘fMr. Sturtevant is dead,” he announced, with that same
cold e_x,actitude, as soon as he received an answer; and
en, without waiting for a ‘further’ reply—-without real-

where he had found his master.’ ,

Again he passed around infront of him, and stood‘

  in the least to Whom he had made this announce.-r "

' all that his attitude and the
' 7 cated. i

happened that the detective ﬁt theother end of their in less dropped into that position by the relaxation of

he now occupied, and that the hand that dcaltthe

y then, without turning,

  

so absorbed in his contemplation of the body of his rnas-',
ter thathe heard nothing, and it was then that the d _"
tective opened the door and entered the room, to come"

  

    

Even then Morris did not turn his head, or give any
indication that he was aware of the interruption; it
seemed as if _he were hypnotized into semi-unconscious;
ness by the horror of the scene that confronted him, and
by the shock that had fallen upon him by reasonof this
sudden and unexpected death, of his master. ‘ 

As Nick stepped into the room,‘ he saw that 
was entirely unconscious ofhis presence, and sohe clos _
the door ‘softly, and then moved silently around until he
was behind the valet, and, therefore, occupied the same
point of vantage for viewing the body of the dead 
that Morris did. What he saw has already been idly
scribed, in effect. l g I W M ' i ,

The young millionaire was seated in the depths of th ‘5
sleepy,-hollow chair, and, save for the fact that" his eyes
were open and staring, he might have been‘ sleeping for’

so that it was doubtful if the victim had seen, 5: I *

NICK CARTER mmws ON ms IMAGINATION. I

Nick Carter's regret that Roger Sturtevant had név
mentioned the subject of the tattoo marks to him iivas,
course, useless, but nevertheless quite naturaltynotwif
standing‘ the intimacy that had endured between the
however, the subject had never been touched upon’ n‘d
until this moment Nick Carter had been as ignorant,
it as he had kept his other friends and acquaintances.

But the detective could not doubt that the appearan
of the marks upon his back had made a great impress
and-a lasting one, upon the mind of, Roger Sturtevant;

Knowing the character of the deadgman as he did,
detective could understand now ho’w7Sturtev'ant had sp, ,
many hours of thought upon the mystery of it, wonder
how it came there; wondering why __it was therelxandi
endeavoring by every means in his power to studyout
meaning of it. . . V q

tective kl wing that both men were dead beyond a  7
sibility q offering any explanation of the -mystery, coui
only determine that Rogerls father had either notkni I 
the meaning of it or had utterly refused to reveal it. p
A But it is almost an axiom that ‘where tattooinarks i
placed upon the body of an infant they are iput ther
purposes of identity, and the mere existence of this
leads naturally tothe further conclusion that ident 
tion may some time become necessary either thro’
mixing upof two infants or because of ailost or tel‘
identity with which the one infant may be associated,

. In this case, however, there were plainly two youngst

THE COUNTERFEIT DUEL.

Nick Carter was now convinced that there was abso-
utely, no. information to be obtained from Lawton, the

db ler, and he, therefore, dismissed him, telling him that f

,«e might retire as soon as he cared to do so, for the

“h0urAwas already late; but he returned to Mrs. Bundy,

pandi made one last effort with her, which, however, re-
‘fhlted no better, for, although she seemed’ willing to,
or’ ply to any questions which referred abstractly to the
ject,sshe was no less stubborn in regard to the vital
Hits of the incident.
,,When,lhe had dismissed her, also, he called ,Morris
and Patsy to him, and the three seated themselves ,to~
ether in a room by themselves, for the detective had
do ermined upon attempting a trick’ which he thought
might draw the information he wanted from the old
butler. T , . y i t M .

jg’ “lWhen did he come liere?”

“He came with the body, sir. . He wears a beard and
mustache, and, therefore, does not look like the Sturte-
vants. He was here at the moment of your arrival, but
he kept in the background, out of your sight. He did

' i “What?”
“It was I, sir. I did it alone. I tried to turn the
key from the outside, with a pair of pinchers, as I have
heard that burglars sometimes do. But I‘ could not do
‘_it, and so I went around through the house and carried
‘the body out to the lake. I carried it to the boat, and
, rowed with it outupon the lake; and then I tied a crow-.
. bar to it, and sunk it-——in the middle of the pond, sir.

“Go on. Go on.”

 “You arrived at just that moment, sir. Robert ran
to me for conﬁrmation of the news; He believed that
,the woman who committed the murder~—whom he sup«
posed committed the murder—:—had also stolen the body,
 he said to me, in his rapidway: ‘It will not do for
.;me to appear in_ this, Lawton, but I will ﬁnd that body,
 ‘and also the murderer, before you see me again.’ I have
not seen him since that moment, sir.”

‘They were interrupted at that moment by a violent

ered from the lake. The third man was rather tall, and
bearded, and Nick guessed at once that he was Robert-v
Sturtevant, returned. ‘ ‘

“You are Mr. Carter, I take it,” said the bearded
stranger, at once; and he spoke in a‘ frank, easy tone,
which at once impressed the detective. “I may as, well”
tell you at once that there is a mystery in this family‘
which we will force old Lawton to explain to you ‘later
But, for the present, it is suﬂicient to say that I am re-
lated to the family. My name is Robert Sturtevant.:’.,"»fl“
These two men are the gardeners. One of them saw“ "
old Lawton sink the body of mycousin in thelake, in”
the afternoon of yesterday. He told me about it, and '
together we dragged the bottom of the pond, in the
darkness, till we found it. Will you let us enter, sir ?’g"j"

The body of Roger Sturtevant was returned to the
casket, Morris being summoned at once to attend to that,_
while Nick led Robert Sturtevant at once to the room’
where he had left Lawton. I .

They found the old man there, precisely as Nick had I
left him, but he was grinning hideously to himself, and;
repeatingplover and over again the words: . V ;,V

“To right a wrong.. I did it. .I did it.. To right a 
wrong. I did it. I did it.’.’ 2 p 

Over and over, over and over, with never a change; 
His mind had become a total blank in the short tinie
since the detective left him. _ «-

It only remains to be said that Lawton was takento
an asylum, where he died a month later, without ever
recovering a glimmer of reason. . ‘ '  I

Thorough investigation by the detective, established
the absolute trutlrof all that the old butler had‘ told
him~—~that he alone was guilty of the double crime; and
that Robert Sturtevant was in no way connected with
it. - I .. ~

And so it came out that Lawton had righted a wrorig
after all, for Robert Sturtevant was theonly heir to the
fortune that Roger left, and so itfell to him, naturally.
But when the case was closed, and,Patsy and his: 
were discussing it, Nick said to his assistant: -  _ I

“It all goes to show, my lad, how easy it is for 
best of us to be deceived by appearances. I have ‘ala
ways thought that by putting two and two together, yet
would get four; but here is a case where therewas né
result at all, aihd where I would never have guess;ed-th,e
truth; where it could -onlybe discovered throughiha
ing it told by some one who knew.” I T

forrgers? Supposing they were, in what direction must
he look for the outlaws? One thing the detective thought
was certain——namely, that by some’ means they must have
. known what valuable property was in the safe. Another
;_thing seemed equally clear, namely, that they must have
known the position of the safe. _
; «-" Roquepine made his way once more to see the envelope
and its contents. He examined these mementos of the
j7ucr_'im‘e with great care, and he made a discovery. Inside
the ﬂap of the envelope were a few ﬁgures in pencil. They
were very indistinct, but with the use of a powerful lens
Roquepine made them out thus:

 

17,400 francs.
 It

 
 

17,670

 
  
 

_ e Now, the question was, what did these ﬁgures signify?
“To what did they relate? -The detective ‘copied them,
took them away with him, and meditated over them far
into the night. He reached no satisfactory conclusion.
Next day he went to see M .’Bouloy. _,

I “Monsieur,” he said “what do you make these ﬁgures
to signify .7” . *

  

   

l strikes me is that it is an addition of 17,400 francs and

370 francs.” ’ _ . ‘_
“Under what circumstances would you add ﬁgures

together in that way ?” the detective asked. ’ .

"  Bouloy smiled. - —

_ “How could I tell?” (said he. "‘Under any circum’-

§tanc§s,'when I wished to reach the amount of two.num-

ers. T
‘  .“When do you”do this kind of sum most frequently,
rnonsieur ?” was the next question.

‘7When I am adding the interest to the principal,” was
he answer. , - .

7~";1’hat'is it!” exclaimed the officer. “Now I have it.
One or the other of these parties had 17,490 francs on de-
posit somewhere, and on drawing it, they put the ﬁgures
down and added the interest. I have a, clue at last.”
