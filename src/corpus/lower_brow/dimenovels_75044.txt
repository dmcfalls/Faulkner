- ed his back toward him, and the boy studied it,
mainly because he had to look in that direction
anyway.

“I wonder who he is, and why he wants to
see my uncle? Must be some old acquaintance of
by-gone years. Mr. Bland seems to have shaken
all his foimer friends, for he never writes a letter
nor receives one. How then was this man able
to trace him to this locality? I don’t like his

, looks fcr a cent. He hasn’t got an honest face.
His photo wouldn’t look out of place in a ~rogue’s

. * gallery. He seems to feel pretty conﬁdent of see-
i ing Mr. Bland. Well, it’s nothing to me, but it’s
my opinion that my uncle will decline the honor of

an interview. If he wcn’t make friends with the
respectable people in the neighborhood, it is hard-
ly likely he'll hold any communication with this
cimp. I suppose I’ll have to take him back to the

/ whajrf, for it’s a long walk to town around by the
roa- ."

Here Bob ran the boat alongside the landing on

  ‘ "tire other side of the creek, let the sail down with

“ ,a run. and stepping; ashore, ran forward and
, grabbed the mooring line, which he attached to a
.‘  ring and secured with a sailor's. hitch. The stran-

’ g'er required no invitation to disembark. Bob
’ found him on‘ the landing when he turned around.
“That’s the house, is it?” said the man, nod-

 ding toward the cottage that stood on the other

sideof a row of trees.

“That’s ,where Mr. Bland lives,” replied the

I,;“All right, you don’t have to tell me.

said ,Bob, turning his back on him andx taking

cottage, smoking his cigar with the utmost non-

in his horns and return to town,” thought
Bob. The boy was was in no hurry to reach
the cottage while the stranger was there. After
carrying the packages a few steps, Bob laid -
them down under a spreading tree and seated _
himself beside them. He had an idea that the
stranger would be back in a short time, after an‘
unsuccessful attempt to gain admission to the
cottage, and would want him to take him back
to the wharf, so he thought it would save time.
to wait for him. Five-—ten--ﬁfteen minutes
passed, but the stranger did not returi'i,and the v
boy grew impatient.

“I wonder if he’s camped out in the front‘
yard waiting for me because he has found that .
he couldn’t get inside without help?” thought Bob.

“I’d let him wait with all the pleasure in the

world, only I’m in a hurry to get dinner. May‘
be I could slipyin the back way without attract- .
ing his attention. I’ll try.” , .

Bob caught up his bundles. and started for the
house. When he passed through the. trees he’
saw no sign of the stranger about. ,He laid the
bundles down beside the-kitchen doorstep and‘ ,-
walked around front. The man was not there. I I T
Bob found the front door and foundiitlocked,
as it usually was. i. '

“Can it really- be that my uncle has let that
chap in? It’s mighty strange if he has. He'll ' ~
be the first visitor Mr. Bland has seen for 'a 
mighty long time. The fellow seemed sure of W '
getting an interview. If he’s got it hemust
be some pa-rticular old friend of Mr. Blancl’s Q
though he doesn’t look to me like thekind of.
person my uncle would care to talk to. Well, I'll .
soon ﬁnd out if he’s got in,” said the boy.

He returned to the rear, unlocked the kitchen . _
door, picked up his bundles and entered. , Plac- ‘~f»“
ing the packages on the table he opened the - ‘I
door leading into the hallway connecting with the 1 _ 
sitting-room, and listened. He heard a lowvmur- . ;
mur of voices, but the sounds did not come from 
upstairs, which meant Mr. Bland’s own room.

“Well, I’ll be jiggered; the chap has not (only ~‘
got in, but Mr. Bland has taken him to his own ,
room—a most unheard-of circumstance,” thouglit“

  

 

above. “Well, it’s no business of mine what my
uncle does in his own house. He’s the boss of ' 
the ranch. Only it seems funny he would hebnob _i
with that chap. I must get dinner ready, for it's
getting on to noon.”  =

He returned to the kitchen, ‘started the draught > .;.

‘chief meal of the day. - A ‘

CHAPTER II.—'l‘om Barker.

 

Bob had just put some otatoes on to boil, when  ’ i :
the bell connected with is unc1e’s room rang.- ’ 
That was a iifnal to the boy that he was wanted ; '
upstairs by r. Bland. He lost no time in am '1-N.
swering it. He wondered if he would now ,le'arri '
the identity of the stranger. He foundhis uncle
standing at the head of the stairs, ‘ c i -

“Bob, I have ’a visitor-——the man’ youtbrougllg

, 7 “Oh!” replied Mr. Bland, with a look of relief.

“Lock up as usual, and you needn’t come back
till it’s time to get supper.”
“All right, sir; I was thinking of going down
tothe lake in the boat and taking a sail. There’s
a spanking breeze,” said Bob.
‘ As he turned from the door Bob could have
V sworn he saw the top Of1T0Il1 Barker’s'head dis-
appear down the stairs. V
A “That chap has been listening,” he muttered.
“I hate sneaks.” r ‘ _ ‘
, When he returned, to the kitchen he found
' , Barker where he had left him, at the door, but

that = was no evidence that he hadn't crept up-"

stairs to hear what passed between Bob and his
uncle. ’ »

~‘«,‘Comei along,” said Bob, locking the kitchen

A ,  They had gone about a yard when it occurred
a to the boy that he ‘hadn’t tried the windows.
— Then he remembered that’ he hadn’t opened
. either one since his return. He thought he’d
_ trythem, anyway, so he starter back.
“What are you going back.for?” asked Barker.
 “To try. the windows.”

 his cousin. . , V
 , Nevertheless Bob did not turn from *his'pur-
ﬂpose. He tried the one to the left of‘ the door
’ and found it fa-st.~ . ,
, , V‘ “I told you they were all right,” said Barker.
* f‘Come on ;, I’m in a hurry.” '
* Bob never did things by halves‘, and accord-
_ j ingly he went to the other window. A dark look
 came over Barker’s face when he saw that the
 would do ‘as he pleased. When Bob tried
the window on /the right he found, somewhat to
, his surprise,‘ that it was unlatched. He wondered
if"he had left it that way when he went to town
in the morning. He had to go in and lock it.
 “I‘ don't see that it makes much difference
 "whether it’s locked or not,” said" Barker.,.in a
‘ surly tone. “There don’t seem to be anybody
 arou’nd*here‘, and Mr. Bland is in the house "and
 "would hear, any one that got in the house.”
1..  “His orders areto lock up when «‘I go away,
' ' and’ I follow them,” replied Bob.
 .Nothing more was said‘on the subject, and
[ﬁfteen minutes later Bob put his cousin ashore
 the wharf, then turning the boat's nose down

ﬁgured. at about 300 yards. Just as the sailboat
passed that line Bob caught sight of the hand-

some little sloop yacht he had followed as far as

the island an hour before. She was coming out
from behind the opposite side of the island at 8.
rapid clip. Evidently she had been up to the
other end of the lake.

“Isn’t she a beauty. Will?” said Bob.

“Bet your life she "is. Say, there’s a girl
aboard of her. I wonder if that’s her father
with her?”

“He knows how to sail a boat all right, who-
ever he is,” said Bob.

“He needs to in this wind. If I d_idn’t know

take a thimbleful in. Glenn isn’t overhauling us
so fast after all.” ' ,

“He isn’t doing any better. He’s had totake
a reef in his mainsail.”

While they were talking the fancy yacht, sail-

’ ing diagonally across their course, crept up quite

close. They could see the girl very clearly now.
She was dressed in a neat sailor suit, with a
straw hat from which ﬂoated a streamer, and

' was undoubtedly pretty.‘

“She’s a peach, Bob,” said Will, who had a
weakness, like most boys, for the fair sex.

“That’s what she———'good gracious!” ,

The exclamation was drawn from Bob by a sud-

of the boom to which the sheet was attached’
snapped short off, the force of the wind ripped
the mainsail right up to the gaﬂ’, the released,
boom followed the wind, while the gaff was held-

by the torn strip of canvas with the end of tho '_ ..
This caused “ V "

was spilled outof -the sail. .

 Asia consequence, the girl who was sittin ihigli  x 
up on the windward side of the cockpit, with

a low rail behind her, pitched backward, heag ~

 

over heels into the lake, and disappeared beneath" 

the surface.

 

CHAPTER IV.——-Bob to the Rescue. A

The catastrophe came so sudden that the two, if

boys were dazed by it.“ _As they gazed over the l .
waters they saw the girls straw hat with itsp

streamer bobbing up‘ and down on the choppy
seas, and the girl herself ‘was out of sight. The
yacht had already been carried some distance

away from the spot where the accident »happened,», '

but the sailboat was close to it. ~
,“,Th[e_re she is,” cried Will, pointing. ' . 
Bob looked and saw the - girl’s head appear‘
above, the surface. He headed the boat for her"
but just as-he reached out to seize her by thehair

\a wave whisked her out of his reach. He brou ht,-

‘By the greatest good luck he made out the girl

‘and picked it up_. It was a man’s ﬁnger ring—
a‘ coiled snake with a ruby imbedded in its head.
‘Not only that, but he remembered having seen
a’ ring just like it on Tom Barker’s middle ﬁnger.
“What’s that?" asked the policeman. ~“A ring!
7 Is it yours?” = d

“No, it isn’t mine. I just picked it upun er

positive evidence that somebodywas in this room

“Ah!” said the officer. “We have'got hold of

have caused him to change his mind.” i

i {That is rather an odd ring, and it would be a

CHAPTER VIII.—-Bob Calls at the Willcutt 7
Home. - 9

Hiram B1and’s death was duly noted in the‘ ‘
Cadiz newspapers, but without any hint as to
foul play. Nor was it intimated that he had com- ..
mitted suicide. On the suspicion that the dead ’
man's nephew, Tom Barker, who had failed to
turn up at the cottage again, knew something
about Hiram Bland’s untimely taking oﬂ",’a de-
tective had been detailed to look him up. Mr;
Bland was duly buried, and as no will had been ,-
found, the cottage was taken possession of by.
the Cadiz official, whose business it was to ad-
minister on the estates of people who died in-. -
testate. The cottage was undoubtedly the prop- .,
erty of the deceased, and his only-known heirs; ,

‘ being Bob and Tom. Barker, it would have to be 
-eventually sold, together with its contents, and 

what was realized therefrom‘, after all fees and. -
expenses had been paid, would be divided among 5'
his two nephews. As the property was not very _
valuable. they- were not likely to get much out ‘of j .
the estate. It would take some time to put  _
mat-ter through the court, so the public admin;-' .';,_
istratoradvertised the cottage for rent. He told vg
Bob he could stav there until he found a tenant._.~i 

“I’m thrown on my own resources at last," '
thought Bob, after he had shown the oﬁicial’
through the house, and that individual had taken
his departure, after advancing the boy $10rtoU _«
cover his immediate expenses. “I would be in
rather a tight ﬁx but for the fact of having ,1
Mr. Willcutt’s friendship and thus secured, my- I Jj
self an opening in his new factory. I will now.» 
be able to learn a trade and get ahead ,ln~'tIle'_
world, andthat will suit me to'a T. I guess “
I can’t do better than call on Mr. Willcutt and ;
tell him that I am in a position to accept ‘his .{ I
offer. He has doubtless read of my uncle’s sud-‘~ / 
den death in ‘the papers, and will be expecting “
to hear from me right away.” , . ,_

Accordingly, Bob walked down to the creek‘ to.
make the trip to Mr. Willcut.t’s home in his sail"-
boat. His ﬁrst ideawas to go to the factory,
but as that was not yet completed, he judged that 
he was more likely to ﬁnd the factory owner
at his home than in town. He had another rea- _
son, too, for giving Mr. Wi1lcutt’s home the pref-’ ' ‘
erence, and that was it would. probably afford ‘L;
him an opportunity of meeting the fair Miss 1’ 
Bessie again. The wind was light as he passed
down the creek. .

“I would give something to know where Tom“ 
Barker has taken himself off to,” he mused. “His-
disappearance is decidedly suspicious, taken in
connection with my uncle's mysterious death,,ancl"
the discovery of the snake. ring in my roo'm.,
Can it be that Barker, came back to the cottage -
-while I was away, entered through my room"

him, and then made off with whatever plunder.“

evening when he came back. Then that remark /.
he made to me that perhaps I might be better} .

light ‘of what has. happened, I would seem pas’

moment that my uncle was dead? If he did,
then he must have been responsible for the trag-
edy. If he had no handin it why hasn’t he re-
turned to the house, since he has as much right

there now as I have? I’m afraid to say what I‘

think. Barker’s reputation is against him, though
I never heard that he was guilty of any criminal
act. If he really killed Uncle Hiram I am sure

have got away with my uncle’s money in that

on the Willcutt property, he saw the natty yacht

new sail for the wrecked one.

veranda fronting on the lake. As soon as she

 recognized him she dropped the magazine she
‘ .,was looking at and hastened to meet him.

_ “This is a pleasant ‘surprise, Mr. Howard,” she
said, offeringhim her hand. ,
- “I’m glad to see you again, Miss Willcutt. Is

  your father at home?” asked Bob.

 

"i“‘I presume you will get his property?

“No he hasn’t returned from town, where he
-went directly after dinner. You wish to see him,

* '1, suppose?”

 “Yes. I called to tell him that I am ready, to

- go to work in his factory whenever he is ‘ready
to take me on. I suppose you have heard about
jmy uncle’s sudden death?” ' '

“Father told us. There was an account in the
paper. I I sympathize with you in your loss- It
isvery ‘sad when a member of one’s family is

' taken away, particularly so unexpectedly. He

was your only living relative, I believe?”
I “The only one except a cousin, whom I have

he leave a will?’

“None at all?” exclaimed Mr. Willcutt, in ad

lived without some means ‘of support. As he

JLEARJNING A TRADE I V I 15

and then resumed their playing, Jimmy joining
in the game, and thinking it a lot better than
toiling in the shop. Work at the factory stopped
at half-past ﬁve. Bob and Phil Daly usually came
out together and walked a couple ofblocks in_
each other’s company. On this occasion the fore-.
man of their department detained Bob after he_
had changed his clothes and was ready to de-
part, as he wanted him to carry several packages’;
of wire work to Mr. Willcutt’s home, the pro-,1

‘ prietor having instructed him to send the fancy "

wire articles by the_boy.

Jimmy and his crowd were waiting at the
corner for Bob to come along. They had selected
this spot because the corner was a vacant lot
surrounded by a wooden fence, and because most
of the factory employees went off in the other
direction, and Bob was not likely to get any help,
from his friends. Jimmy had directed some of
his cronies to tackle Phil Daly, who he expected
would be with Bob, and hold him off while the
rest, including himself, made matters warm for
the real object of their attack. Soon after work
stopped at the shop Jimmy saw Daly coming ».:
along alone. This rather surprised him, so leav- 1
ing the bunch, he strolled up to Phil and asked
him where Bob Howard was.

‘.‘What do you want with him?” asked Daly,
curtly. .

“I want him to git the foreman to take me
back.” =

“You don't deserve to be taken back. You tried
to put that job he was working at on the bum,
just to get him in trouble.” v 1 .

“I was mad at him, but I’m sorry now I tried’ 1
to hurt him,” replied Jimmy, trying to assume a
penitant look.

“Yes, your’i~e sorry because you got it in the. "
neck. I don’t believe the foreman will take you
back even if Bob asked him to, and I doubt if I ;
Bob will do it. You have gone the limit with!
him, and he isn’t sorry you are out of the shop." .

At that moment Jimmy saw Bob come out of the ’ _ '
shop door, with three or four bundles under his ‘
arms, and head that way, so he said no more,
but turned on hisiheel and rejoined his friends,
while Daly went on his way.

« “He’s comin’, fellers,’ said Jimmy. “Be ready
to tackle him as soon as you see me sail in. Git
hold of the bundles and chuck ’em over the fence
into the lot.” , '  - V

Bob came along unsuspicious of the trouble‘ that 5 
was in store for him: As he started across the ’ ’ ‘
street, Jimmy, followed by his crowd, advanced 
so as to intercept him. The moment Bob spied
his enemy, and noticed the bunch in his wake, he
began to sent a scrap. He knew Jimmy Byke.
was aching to mix things up with him, and he. be—.-
lieved the hard youth meant to bring things to?‘ ~
an issue now, and had fetched his friends to see
the fun.

“If that’s his game, I’ll give him all he Wants," "
muttered Bob, holding the bundles so that he-"
The moment Bob“
reached the opposite curb Jimmy walked. up to
him in a threatening way. . i {I

 that ildob’s face. l3ob' ducked, let go oflhis bundles

The crowd behind
uttered a shout and closed in on Bob. Biff! Bob’s

‘ // of his tormentors, and the boy’ measured his

length on the ground. The plucky 1ad’s prowess

‘; Cstaggered the rest of the bunch, and they scat-

 and he sneaked off in the opposite direction.

Bob

’when he saw his adversaries making’ oil’ as fast

.‘ as they could go.

“There wasn’t much ﬁght in either Jimmy

little wharf. ~ ~ V

CHAPTER X.—What Bob saw in the Looking-
 . ‘ glass.

, . Bob carried the bundles to the cottage and got
his supper before starting in his saidboat or
" the Willcutt home. Mr. Willcutt was on the
veranda alone‘ when he arrived, and he asked
thegentlemani what _he should do with the pack-

in a bad light. While he was weighingthe mat-’ 
ter it suddenly occurred to him that the fact of
no money being found after Mr. Bland’s death, _’
reﬂected upon himself. He remembered that the 5 
public administrator had catechized him rettyi ’
sharply on the subject, as if he suspectedt e boy.’-:1
had taken possession of his uncle’s money, intend-
ing to keep it and say nothing about it.
Perhaps Mr. Willcutt might entertain 9.’ similar ,
suspicion, but would not, of course, utter a hint;

 

about it. The very idea of falling the least bit ., 

in the estimation of Bessie’s father was too much
for him to stand, and so he decided to tell Mr.‘ ' ’
Willcutt everything‘. This he did, and that g'entle- .
man heard him with not a little surprise. 3 -’
“I’m afraid this-cousin of your-sis a rascal of l
the ﬁrst water,"’,said thegentleman. “It looks
as if he was the cause, maybe unintentionally» of
your uncle’s death, and that he deliberately
robbed the house while you were away, covering

Bob took a walk around the grounds together
for an hour or so, after which he returned to
the cottage in his boat. Thus the weeks" passed
and Bob made good progress at his trade.‘ Atﬂhis
old factory Mr. Willcutt had bought all the wire
he usediinhis business, but when he put up his
new factory in Cadiz he added"to his establish-

ity largely in excess of his own wants., It was
originally his intention to start Bob atI‘work_ in’
this mill, as he intended to make the manufacture
of wire his chief business, but the failureof 

.. machinery to arrive when promised caused liixn

put the boy into one of the wire «goods» depart’.
ments for the time -being. Three months elapsed
before the mill was ready to start up, and -then
Bob was at once transferred to it./. He ‘was :de-'-
lighted with the change, for he was anxious-
learn the trade of wire-making. . ._ 1.  "

It was the groundwork of the whole wire. in
dustry, and to rise tobecome the superintendent
of theworks, as Mr. Willcutthad intimated to
him. that he wished him to do, it "was necessary

— that he should be thoroughly acquainted with the

process. Bob had the idea, in common with most
people, that wire is drawn hot. His first week in
the mill dis elled that, impression, for helfourid

even turn .his head, as he would have done had
‘the sound been more pronounced, for his ﬁrst_fim—

‘casidned by the cracking of the woodwork, though
it was true that the house had been built so long
that the framework was pretty well set. j~A min.-

. .he had put there as ,a precaution on entering the

After inspecting the fastenings of the frontidoor

that; it was now open about three inclies,gand

'its own volition, until the boy saw the ﬁngers of
a hand upon the edge of it. At that moment it
‘ struck Bob that the intruder, when he looked
into the room, would see the mirror right ahead,
and catch his (Bob’s) eyes in the glass staring
at him. That would cause him to beat a quick
retreat. So the boy placed one elbow on the
table, bent his head forward, and looked through
,lllS partly open ﬁngers. Presently a head was
:c“.l2.ul'.lOl1Sly pushed through the opening in the
oor.

It was a man’s head, and Bob caught a clear
view of his face as he looked into ‘the room. He
almost spoiled things by the start he -gave, for
_the countenance he saw was that belonging to
Tom Barker.

CHAPTER XI.——Barker’s Confession.

“My cousin, Tom Barker,” breather Bob. “So
iie’s come back. How the dickens did he get into
the house, and what was his object in entering
on the sly? He’s- looking at me pretty hard,

' and his look isn’t the most pleasant in the
- world. Does he intend to attack, or-——ah, the
. rascal!”
. The last words were drawn from Bob when he
saw Barker step forward and slowly raise a cud-
gel he held in his hand. His intention was evi-
dent——to strike Bob down as soon as he got with-
inreach. Bob let him advance three paces, and
,then as Barker raised his stick higher the boy
suddenly wheeled around and covered his cousin
.' with his revolver. Barker started back as if he
 had trod on a venomous reptile, and uttered a
VL, » smothered imprecation.

- “Well, Tom Barker, what brings you here, and ‘

what are you up to?” asked Bob, cooly.

His cousin glared at him without making any

reply.
' “ indly drop that club or I’ll drop you,” con-
tinued Bob. “Thought you’d catch me unawares,
did you? You see your mistake. I’m a weasel,
‘ ; and sleep with both. eyes wide open. I can see
what’s going on behind me, too, for I saw you
come in at that door as softly as though you
were treading on eggs.”

“Point th t gun another way, Bob Howard,”
growled Ba ker. “What, do you mean by cover-
ing me with it?” v
 “.‘You’ve got a most magniﬁcent nerve, Cousin
Barker, which, under. other circumstances,

“ niight admire. Stop! Don’t you dare try to go
‘ back through that door. If you do you’ll be
carried out of here on a stretcher. If you think

I don't mean business, try me.” .

“Why—why, what’s the matter? This is a
ﬁne‘ reception you are giving me,” blustered

Barker. _

. _,“I’m,giving you what you deserve. There’s a

chair in the corner, sit down in it, and don’t for-

-' ' I that stick-—-drop‘ it, do you hear?”

so sharply that Barker let it fall

with an imprecation. “Now sit down. ,I’m not

"going, to tell you again. ,Do as I say, or take
the consequences.”

_Barker moved over and sat down.

; Bob got up and closed the door; through which
his‘ cousin had entered. but he never removed
ahis eyes ‘from the man..

“I’ll bet this is the way he got in. ,I.don’t 
any other way," thought Bob, “I'll p”uta Ikibbsli

death was now satisfactorily established. _He
could ha:-dly.consider Barker a‘ murderer, since
he had not intended to compass the old mans
death; but nevertheless he wasea very guilty
man. . ,

Bob ‘hopedthat he never would see him again,

buthe was afraid he would, and in as unex-

" pected a way as before. _Finally he dropped
asleep and did not awake till his usual hour for
rising. When he got back from work that after-
noon he not only made an unusual careful survey

. of the cottage from the outside, but with his re-

; . volver in his hand he went from room to room

' ‘to make sure he had no undesirable visitor on

the premises. Of course the only undesirable
‘visitor he looked for was his cousin. ,
Having lsatisﬁed’ himself on this point, he re-

i turned’ to‘ the kitchen, cooked his supper and ate
it. Then his thoughts reverted to Barkerfs state-

_'ment that he believed the missing money was
hidden in some other part of the house than the

‘late Mr. Bland’s private apartment.

" “It hardly seems reasonable that he would keep»
his money, ifhe had much, anywhere but under ~

“He

 

his own eyes,” thought Bob, reﬁectively.
,, * ‘could easily have had a secret receptacle made
’ under the floor of his room. Come to think of
v. »it,Vsu’ch .a spot may exist there in one of the
” i “corners. I didn't look for such a thing when I
. saw that the carpet was fastened close down all
"over the room. ‘My uncle may have taken up

i ‘wanted to reach his hoard. ‘It'won’t take lon
, 'for_me to“ investigate the ﬂoor under’ the.ends o

i _ The appearance of one of his friends at‘ that
moment. interrupted his train of "thought, and
‘he did not think of the matter again till he went

 
  

 

, breakfavst he locked up downstairs and devoted
the entire morning to. an investigation of the
ﬂoor of his late uncle’s room. Nothing came of
it, for he» found the ﬂoor perfectly solid all the
\» way round. He examined the desk again for a
’ false bottomior a secret drawer, but there ap-
pearedto be none in it. Then his‘ thoughts re-
“ ‘verted to the vacant room’ below, secured by the
Yale lock. Hehad never been inside of it during
' the three years he lived at the cottage, nor had
he ever seen his uncle go near it,either_.' As the
windows had never beenopened, nor —-the room
‘swept,’ he judged that_ it must be in a pretty
‘musty and dirty COndlt10n. ~After his uncle’s
death he had looked for the key,‘intending to
cleanit out, but the key could not be found’. He
tried to open “the closed blinds on the outside,
‘thinking to get in that way_, but found they were
+3ec‘ure1y nailed upon the inside. ~ So he let the

   

   

room alone as he did not care to destroy’ the V

‘blinds, or to force the door, not believing it was
orth whileylsince he had no use for the room.
» t ﬁrst it struck him as singular that a Yale
, “lock should be on thedoor of »a vacant room, but
concluded that itmay have been put, on by the
former tenant, and so dismissed the matter from

~ his,mind.~’ Now, however, that the money Mr. .»
Bland-» was supposed to have possessed was not;‘

-to be found in‘ his own room after the strictest

kind of. search, Bob began to wonder if the old’

‘ man had hidden it in the vacant*ro,o.m. .'1‘h'is

.on top of the other, and the smaller ones within‘

i notice of the foreman.

I _ _ ~Bob cut one out, reached in his hand ,and_1turh

door, and also for his refusal to let him clean the ‘
room up. _ i , c ~
“I wonder where the key went to?” thought-
Bob, that Sunday morning after he had aban,-..
cloned the search in his late uncle’s" room. “If
it was of the ﬁrst importance to Uncle Hiram,
I should think’ it would have been attached to
his ring of keys. At any rate, it ought to be in
one of the drawers of his desk. I have already
found that it wasn’t on his key-ring‘, nor in a
drawer of the desk. It’s singular where it could
havegoneto, provided my uncle had occasion ,
to use it, and he certainly would haveoccasion w
to use it if he.-kept his money somewhere in that 7  \

vacant’ room.” — ;

Eager as Bob now was to inspect that room, g =
he did not care to break the door down in orderu 5
to satisfychis curiosity.’ » »  t

It was time for him to get ready to go to the  l
Willcutts for dinner, as had become his regular: 
custom of a Sunday, so he went to his room, put  
on his good clothes and started off in his boat: .
When Bob began work at the mill next day, his
services were called into requisition at a read 
ceptacle called a “nealer.” It was a large irongg l 
vessel, wider at the bottom than at the topgj 
built over a furnace, and ﬁlled withbrick from  s
the bottom to about four inches above the,outer ' . 
edge. The ﬁrst batch of wirein course of manu-T"; i
facture hadto be coiled in this vessel, onecoil’ ‘

 

the larger. Bob worked away some time at tlfﬁs; 
job, and ‘whenthe coils had been placed in posig, i ~
tion, the nealer was covered with an immense, , ,1 

l cover, which the foreman" called a bonnet, and  g

all the seams through’ which air might enter. g ~

were then covered with clay, so as to render 

everything air—tight. After that the [vessel was ﬂ 4, ‘l

gradually heated toa red heat",.‘and kept in that‘ 

condition several hours. Then the draughts were

shut down, and it was allowed to cool gradually.’ V
He was greatly interested in the different pro-

. cesses through which the iron rods were gradﬁ~

ually developed into wire of various» degrees of —‘
ﬁneness. He’ paid strict attention to “everything ,
he was called on to do. and he, did his work» as, . ‘
well ashe could, thereby attracting the favorable
V When. work shut down
Monday afternoon, Bob hunted up a locksmith

‘and consulted him about the feasibility o£.,open-3

ing a Yale lock w’ithout‘a key. _ i ,
. “Isn’t there any other.way_ of getting into the‘
room?” asked the locksmith. - .. 
“Yes by wrenching oﬂ a blind nailed on the in-
(s1ide’and cutting out a pane of glass in the win-_
ow" » 7» 2.‘ , '3'’
“Better do that than smash the door; for the
tumblers of a Yale lock can’t be picked throng‘
the narrow keyhole”, . ~, ‘  ‘ l
v  So Bob. went to a hardware store and bought, a’

'glazier’s diamond. He postponed trying: to ente
ithe» room till,the following Sunday morning;

he wished to do the job by daylight. »When'th'
time came, after breakfast on that day,_,—he.g‘
his tools and tackled the outside blind of one of
the windows.» Itwas so well nailed that he‘~had ‘to;
tear it all to pieces before he -couldgget. at Q
‘window. The panes were so thickly coated -
dust that it was impossible to see ~- through the

%

the catch. -

 
 
 

 

  

_. He found it impossible to shove up the sash,
aneither could he pull down the upper, so the only
To conclusion he could reach, was that they were
» _‘.-tightly nailed. It was now apparent that he
' '.couldn’t. get in that way without smashing the
a whole of the lower sash. and that he .d1dn’t want

-to replace it. He looked into the room through
-the hole he had made by removing the pane, and
j.-found it pretty dark. )A_s far as he could make out

_ by his partial examination there wasn’t anything
at all in the room. While hewas staring at the
.1/blank surroundings, he was suddenly seized from
,=;il‘iehind and pulled away from the window.‘
qnoosed _rope was dropped over his head and pulled
"ctight around his arms, holding them as if in .a
vise. Thus he was rendered helpless before he
quite realized what he was up against. V Then one
of-his two captors stepped in front of.him and
.,s.;1Q‘oked at him’ with a grin ‘oif satisfaction. i The
';man was Tom Barker, looking more disreputable
;;than ever. '

him so. As the nearest neighbor was an eighth of’, 
a mile away, and there was scarcely any travel 
at all on a Sunday along the road which the cot,—‘
‘cage faced, there was but._1itt1e chance that the
two rascals would be interrupted in their ‘work, 2
The only chance that Bob couldjﬁgure on‘ was-*“,'-.
the appearance of one of his friends on the scene, 
and that was but a forlorn one, for he seldom had ‘ 
at visitor on a Sunday morning,.and of course no‘: 
body called in the afternoon or evening, because
they understood that he was always away then.-f _ 
Presently he heard a crash outside. He knew3 -_
what that meant. Barker and his companion had 
smashed in the lower sash. He heard, some minor
sounds after that for a moment or two and then 
there was silence. Perhaps ﬁve minutes passedgw;-j
after that when Bob was startled by what sounded». , "1
like the combined reports of several ﬁrearms, fol’-‘ '-
lowed by muffled cries. The sounds came from
inside the house, and, apparently, from the empty’
room. , ‘ ,' ~. 
“What in thunder was that?” ejaculated‘ Bob,_ .
listening intently. “sounded like threeor »;£ou1-;; ’
pistol shots in rapid succession, and I thought
heard cries of "distress on top of them. .I donlt
hear anything more. Seems kind of" funny =tof ;.,
, Iwonder what it all means. -'Phere,,isn?t,"
anybody in the house but those two rascals, s__o I,
don't see Why there should be any shooting”. «Guess »
my ears deceived me.”. v‘  . _ - _f 
More time passed ‘and’ still. the house remained “ ’
as silent as a tomb. ' " ., C 
“Can it be that they have got out of the Window’
and made off without me hearing them? ',I:t‘“they
have, that’s a pretty good sign .that..they-,ha2y;e

At that moment Bob heard a sh-rill whistle

severed the ﬁnal cord and Bob found himself free
once more. -

“Down on me! He hates

“Not at.al1. I’ve got a club and a revolve); in

around to the window they broke open and make
things lively for them if they’re about.”

The boys started at once for the "Window. Bob

 “I guess»they’ve skipped," he said. ‘,

What he saw caused him to utter an exclamation

“,What’s the matter?” asked Phil. ,
Bob made‘ no reply, but scrambled through
eiwwindow in a hurry. IHe had seen two forms
stretched/silent and motionless on the floor in
front of a large brass—bound box. He hardly
needed’ to approach them to know who they were.
Tom Barker lay on. his back, and Fletcher 'half
jreclined'on_ his side. What had happened to
"_ them Bob could" not imagine, but there seemed to
be little: doubt that both were unconscious

while Fletcher was still bleeding from two wounds
in his breast. Bob was paralyzed at the sight.

“Come in, Phil,” he called. “There’s been a
tragedy here, and I can’t ﬁgure out how it hap
pened.” , "

Daly got into the room much astonished at his
friend’s words. He was more astonished when he
viewed the two bodies.

“They were trying to open that box when they
were shot,” said Phil. , ‘

“I would appear so. They key is in the lock.
But’ how—-—-” . '

“I know,” cried Phil, suddenly. “Here, don’t
stand in front of that thing. It is lbaded for

. business, or was. Better leave things as they are

and send for the police.” , . .~
“What do you mean?” asked Bab. * ‘ 1,
“What do I mean? There is probably some»
thing of value in that chest, and it’s provided with y
a concealed set of revolvers, and the mechanism ~ '-
that sets them oif when the box is monkeyed with ‘
by any one but its owner. I’ve heard of such Q
contrivances before. They have been attached: ..
to doors and windows to give thieves who attempt 
to break into a house a warm reception.‘ I’ll bet . - "

o . . ,« '

“I wouldn’t. You can’t tell what might happen . ’ i
to us,” replied Phil. .  V
“Maybe it’s done all the damage it was intended’ ’ ,
to do. At any rate, we need not stand in front"
of it. Get over to that side.” ' «.

Phil did so. Then Bob took a ﬁrm grip on the  *
end of the lid and pulled it up. Nothing happened, — 
but they saw how the Inlen had met their deaths * “~ "
and the contrivance which had killed them. The _,
boxwas provided with a false top, in the lock or -
which probably the key had been left, because ’
Bob did not believe Barker had had the key in his
possession. Arranged at even distances were four ».
old-fashioned pistols, capable of ﬁring‘ but -one » -»
shot each. Their muzzles inclined upward-‘at an.  ‘
angle. To the trigger of each was attached a .
thin wire which connected with the lid in sucha ,
way that the moment it /was lifted a few inches.‘
enough to expose the muzzles of the pistols, the‘
wires were simultaneously drawn to a tension
that released the triggers, and the pistols were
discharged. The bullets were sure to strike any
mark within the space of two feet, and were
pretty certain to ﬁnd a bullet in any person /W'l’l'.4‘
tried to open the box as he would a trunk. There

 
 

" was nothing but the pistol battery in the top tray,

of the box, and Bob saw that this shallow tray
was. as we said~before, merely a false top, and
had no connection with the interior of the box:
proper. ' V - . L
“Well, what are you going to do, Bob? Notif

» Bob ﬁxed the look so it wouldn’t catch. and they
. made their way outside by Way of the hall and
, the kitchen. He went right down to the landing,
‘ , put oft‘ in his sailboat, and as the wind was favor-
able he made a quick’ trip around to the Willcutt
 property. He found the factoryowner walking
around his grounds. The gentleman was surprised
,to- see the boy so early in the day, as he was not
'1‘ expected much before two o'clock. Bob lost no
' ‘time in explaining the reason of his_early calls
, ’ The story he told of his capture by‘ his cousin and
another man. his imprisonment in the cellar, his
rescue by his friend Daly, and their discovery
of the tragedy which had taken place in the
vacant room of the cottage, astonished the gen-
tleman not a little. ,
:~ ' “You mustn’t open the box,” replied Mr. Will-
 ‘ .cutt. “That is the right of the public adminis-
 trator only, ‘and it would not do for me to be
‘ _.=.p‘resent and be a party to such a thing. It is
» tooﬂbad that your uncle failed to make a. will in
l { your -‘favor, which would have prevented the es-
}-tate falling in the ofﬁcial’s hands.”
 ~ “Maybe he did make a will, and it’s in the
.box,” said Bob. . ‘ '
'~~ “That’s true. I never thought of that. If there
' is a will, the public administrator will have to
step down and out.” * - .’
r % “Then I think I ought to be present when the
-hox,_is opened.” . ‘ ,
“You can prefer your request to the official.”
"7.".B'l1t I can’t make him open it in my presence,
7-can I?" Q ‘ ' .
“No. He can, and probably will, cause the box.
fto» be at Vonceremoved to hisvhouse."
. »‘-‘Suppose he found a will when he opened it,
and knowing} that its production, would cause him
‘to lose a fat commission, destroyed it, who but
. himself would know?”
- 'j“He would be assuming a grave risk.

«~“sh,ow_-that such a will ever existed?” said Bob.‘

 . “I don't think you need, fear he would do such a
'_‘-thing. He is under oath to perform the duties of
his oﬁice honestly and correctly.” . V

_ “In any case, I suppose I’ll have to trust to his
gghonesty. If I_ knew where the key of the box was,

to the police. As soon as hisfi-lend started off,
Hob, re-entered the chamber of death, and took
another look at the contrivance which had carried
"disaster to,Barker and Fletcher. While hewas
.1_ool:ing the box over _he saw that it had no other
key-hole. The box was brass-bound, and provided
we’; lot ,o’f1knobs.'7 Under the impression that
one Tof [these knobs had something to do with the
matter, he pressed hard on each in turn. When
he touchecl the third one to the right of the fake

patlghes directly under the false key-hole slipped
aside and another key-hole appeared- -

saw was a legal document with the printed word-
“Will” at the top of it. He snatched it up, opened" i
it, and found that it was the last will and testa-
ment of Hiram Bland.‘ It only took him two’
minutes to see that he was his uncle’s sole heir,
Tom Barker’s name not being mentioned atall. l
He determined that he would see what was in
thebox, now it was open, so he examined its
contents.’ He first took out a japanned box [about
a foot and a half in size. The key was in it-
Opemng it, he found it was full of packages of;
banknotes. Bob did not return the box of money
to the box, but took it down andjhid it in, the
cellar. Shortly afterward a police Wag‘on’drov5e‘:

policeman the contrivance that had caused the
death of his cousin and Fletcher, and told-» them’

  

  

  

  

tered the room. The bodies were then loaded on
the wagon and taken to town. An hour later Bob
started for the Willcutt home. After dinner he
told Mr Willcutt how he had opened the boxafter
a}l1l, anchtold him what he found in‘ it showing him
1: e wi . . ‘

. Next morning Bob didn’t apllear at the works,‘
but went with Mr. Willcutt to that gentleman’s
lawyer, to whom he turned over the will for ipro.-U
hate. The lawyer told him that the ﬁrst thin
the ‘judge would do would be to appoint a guard?-‘
ian for him, as none was mentioned in the will." 

Bob turned to Mr. Willcuttand asked him if
would serve, and he said he would, so that matt
was settled. During the next three years Bob
worked steadily at the mill, and when he had
mastered theknowledge of» wire making, hefwas
transferred to one aof the factory departments to
learn the wire goods trade". On’ his,.twent"  5
birthday.he becameforeman of his’ department.
A year later he was promoted to, be assistant
superintendent of the works. He also‘ became;
engaged to Bessie Willcutt, and six months‘ later
they ‘were married. He continued in his present
position for three years, andthen was put in full’
charge of the manufacturing business of his =
father-in-law. l » T 4,’ ‘

was a dead failure; but the bloodshed that fol-
lowed so frightened the girls that the fun was
spoiled for the evening.

The girls were of the impression that some of
the boys had been stabbed; but when the boys
had washed their faces, it was learned that the
blood that was seen had all come from bruised

I noses.

The young man who had been hit with the jug
of whisky was the worst-looking chap of the lot.

The young man whose jaw had been knocked
out of its socket suﬁered great pain of course
and one of his sisters in the party accus

«Jimmy of using brute force unnecessary.

Jimmy told her that in view of what the boys
were trying to do to him, he had no apologies
to make.

A physician was living half a mile away from
the Adams farm, and he was sent for. Of course
he found his patient in great pain and groaning
as though his life was in danger.

The young man’s sister was so wrought up that
she wasted her vocabulary of abuse on Jimmy’s
head.

The pile of corn had been about two-thirds
shucked, and one of the neighbors gave Adams
9. round scolding for having whisky at the husk-
ing for the young men present; but Adams re-
torted by‘ saying that he had always done so
all his life and had never ‘had any trouble before.

The young man whose Jaw had been dislocated
was placed in an all right condition by the

. doctor. l_ " .

“Jimmy,” said the physician, “that must have
been an ugly blow you gave that fellow.”

“I gave him the best I had in stock,” said
Jimmy.

When the crowd of young people broke up, and
Jimmy Watson led Sally Holmes out to his buggy
ﬁnd took his seat alongside of her, she said to
. im:

. “Jimmy, I was never so proud of any one in
‘_ my life as I am of you now."
~ “Thank you, Sally. That pays me for _all my
 trouble this evening, and if you will go with me
 to the next hiisking, consider yourself engaged
right now.” _ _
. , ‘‘I’ll go with you, Jimmy, to every husking in
' . the county." ' ,_
’ “Good! Good! Why not say that you will go
. .with me to all the huskings‘.7”

’  »“I will, Jimmy, if you wish me to.” ~

“I do wish it: and another thing, I wish you

would promise me to be my wife some day when _

' you take a notion to marry.” _
“Goodness rvracious! That’s worth ten thou-
sand ears of red corn,” and his arm slipped
around her waist and pressed her up to him, and
their lips met. - ‘ ’

‘meat, saying:

ﬁilio. Ifmlnot, but it is the'zirl’s business to an-

nounce the engagement herself. There will be an .
immense amount-of talk about it.” ‘

“Yes, of course,” he assented, “and the talk
has begun already. I expect to have to whip a
few more fellows on your account, too. I don’t
mind thatat all.”

“J immy, don't you do any more ﬁghting on my
account,” said_she. “If anybody asks you if We
are engaged, Just refer them to me. Don’t say
yes or _no. I want to set them to thinking and
wondering; but be sure that you come and see
me every Sunday and every Wednesday night.”

“Oh, only twice a week, eh?” ‘

“Well, I leave the other times in the week to
your discretion. You can’t neglect business on
my account.”

“Then leave Lie to be the judge as to whether ‘
or not I’m neglecting business when I’m courtin
my sweetheart.” ,

That pleased her highly and she blushed and
smiled, saying:

“Well, just come as often as you please, Jim-.
my, _and I will always be pleased to see you. .As
I said a while ago, I'm the happiest girl in the
county if not in the whole State.” 3 .

'Jimmy assisted her out of the buggy, and as he
{lid 30 he pressed her hand to his lips and

isse it.

“Well,” she ejaculated, “I really don’t believe 
you love me half as much as you say, Jimmy, if 
you are satisﬁed with kissing only my hand.” ‘ "

Without a word he threw his arms around her
neck and,‘ kissed her half a dozen times in rapid
succession. ’ ' -

“That’s the way a_man ought to kiss his sweet-
heart. Now, good—i_iight,” and with that she ran‘
into_the house, while he sprang into his buggy
and drove homeward.

“By George,”_he muttered to himself, “that's
the sort of a girl to have. There’s no foolish-.
ness about her at all. I’m sure that mother wil v.
be as proud of it as I am. and I will wake her up ' I
and tell her before I go to bed.” '

When he reached home he attended to his horse I
and buggy, locked the stable and then, in enter- ' 
mg the house, made as much noise as he possibly‘ “ ._ _
could, with the intention of awakening his ‘ "
mother. \

As he passed her door, going to his own room,
she called to him: i .

“Did you have a good time‘, Jimmy?” , ' ~,

“Yes, mother. It was a lively crowd, but we ».,I7
didn’t ﬁnish shucking all the corn.” “' ~‘

“Why, what made the boys quit before they
got through?” _

“Oh, there was a little disagreement which I
will tell you all about in the morning.” .

Then he hesitated for a few minutes trying to '
make up his mind how to announce his engage-
ment to Sally Holmes. ' ~ ’ .

Finally he hemmed and hawed and said:

“Mother, I’ve got some news for you."

Pretty As A Picture

 

One of the greatest cases in which I was ever
concerned for a few days promised to become a
celebrated, one. , .

A great jewel robbery is always a profound
attraction to the British public. One was duly
announced one morning in the very largest type,
and it had the more interest because the victim

‘was Lady Rachmore——a beautiful, young and

deservedly popular peeress.
r I and a superior oﬂicer were called in to in-

. vestigate the matter, and both were equally am-

azed to ﬁnd that the great robbery was in one
sense a very small affair indeed. ' ‘

Lady Rachmore was noted for her ﬁne pearls
and equally ﬁne diamonds, but none of those were

.missing. The young baroness, however, plainly
l . told Mr. Poynter that her distress would not have

been half so great if some of those famous jewels
had been stolen. The things abstracted from her

,jewel cases were old heirlooms of his lordship’s
‘ family, and as her husband was absent at the

time, the disaster was, of course, deemed a great-

’. er one on that account.

A list of the things showed why‘ they were

deemed of more than intrinsic value, I remem-

ber a specimen or two: -
One diamond ‘ring, the present of Alexander

V II, King of Scotland, to Hugh, Thane of Alloway
(progenitor of Lord Rachmore).

.One. uaint ring of ‘onyx, given by Louis XI
arl of Alloway, Ambassador of King

One circlet of large size, ‘the gift of Henry’
III of France to Guy, Earl of Alloway, Lieuten-
ant of the Garde l’Ecosse.

Now, all this was very perplexing to us as

 oﬁhyers. Although the pearl and diamond neck-

laces, tiaras, coronets, pendants, stars, etc., were
in the same safe, these were untouched. We had

 no common thieves. to discover-—that was per-
; fectly certain.
i run the risk of breaking in and leave behind the
' things of’ true value. I quickly concluded that
" the thieves were ‘servants, or,_ at all events, :peo-
1' pie with the privilege of residing _upon the prem-
: ‘I565. Having expressed my opinion to my com-
" rade, he laughed in his quiet way and said:

_jewels when they could place their hands on

modern things of more value in the same case-
things more‘ easily disposed of without creating

We had been standing"
in one of the windows of the back drawing-room

“during. the brief conversation recorded above, and

1 had noticed that he had been carefully “taking
«in”;the features of the house. _
Summoning the under-butler,'I desired to see

fall ‘th-.2. sei-vunts together, without causing their
suspicion of _my object. ~

As we were talking we had advanced from the

..(back window toward the first door on the left of

suddenly made a dart forward from his side, to
ﬁnd a tall, pale-faced girl, clad in a plain black-

,silk robe, in the very act of listening intently to

what had been passing between us. The expres-
sion of her face was not horror, but was certainly ‘
apprehensiveness, and, as I took mental note of ,
the whole posture, and indeed picture, I said as
if the act was the most natural and commonp ace I
in the world: »

“I really beg pardon, miss.”

Her first impulse seemed to be to scream, but
she quickly recovered herself, assuming an ex-
pression of dignity that was somewhat imposing,
pr shall I say, in my own rough way, rather
“taking” ?

Saying, “I beg yours, sir,” she turned upon
her heel deliberately and walked away in quite
a leisurely manner. :3 ~

“_I have found the thief,” I said to myself,
while I asked the ‘under-butler, carelessly: “Who ’
is that?” _ i p ' ‘

“That is Miss Challis, her 1adyship’s com-7'
paniton,” he answered, to my great disappoint-
men . . ' '

At the same instant a voice was heard below, _ _
us singing some foreign air, smartly, but not with . 
voice. On turning the carved oak balustrade we’, ~
came face to face with a most elegantly 'c‘l“a‘d
young female. I , '
fléhe under-butler, thinking of my first request,‘
sai : , »

“When will it be convenient for you to come"
downstairs to the servants’ hall, or ’the‘house-~
keeper’s -room, Mlle. Baurette?’ '

“I refuse to answer,” she returned. “I am"no' 
thief, and I decline to meet an abominable Bou-
chard even. if my lady commands it,” and she‘ '
passed on in ‘grand style, turning up her little
nose in the air. ,3 ' ~ g

“_And who may the young lady be?” I asked, not 
a little amused. ' 

“You heard-__—Mademoiselle Baurette,” he an-*-
swered. . < -A

r “Butiher position?”

“Her ladyship’s maid.”

“French?” . ' ’

“No, I fancy not. I think I have heard that her
real name is Barrett, but that her‘ people went
over‘, to Paris when she was very young, to live 7
with an English family completely settled there.” »

Of course, I saw the rest of the servants, but-
the fact is they were an unusually good and.
honest-looking lot. When I turned for form’s_-_
sake a few questions regarding the habits of the
tradesmen’s assistants, and _the custom in regard”
to the closing of the establishment, I"found..M1‘.
Poynter behind me standing beside a graves-
looking young man—I was almost saying gen-
To my intense surprise the inspector
shook hands very cordially with this individual
at the hall’ door. He seldom did this with any
one he did not wish to put‘ off his guard, so 
looked closer at the man,- and then thought there” I
was something not quite satisfactory’ about his‘, '
eyes. He was in a high good humor, so I asked‘
him who the young fellow was. i .

His name is Samuel Johnson, and he believes
himself to be the lineal descendant of an uncle

so his lordship was contented with the company

We parted that day without expressing an
So as I was
left to do as I pleased in the affair, I resolved to
watch the ladies of the establishment—-—-particular-
‘ Miss Challis, her ladyship’s companion, and
e sprightly Mlle. Baurette, the lady’s maid.._

I»soon discovered that both the youn ladies

had beaux. The one who met Miss Ch’ lis, the =

companion, was rather gentlemanly in dress and ’

appearance, and althou h they met as if by ap-

 pointment near Piccadil y, on more than one oc-
' casion he boldly called at the house and remained

inside for twenty—ﬁve minutes to half an hour
On, the second occasion I knocked after he had
one, and asking for my friend, the under—but-
er, soon learned that the young gentleman who
had just called was Mr. Spencer, late secretary
to Lord Rachmore; » I
One night I was going down to watch the front
entrance of the house when Iheard a voice that
arrested my attention_in a moment. It was that
of the little French girl... x. _ '
She was with her beau, who looked like ‘a man

, i [who wished to hide his identity. ’

I ‘fAnd" you love me very, very truly?” .

.“.Dearly. You are to me dearer than life,” re-
turned the man, in the jolliest manner.

“Ah, you are good,” she went on; “very good,
even if you are poor. Never mind, you will pay
me all back when we are married. To-night I
also am poor, but here is a little gem upon which
you can raise money.” '

Then thegate was opened and closed, the man
returned in the same way he had come, and I,
‘lurking in the shadows, followed him, conﬁdent

~ that he carried one of the missing jewels in his

pocket. .
I Walking ‘rapidly, he crossed Piccadilly, and
while he was still- within easy distance of me, a
st:-ing.«of~ carriages dividedus. I saw him dash
downby St. James’ Church, but when the car-
riages" had passed’, he got so far ahead. that I
‘could notovertake him until hehad disappeared
into one of two doors in King street. -
He was watched all night, and his house kept
under close surveillance till'the morning. Then
‘I followed him to a well-known pawnbroker’s in
the neighborhood. I went in front, and drew
the assistant’s attention while he was examining.
the ring. I was, of course, unseen, and asked if
that gentleman had ever left anything there be-

against the lady's will I took Mlle. Baurette

When Spencer came before the magistra

little thing. - ' V -

Spencer got two year's imprisonment.

Nearly three years after I was called into a!
house in Paddington to arrest a girl for stealing
a gold chain. M surprise. may be imagined when’

I recognized Ml e. Baurette, now as plain Miss» ,
Barrett. I would not arrest her, however, until’-* V‘
I had seen Mr. Poynter, who was not at all sat-is-‘
ﬁed by the affair. Leaving the house, I foundi. ,
the girl’s former accomplice in crime lurking: I
about the place. 1

My scruples vanished. I arrestedhim and the! i *
girl. In due time they were committed for trial,-..  ’
and the trial came on. Spencer was sentenced td
penal servitude for ﬁve years, and Miss Barrett?
to twelve month's ‘imprisonment.

PET RACCOON FLEES TO SAFETY

A raccoon, which has been leading a strenuous
urban existence as a pet of Miss Laura B-. Gar-
rett, educator and naturalist, of No. 3941 Caro-
line Street, Sunnyside Gardens,,Long Island City,
making trips about the country in Pullmans, rid-
ing in subways and what not, rew tired of it
all recently and hidaway in a ole in the attic
ﬂloor for what seems likely to be a long winter
s eep. .

Nothing which Miss Garrett has tried ;to lure
Mr. Raccoon from the bliss of deep oblivion, safe
from the hum of traffic, has succeeded. Choice
morsels of food remain untouched at the opening
of the hole, which a carpenter, who was repairing
the ﬂoor, neglected to cover. ,

Miss Garrett added the raccoon some time ago
to an assortment of pets that included an eight-
foot gopher snake, ‘a lizard, turtles, snails and
pigeons. She has transported the whole family ’
as far as Chicago in a. Pullman car on a lecture
trip. Recently the raccoon was treated to a ride
in the subway. He created‘ a commotion by
reaching out and pinching the leg of the woman
who sat next.

‘Miss Garrett is undecided whether to leave the
raccoon to quiet slumber or rip up the floor and‘

~ take him back to its barrel shelter in thecellaif.
