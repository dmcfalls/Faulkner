Moreover, the persons who seemed to be doing the
tr‘ailing———Nick ﬁgured that there were three of them-,-
excited the detectives interest. They were Japanese, and
this fact, coupled with the call he had received at the
Senate from the man, Mustushimi, wasthe ﬁrst circum-
stance that had come to Nick Carter’s hands that might

A be regarded as a possible clue ‘to the mysteries he was
,_ trying to solve. He recalled now, that at least two of
the incidents that had been related to him, one by the
President and one by the senator, where spies had been
at ‘work, had to do with an ambassador to the United
 States, and that in both cases that ambassador had rep-

resented the Eastern Empire, which has lately become so i

~ , important a factor in diplomatic affairs. For a moment,
‘ while the detective stood there in front of the Hotel
Raleigh, he believed that he saw the first part of the
solution of his problem clearly outlined, forit was ex-
actlyin keeping with the known cliaracteristics of the
 Japanese people that they should ‘resort to ’a SPY systein
’ for their inside information, and who,‘ among all the

It was a plot against the statesman'.on_’ly, 'in..the.abstract,

ba~uch_his position and misuse ,_his_p_(_),_wers an_d _abili_ti_es.

the same spies vhadwtaken in the movements and conversa-
_tl011S«0,fAtl'le Pres_ide_nt him,s_elf.__ _ I,  - ,_ ‘, .
c And so, as Nick thought the matter over, he presently
1 determined in his own mind that it would be far better
‘for the‘ interests of all concerned if he" should neglectathe
appointment he had made with the President and seek no
further interview with the Chief Executive; at least,

matters than he was now aware of.

' Wlicen he arrived at the sena_tor’s rooms, as ‘already de-.
scriberl, he found himself confronted by a new dilemma
in the person of the senator’s private secretary, a young
man, who’ came to thetdpor to admit him when he arrived.
Plainly this young cliapsliould be gotten rid of at once,

that was being played, and 50, passing into t_he.«senator’s
study, he dictated rapidlya letter to Nick Carter in New
"York—~that is, tp l1imself——knowing that Chick would
laccept and read it when it arrived there; and that done, he
‘directed the young, man to board the evening train and ‘
. to d/eliveif the letter in person,c_,telling him at the same time
' that there would be no answer, but that he might amuse
‘himself for aday or twoin New York ~ City, it he cared”
to do so. '/ C‘ .   - C C
V. He had: the satisfaction presently of seeing the young
man depart, and of knowing that ow he had the sena-
tor’s'aparhnent to himself; and"th‘en recurred toihirn the
\'question of his appointment‘ with the] President. It was
now evening, and lacked but a few hours of the time when
"he should appear at the'White‘H'ouse‘, and he Jgnew the
_fPl‘eSld€11t well enough to be aware that he"was a stickler
’fQ‘1- app intments, and that he w‘bqld be expected toarrive’
‘there’ promptly at the time Set fo?’fthe interview. 4’ .

their joint burden was a rudely fashioned stretcher, on
which something was lying,‘covered by an overcoat.

The discovery ﬁlled me with dismay. I asked myself

hour of the night. I Not being able to give a satisfactory
explanation, Iremained out: of sight to await further
‘developments. V A ‘ A A ‘

me, and for the first time I found a cold sweat standing;
out upon my forehead. I had seen two. men, rnurrlerers,-,
dispose of the corpse of their victim, in the lonely woods _
NV ho their victim was was a mystery to me. His name“ .
had not been mentioned. But the names of his assassins, 
Hardy and Pete, with the features of each, I knew, and i I
could well remember, for the whole of the horrible scene I
was burnt upon my memory.  V  , .
For a moment I was perplexed and bewildered, not
knowing what to do. My first thought was to uncover,
the body, and drag it to the road, then return to Carson!
and inform the police. But this I rejected, for might not
the police justice or coroner inquire why I had done so
and if I could not give a satisfactory answer, put me
under suspicion?‘ . . a
The cold sweat started anew at the bare thought, and V
the fear took such a strong hold upon me that I ﬂed frcini ,"

open road. - ‘ A I »

myself thatlquestion, and ﬁnally decided tovreturn to

situated on a side street. I was lucky to ﬁnd the Cl1l‘e_f>il‘1-
