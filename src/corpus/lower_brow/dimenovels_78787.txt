CHAPTER I.

A PRINCE AND’ AN IMPOSTQRQ

 "Nick Carter gazed in amazement at the card which 7
‘Joseph handed to ,him, for. he read upon it the name _
r‘oj£_"Vthe man whom only yesterday he had succeeded in

:;~ia{Er'esting after one of the most puzzlingicases of his

and that there had been more than one
for the decision will presently appear.

The name scrawled upon the card was “Sindahr in

Goosh”-—a name which the reader will at once recog-

nize as belonging to that part of the world which lies M
in the mountainous region at the northern extremity__'
of India; but the name by whieh;;.Nick Carter knew the
,man, and by which, without the”di'7sguise, he wasknown —
in‘ “high” society in the city ofi_New York, was no ,«

less than “Prince Edouard Thiers-Danton.” ' ~ -'

As the prince; as a descendant of royalty, this man Vi
had suddenly appear_ed'in. New York.society, taking it ' ‘ .
by storm; for the “_Srnart4Set’V’ybf the metropolis dearly . ‘N
loves a prince, and had not hesitated.to accept him as '

such. ; J

till after midnight——t0 be exact, twelve—forty—ﬁve.

’Danton has retired, and after posting this in the box
in the hall, I shall do the same.”

Chick’s report was merely a recapitulation of Patsy’s
with the inside information “eliminated. He merely
told to what places Danton had gone during the day,
and the time of his arrival back home; but he added,
at the end:

“I have not seen the valet to—day. He had not

come out of the house at all at the time I was called

away to follow Patsy and Danton. So far as I know,
he is now (I a. m.), inside the house and has not left
it to-day, but, of course, he might have been out all
day without my being any the wiser. I have an un-

. . easy feeling about me that I should be watching him

instead of Danton; but you know best.”

The detective retired with considerable to think

. over, but_ soon fell asleep and so forgot all about the

case.

In the morning, as on the previous day, he was
startled by reading in the paper the following head-
line: “Acton Oakes, Clitbrnan, Killed.”

After that the article went on to state that Acton

, Oakes, who was an exceedingly popular.man in his

own set, had been’ run down and killed by an automo-,

«bile when in_ the act of crossing Fifth Avenue above‘

l

Thirty-fourth Street.
The article explained thatVMr. Oakes was hurrying
across the avenue ‘when the car, which was moving

rapidly, struck him, hurlingihim many feet, and so

throwing him beneath the wheels of a second car that’
was traveling in‘ the opposite direction.

It was not known which car had actually killed him,

The man who had been driving the car that ﬁrst
struck him disappeared at on,ce,_,and no trace of ‘him
could be found. He left his car ‘there in the middle
of the street while the_crowd was gathering around

 the victim——just abandoned it.
A ’  The car was afterward discovered to be a hired .
i , one, and, at the garage where it belonged, no informa—-

tion could be obtained regarding the man who had

_,  hired it.., He was describedias a man with sandy hair
i 7:"_ *who~gave the name of Michaellguinn, and had left a
,,f§ deposit of two hundred and ﬁfty‘ dollars, which had’
‘ ‘not been called for. . . ‘ .

NEW NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

It is supposed that he was so_rattled by theiaccident‘ I V

that he preferred to lose his two hundred and ﬁfty,

to the unpleasantness attached to what had occurred} V

“This is most remarkable,” mused the detective.
“Here are two of the witnesses against Danton ‘dead
within a little more than twenty-four hours of each
other. They are strange coincidents, to say the least. f

“But, all the same,” he mused further presently,

“there does not appear to be anything in ei-ther of them"I .

that could possibly connect Danton with them. ‘It
seems absurd even to suppose so. Mrs. Haldeen fell
or leaped from the window of one of her rooms, and
Oakes was run down in the street by an automobile,
hurled under another one, and so killed. , V _
“There seems,‘however, to be a fatality following
those witnesses, and I think after a little I will go and
call upon Professor Ball and warn him to be careful.”

It was rroon when the detective_rang the bell of the‘— V

house where the professor lived, and he was informed
that the scientist was at work in his laboratory and
never permitted himself to be disturbed at such times. 7

,than itsipredecessor, he turnedito the footman, who

had followed him to the top ﬂoor, and asked:
“Have you a. key to thislroom P” i
i.“No, sir. The professor never permitted the key

~ Nick spentia few moments in examining the lock,
and discovered that it was so complicated that he could
not hope to pick it. i ’ A i *
‘ Then he sent for some tools which the footmanysaid
_were in the house, and set himself to work to force
; his way into the room, ‘having previously called _aloud

‘gazed upon the scene in consternation.

Nick wondered if the professor had been engaged in

7 the discovery of some new explosive, which had gone

off accidentally, for he could account for the situation

'in no other way. .

He examined the ‘body again, and discovered that

» in addition to what he had noticed in the ﬁrst place,

it -was covered with bruises and abrasions.
The coat had been almost entirely blown away.
The waistcoat was torn to ribbons.. The shirt was in

strips and covered with blood. One of the trousers

On the head, above the right temple, was a terrible

if .; bruise, and it looked as if the skull beneath it had

been ‘fractured, as indeed proved to be the case.
Nick examined the half of the graduateithat was
still retained in the hand of the dead man, and saw
that it still contained the sediment of a liquid; then
he gave some attention to the broken glass around
the body‘. '

_ ‘ Near it, on the roof outside, he discovered some par-
ticles of broken glass which had doubtless been hurled
there by the force of,‘ the explosion.

The skylight had been made in the shape of an in-
verted V and raised from either side toward the center.

Both these sides were open, at about right angles with

the highest point, or, rather, on a level with it.

And Nick did ﬁnd him there, laid ‘out on one of
the slabs and awaiting identiﬁcation. ‘ t
It was unmistakably J. AD. Prime. The body had
been found that morning, at the end of one of the
piers where the clothing had caught upon a projecting
_ nail in’ a’ spile and so kept the body afloat, and also
, prevented it from" drifting out with the tide. V i
‘There was not a single market violence upon the
body anywhere. Apparently, nothing had been taken
from thepockets. \ , . i M
Prime’s money, diamonds, and watch had been
. found intact, only, strangely enough, there was noth-
ing about him bywhich he could be identiﬁed, save
that his three initials were engraved inside the case
 of his watch. p ‘ ‘ / .
. it w ' “Evidently,” thought the detective, “Manan Dreehm
i _ . took time enough td remove the means of immediate
‘ , identiﬁcation from 'Prime’s' clothing before he shoved
 hirninto the river to drown andto ﬂoat out to sea,
7 _ as he would have done but for the accident that the
3 clothing caught on a nail at one of‘ the pier-heads.”
But the fourth witness against Sinclahr Goosh, or

and, therefore, could !not testify against]him.'

 V This time, however, there was something to be ob-
- tainécl in the way of explanation concerning how the
.rnTan_¢.had‘beenp killed. . y t ’
 eThfere was no doubt in the_ mind .o=f_the detective
that Primehad ﬁrst been drugged by Manan, butnot
.sufﬁ_cient1y to: prevent him from staggering along if
" «bet were partly supported. After that he had been led
by easy stages’ toward the river, and, doubtless before
he was pushedinto it,.anoth'er.dose hadgbeen adminis-
.:tere_cl to him, to kill him. I ,
 'Nick'went towthe superintendent’ of the gruesome
placed and niadeillthe necessary identiﬁcation; he ar-
‘franged also that ‘a .post mortem should be held/ to de-
ftermine exactlyitwhat had killed the man———that/ is,
"whether he had‘_really been drowned, or if he. had died.

The answer was a positive negative,2and Nick passed
on to the adjoining house, while Mr. Morgan took the
one next to that.

Inthis manner they worked their way along the
block for a considerable distance, when, as Nick was

_X turning away from another ‘positive negative, Morgan
A called to him from the next stoop.

“Come here, Carter,” he said. “I have found the
house at last.” « ,

g It was the gentleman who owned the house who re-
plied to‘the questions. V

4 ’ I‘‘Yes,’’ he said; “There was such a request made
of me yesterday."
‘ “Did you grant it P" asked Nick.

“Yes. I hesitated to do so at first, but he showed

his badge, and:” I I
‘i “What sort of badge was it P”
“The telephone company.”
“So you admitted him ?” ,_
, “Yes.” i i

“What then?”

“I went with him to the scuttle. I informed him,
when I let him out upon the roof, that I should hook

, it ﬁter him, and that when he was ready to descend,
if he would rap upon it with one of his tools, some-
7 . body would come to let him down ,again.”
‘ ' “Well?” , _
“He replied that he should be engaged about half
an hour, thanked me, and disappeared. I locked the
scuttle-—that is, hooked it—.——and descended the stairs
again.”
,“Was he a red-haired man?”
“Yes.”
“With dark eyes? Did you notice?”
“Yes. I did notice that he had unusually dark eyes
for one whose hair was red.”
‘.‘‘Did it occur to you that the hair might be a wig ?°’
 “No; it did not._”« I '
I" .‘g‘What time was he here?”
 I-;"“Ai little before two, if I remember correctly.”

I “I think you do. Did he have anything in particular
to say to you?” « _

‘ “Nothing only what he would naturally say in pre-
ferring such a request as he made.” .

. L “Did he return to the street through your house?”
I. .uY*eSrn_ .“ . _ , I

,'greatly obliged.” I , . I
V ‘I H “Did you let him out of the house yourself?”
1 “YeS.97
_'»‘‘Of course you had never seen the ‘man before?”
, . Nick asked this question without expecting an afﬁrma-
' f ’ tive”rep1y, and was greatly astonished when he re-
ceived one. , I [ I . p, ‘ I
»:‘Oddly enough, I had seen him before, Mr. Carter.

“I saw him passing the house about eleven‘ o’clock I’
yesterday morning, only he was not at" th_at»titnef‘
dressed as if_he were a lineman; If Ithad‘recogniz'ed 
him as that man, when he ﬁrst applied here, I would .4
not have admitted him.” "  . 3“
“He was on his way to make a call at that time,’
said the _-detectiwe. “The question is, if you[should.‘,..~
see that man again, would you be able to identify;
him?” i » "
“I most certainly would be.” I , V "
“Did you notice anything that he carried‘ with him“
to the roof, other than his tools?” I I I ‘ '
“Yes; one thing. I even asked him What it was.
“What was it ?”. v ' j
“A bottle. I asked him what it contained, for if:
struck methat he handled it with extreme care.” ’
“What was his reply to that question?” i  I .
“He said it was glycerin, for lubrication. ‘ He
said that frequently it was necessary to do some drill _
ing and oil was necessary in such a case, and that.he~C
used glycerin because it did not leave a black smudge
anywhere. I thought it a very reasonable answer, and 1
said no more about .it.” . 4 I ‘I I
“It was glycerin, sir; nitroglycerin.”
“Good Heaven 1” . A
“VVill you permit me to venture upon yourvroof
also?” asked Nick. I f ' 
“Certainly. I should warn you, however, to be care-
ful. My roof is made of a combination of tarIand_‘
gravel. I ﬁnd it cooler than a tin roof in summer‘. I
think the gravel must be worn awayvor displaced”;
some place, for when that man came down he tracked
it into the house. I did not discover it till later.’’ ,\

The imprint was the perfect outline of the sole_’of'.i1

and had evidently stuck there, and was doubtless Wham

But the rest of the.imprint was perfect. 
It showed where under the ball of the foot, next,
to the little toe, a portion of the sole thadbeen worn;
away, and here the marks of the threads with which
the shoe had been sewed had left their imprint.“ ‘  "
More than that, there was »a ‘curious marking So-’,t'
four nails in the middle of the sole ofthe shoe; it Was,

 if theshoes had squeaked, and their owner had
aken that method of stopping the annoyance.

The position of these nails was like this: - I -

The toe of the imprint’ pointed "toward the house
where the professor had been killed,- and Nick walked
“on over the roofs. stopping now and then to use a

agnifying-glass and to study something that, he

 These were stains of tar; just spots which the glass

CHAPTER XII. -
" THE THREE THINGS Nacsssnnv.

__,‘.‘I[Th,ere are now three things that'I must ﬁnd with
he least possible delay,” the detective told himself
fter taking leave of Mr. Morgan and starting along
he street again. . V I I i e ‘ '
, Hevfelt that he had accomplished a great deal al-
eadyl, but there was still much todo. e i_ r_ .
Atpthe risk of offending the man who laad permitted
hem to pass through his house to the roof, he had cut
uteand carefully wrapped up‘a square of the tarred
-‘roof which contained the imprint.of the murderer’s

_When he passed through the house on his way out,
eytold'what he, had done, and added: , .
""I will telephone at once for an expert roofer I

The gentleman smiled and replied: .

He walked on a ‘considerable distance farther, and
then suddenly turned his steps toward the house where
Prince Edouard had had his apartments.

“Patsy said they were already in process of dis— I

mantlement,” he said to himself, “but all the same I
think I’ll take a look-in there. It may not be without
result.”

He saw,‘ when he left the elevator, that the doors A

of the apartment were open, and, as he crossed the
threshold, he ’came suddenly face to face with Danton

himself, who was in the act of turning toward the _'

door, probably to take his departure.
The man stopped in his tracks and smiled.

“I was just going to your house,” he said mildly. ,’

T ‘Without undue haste he deposited it in his Phcket;
and then he began an examination of the articles that
remained. T A
In this he was more than fortunate, ‘for presently he
discovered a chauffeur’s mask‘ and cap; next he uncov-
, ered a suit of clothing that had several times been de-
scribed to him as worn by the man with the red hair;
and then———greatest discovery of all—a pair of old
and much—worn shoes. -
They were the shoes, too. He knew that.
The right one had four nails in the sole, driven

_ there in such positions that a line drawn around them

would have comprehended a perfect diamond in shape;
and at the base of the heel of that same shoe the stain
of the tar, in which the man had trod, could still be
seen.

<The shoes had been wrapped in paper before they
were deposited in the trunk, and, as the detective’
started to make use of it again for the same purpose,
he was startled to discover,’ printed in large letters,
the ﬁrm name of “Coke & Vl/inﬁeld, Fifth Avenue.”
Then he looked farther, and in another place on the

' paper found written the name and address of Mrs.

Haldeen. It was the very paper that had covered
the parcel that the red—headed man had taken to the
Calathumpian to deliver to her. ‘

The detective felt that these things supplied all the
evidence he needed, and he wrapped them together
hastily, using some old newspapers to enclose them,
and then, with the bundle beneath his arm, let himself
quietly out at the rear door, made his way to the
elevator, and so out of the house.

He had taken care to leave things in the trunk as
nearly as possible as he found them,‘ although, of
course, the wig was not there on top; but he had to
take his chances as to that. ‘

“I’ve got the wig and the shoes; now for the man,”
he told ‘himself, as he went out upon the street. _

In order to r-id himself of the bundle and still know
that it was safe, he went directly to his own house,
arriving there twenty minutes later; and, as he ran

_ up the steps toward the front door, it opened, and

Danton, in the proper attire for Sindahr Goosh, came
out. i D

- “Ah!”.the fellow exclaimed as soon as he saw the
detective. “It seems that you are here. Will you
permit yourself to be seen, Mr. Carter?” he added

' ironically.

Without waiting! for a reply he stepped back again
through the. door into the house, Nick following, and,

J as he did‘ so;0the detective saw the ﬁgure of Manan
_,Dreehm pass through the door that opened into the
reception~room.

. “Go in there,” said Nick to Danton, and as if he

,_ had ‘not seen the other man; and he followed them
. lbpthmthrough the doorway and closed it after him.

.,He had tossed the bundle into the hands of Joseph,

_  ‘inthe hall,’ as he entered the house, with the warning, ,
 g ,“Take good care of that, Joseph.” '

Now, as he closed the door \Qf the room behind him
and found that both the men were facing him, he took
one quick step forward, and then, without the least‘ ,
warning, he struck out with all the strength he  
command. ‘ . H V T

The blow landed exactly where he had irls‘-iendedit
should; that is, on the point of the chin of Manan
Dreehm, and that individual shot into the air ‘back-'
ward and then collapsed on the ﬂoor as if he had been
hit by.a bullet. V l _ ,7 ‘

“What the devil do you mean, you ” cried 
Danton; but he got no further than that, for a second“.-.
blow, this time a left—hander, caught him under the
ear, and he followed the example of his servant; and,
both men remained where they fell. V J H , 5 _f,

“I’ll teach you fellows to get fresh with Nick Car-
ter!” smiled the detective, as he looked down upon’
them. Then he stepped to the door and called Joseph."

“Telephone to headquarters that I’ve got two men
here whom I wish to have taken directly there, and not;

 
   
  
  
 

 

l

to the station—house,” he said. , _ , ,.

He neturned to the room then where he had left the‘ 
men and busied himself in putting the irons onthem; fl
and he had , just completed the job and stood erect, 2,7,
when the door opened and Patsy came into the hall. D ‘

“I have found him!” he exclaimed. “I have found,
Chick. He is at the New York Hospital with a lump‘ ,,
on his head-the size of a ‘baseball. He got it last ,;,:
night, in the street, when he was following us home
from -Madam Savage’s; and he must have been taken
in a cab after that, and thrown into the river, for he
came to himself in the water, yelled to a couple of .
junkmen who were passing in a boat, and got them
to help him out. He hasn't the least idea who ‘hit’: «i
him, though.” i l  it

[Next moment a tall, powerful man appeared, leading

Oxford. Jack Barﬁeltl, his chum, was spending the holi-

days with him, and would accompany him to the uni—'

versity. Sir Fergus, who had not visited his old home
since his wife’s death, ﬁve years ago, traveled with the
boys to Dublin, but there received news which impelled
him to remain, Desmond-and Jack going on alone, their

T places on the coach having been booked. Sir Fergus, how-
- ever, was in hope of being able to join his son in a few

days. , . .

V Mr. Peter Marney, who managed the Nolan estates, had
received the two boys in a way that struck Jack Barﬁeld,
who was of a more observant nature than his friend, as
not wholly sincere. Hence the remark of his which opens

, this story.

It was the day after their arrival, and the chums were

having an afternoon canter. Desmond’s horse was a bit

fresh, and needed careful handling, though the boy was
inclined to let the animal have its ﬂing.‘ Eventually he
leftjack far behind. V ' ‘ F .

1- Suddenly, as ifefrom the ground, a shambling, shock-
headed ﬁgure sprang into view. The swift-rushing steed

 threw.up its head at the sight, and, swerving. aside,

‘stretched its neck and tore madly away. ,
“Bolting’s your game,‘ is it?” muttered Desmond.
Holding on with hands and knees,'he tried all he knew

,V to. stop the I‘unaway—-to no purpose.
' \ “How would it end?” was the thought that ﬂashed
. through his mind. ' ' ’

Desmond gave a swift look round to see if Jack was in_
sight. He was not.  . i V
Just’ ahead stood a wall of more than usual height. Up

‘and forward they leaped——hor_se and rider. Then a crash

-——a fall—a heavy thud, and——darkness.
Some miles from Castle Nolan, among rugged hills,
It was little

standing bearing many signs ‘of bygone conﬂicts.

,In this gloomy place several men gathered one night.
A few candles illumined the cheerless interior, and shone
upon the dark, lowering faces of the company.

“What keeps Arty O’Connor ?” asked one of aﬁotlier:

"Hark! that’s his step. He has some one with him——a
