Biff! His arm shot out and his h-ardﬁst landed

. , on Moses’ nose ,' a force that sent the oung

1* ruﬁian reeling b from Ruby and started the

blood ﬂowing. The newcomer followed up his at-

tack with a hook in the bully’s jaw that made his

' . teeth rattle like castanets. Then a third blow

. straight from the shoulder caught young Kattcher

 " on the mouth, cutting his lip and sending him
' " down on his back on the rocks.

“Had enough, you coward?” demanded the pugi-
listic young chap, standing over Moses with Ham-
ing eyes and heaving chest.

Evidently Moses had had all he wanted of that
kind ofexercilse, though he didn't say so, for he

. made no attempt to get upand get back at his ag-

, i , «igressor, nothwithstanding that he had the advan—

. tage in physique. Seeing that he had conquered
the coward the newcomer turned to the girl.

. “Tom Rockwood.” she exclaimed, her eyes danc-

ing with satisfaction, “I’m so glad you came up to

«stop him.” '

“I’m glad myself. I was just pulling my boat

into the cove below when I heard your ﬁrst
 scream. I knew something was the matter,» so I
 » hurried up to see what was going on. I’ve been
I « ‘, ‘ itching for a chance to put it over Moses Kattcher
I .for the way he treats you. Now he's got a taste of
what’s‘comi'ng to him if he doesn’t keep his hands

off you in the future.”

“I’ll git square with yer, Tom‘ Rockwood," snarl-

’ ed Moses, as he picked himself up. ,
. ' “Will you? Well. now is as good as any time for
~.‘  -you_ to do it,” replied Tom deﬁantly.
, " “Yah! I hate yer. I’d jest as lief kill yer if I
“ I  ‘got the chance,” replied the bully vindictively.
 “I dare say you’d like to, but you haven’t the
’ courage to tijyit on.” _ ‘
‘, ‘_,‘I’ll ﬁx yer yet. see if.I don’t,” growled Moses
with a vicious glare at.Tom.
 ,“Bah! A barking ‘cur ,never bites,” gretorted
 Rockwood. “Better go home. You're not wanted
I‘ here- If 'I hear of you touching Ruby Rand again
. I'll give _you a whaling you’ll remember for a
' month."_ ,. ' .. .
, I “Wait till my old man ketches, yei‘. He'll knock
the stuﬁin’ out of yer." ‘ ~
‘ " “I know you're coward enough to want him t
y ,, ﬁght yogi‘ battles for you; but I bet he isn't such
 a fool.” .. . ‘
* . Moses scowlede and moved away, a short dis-
’ tance. Then he stooped, picked up a stone and
‘ shied at Tom's head, It whizzed within an inch*of
"Rockwood’s ear. Tom immediately sprang after

 

 
 
  

 

the bully. Moses took to his heels. at once and '

» ‘f/t".ﬂew over the rocks as /fast as he could.go. Tom
’ chased him some distance. and seeing that he
’ couldn't overtake him he returned to Ruby and
_ ~ the two walked down the rocks to where,Tom had
“ drawn his boat up in the cove. _

“Yes. the ﬁsh ran good this morning" "

The town Tom referred to was called Eas-tl,ake,.
and lay three miles inland from Gosport. ‘It was:
not a large place. but it had a ﬁsh-curing estab
lishment and some other industries, and’ wast
terminus of a branch line of railroad. ‘
“See what I brought you Tom,” said the little
maid, unwrapping her package and exposing;
small fruit pic. ‘‘I made that expressly ‘for you,
and I bought the fruit with some of the money yo‘
gave me the other day.” .

busy at the stove. Nat ate at the cabin more than
half the time. which fact was so well known to his
father that his absence from the lighthouse dur-
ing mealtimes never occasioned any remark. '

“He’s safe enough,” said Kattcher, striking a’

_ out if he took a notion to do so.”

— Peter Fawls’ suggestion was carried out, and

 the unconscious Tom was triced up by Kattcher
’ in_a dark hole under the circular iron staircase.‘

The two men resumed their drinking, srpoking
‘and conversation at the table, while the’ gale
' shrieked without like a myrid of lost souls ‘from
_ the infernal regions.” At length Fawls, after a
glance at the clock on a shelf in the room, got up

‘ and said: . ’ »

_ , “It wants a quarter of/twelve. The ‘Windy
eCity’ is due off this vicinity inside of half an
hour if the storm hasn’t delayed her. If it was

“clear weather she’d be in sight now, I should
judge. The oﬂicers are, no doubt, keeping a
sharp lookout for the light, and not seeing_ it, they
will‘ suppose that the steamer is still miles to

spite of the fact that the light is out; but if the

captain thinks he’s still somewhere in the neigh-

, borhooi of the South Shoals, and hugs the inner

_ passage, wich is his regular course, he’ll,stand a
good chance of going slap on the reefs out yondg.

Then the‘ vessel will be our meat. We’d bet 1‘

get up on the-gallery now, and you must keep a

sharp lookout with the night-glass. You ought

to be able to tell if she goes on the rocks.”

“They’ll send up rockets,’ if they do, as signals
, tofthe coast-guard.”

1 1 ‘,“But it will be too late to save the steamer,

then, eh?"

—v , “Nothin’ under heaven can save her if she rests
her ribs on the ’Shark’s Teeth,” replied Kattcher
. emphatically. ' . V
i L “Good?” -chuckled the lawyer. “The boats of
V, the coast-guard will t'ake the passengers oif, and

that's the best they can do, eh?"

“If they save a third of them in such a sea as

;is, frothin' . around the Teeth tonight, if. the
steamer goes on the reefs, they'll be doin' well.”

, “Well, we’ve all got to die, some time-—ev“en on
and I, Kattcher, when our time comes. T ey
 drowning ‘is an easy death.” '

~ , “That's a matter of taste," growled the ﬁsher‘-

man. ' v

“Yes, both bolts are shot.” ‘ V

'l'.}he two villainous plotters started up the stair-
way, their boots echoing on the iron steps‘; but
this sound was soon swallowed up in the uproar
-of the tempest. Hardly had they left the ‘lower
ifoom before Tom ’RockW,oo,d regained hissenses.»
’_He [found himself gagged and bound to the iron

h~is_aid insofar that he remembered what had
V ccurred before the lighthouse door was opened,
andwhat had happened to him immediately after.

Fawls.' , . _ "

“That can soon be proved,” said Kattcher. .A .

Tom and N at heard every word they said. Both — -
recﬁnized Batt’s voice, and_had no doubts about _. "
his identity. : .

“They'll look in here’ in »a moment,” whispered
Tom. “We must rush on them and take them by ’

yozncan, anbthen we'll make for the door and "get!

Tom and Nat crouched down, and the moment "
Kattcher appeared in the opening they sprang‘ ,
at him like a couple of cats. ' ‘he young ﬁsherman -— 
landed a heavy blow,on his mouth, while Nat 
punched him in the stomach with all his strength. ' ” 
Big and strong as Kattcher was, he went down 
under the suddenness and impetus of the attack, "
uttering a loud imprecation. The boys rushed out"
and encountered the lawyer. They bowled him
over with little diﬂiculty, for he, too, was taken. .
Then they darted for the door..
Nat drew’ the bolts in a twinkling. _ _ 

“Stop them!” roared Batt, springing to his
feet and making a rush for the boys. — .

He was just a moment too late tostop them.. “
They dashed out into the storm. The ‘boys dis-
appeared in the darkness, with Kattcher and.
Peter Fawls close at their heels. The lantern o
the light was still dark, but the Shark’s Teet
reef was lit up with a dazzling bluish light, burn-
ing on the _forecast'le of the wrecked steamer, .. .
“ indy City,” which 1ay~in the midst of the boil-'‘, __
ing caldron of seething water. ,At intervals 
rockets were discharged from thebridge of the
ill-fated craft to attract the 1ife~saving crew--to‘
the spot. Kattcher and Fawls occasionally ‘ .
caught sight of the _ﬂeeing‘_ lads and were thus
able to keep on their track, but the boys reached »
'_I‘om’s cabin ahead of them and locked themselves 
m. . -  I

The tworascals sat. down under the lee of the
building and watched the wreck whenever a red
f’l1ght or a. blue one was set off. Tom and Nat
watched, the wreck, too, from "the ‘window over-»
looking the sea; _ . _ ,. .;

“Th'ere’ll be trouble to burn over this night’s
work,” said Tom. , . .

5‘I_'m thinking there _'will,” replied Nat in an.-
anxious tone. “Dad will be up against it hard.” s

“It isn’t his fault." Batt Kattcheihandr the
other chap are responsible for the wreck of the
steamer. Our evidence will count in your father’s
favor,” said —Tom. V p V ;

“What could be their object in putting outthe
light?” asked Nat. ~ _ H L

“To lure some vessel on the Shark’s Teeth,‘ I‘
suppose”. ' 1 ,.

“And what good will that do them?” ’ l ' 1'

“That’s as much of a conundrum "to _me as

“I"]‘1VVhy”y0u young liar!"’ roared the ﬁsherman.

,As he startedeto spring-at Tomithe lawyer ‘ ‘
caught him by the arm and said: . '

“There's a crowd of men coming with lanterns. ‘
We’ll have to get away if we want to avoid
trouble.” ‘ .

Kattcher turned around and looked back.‘
Quite a number of men from the village, with
lights, were coming down the rocks a few hun-
dred yards away. With an imprecation he made
a dash at Tom ~-and tried to snatch the belt, -to
which the b%y‘ had returned the paper, out of
liis hands. e young ﬁsherman met him wi
a swing of is "stick, and the blow landed 0 . . .
Kattcher’s shoulder. ' He was aboutto attack Tom _-
again when Fawls dragged him away. 7 ‘

“Don’t act the fool," whispered the lawyer.
“Come away. We know this boy has the paper.
We’ll watch him and get itfrom him when-he’s
off his guard.” V

Reluctantly the ﬁsherman gave up’ further ‘iv:

efforts to get hold of the important paper, and,

following his companion, both hurried away in
the gloom of the night. _ ~
The party of fishermen whom the report of the 
wreck on the Shark’s Teeth had brought from  T
the village dividedgat’ the headland when it was
seen that the lantern in the lighthouse was dark, . V .-
part going'to the tower to ﬁnd out why the light

to the beach. It was the latter bunch that had
frightened oﬂ’ Kattcher and the rascally lawyer. . .-
When they came up to where Tom and Nat . ._
were standing near the dead sailor they stopped _ ‘
to look at the corpse, and to ask if the man had “:3:
come ashore alive andudied afterward. As soon 

‘as the ﬁshermen recognized Nat they began ‘ply-

ing him with questions about the light.
“How came the light to go out, Nat?” asked
one. "It was burnip’ all right when I turned -in.” ‘i
“The lamps were put out by a couple of villains
who entered the lighthouse early tonight, sur-
prised m _dad,‘ and done him and Jud Wicker. up,
after loc ng me up in the cellar. ' I’d have been
there yet if it hadn’t been for Tom Rockwood,
who came over to the lighthouse to see what was
the matter with the light and let me out.” ~ , '
“The lamps put out by a couple of villains!”
exclaimed the crowd in astonishment. “Who I
were they?” " » r ”
“One was Batt Kattcher, and the other was 3” ‘
man named Peter Fawls,” said Tom.
‘ “Do you,mean to say that Batt Kattcheixhelped = .
to put the lamps out?” asked one of the ﬁshermen.
“I do. -Nat and me both saw him in the light-~
house, where he had no right to be, after the ,
light was out.”. ‘ ~ ' F . " “~ .
A murmur of surprise and anger rose from '
the bunch of ﬁshermen. ‘Batt Kattcher,\:t'or. vari-,

 ” ished,' no one had any doubt of .Kattcher’s guilt.
’ i While the foregoing events ‘were happening on
the beach the coast,-guard‘ lifeboat had been res-
cuing the crew and passengers of the steamer
"Windy City” and taking them into Gosport Inlet,
where they were landed at the solitary wharf

and taken charge of by the villagers, who did

' all that was in their power for the unfortunates.

By the time the last man had been taken off

the wreck, day was breaking. The gale had

V‘ ‘blown itself out, but left a heavy sea running that

: promised to leave little of the steamer before _the
day was over. Everybodyknew by this time that
V the loss of the steamer was due to the fact that

' Bird Point Light had not shone for hours during
theworst of the storm. The fact had also been‘
circulated that the failure of the light was due
to the villainy of two rascals-—-one 01; whim was
Batt Kattcher, of the village, while the other was
said to be Peter Fawls, a, lawyer of Eastlake,
connected with the ﬁsh-curing establishment of

' ‘that town. The only witnesses‘ implicating the
two men in the rascally job were Tom Rockwood
and Nat wills, but their word was considered good

"under the circumstances. The factthat

Kattcher was missing from the village was ac-
‘ cepted as conclusive evidence of his guilt.
‘ ' No one could understand what the villains ex-
pected to gain by their rascality, unless they had
a personal spite against rthe lightkeeper, and
hoped to ruin him by keeping the light out during
the ﬁerce gale.
, A dozen lives had been lost through the wreck,
but the only -one who had come ashore was the
sailor, Jack Tobin, and Tom and Nat asserted
that he had been as good as murdered on the
beach by Batt Kattcher and his associate, Peter
j Fawls. Neither of the boys said anything about

‘the paper which the dying sailor had given as ‘a

legacy to Tom.
~ as both he and Nat had been pretty well done up
' I by their night's strenuous ‘work. . ,,

After the sai.lor’s body had been taken to.the
village, Tom went to bed in his cabin, while Nat
return to the lighthouse. As Tom knew that
< Batt Kattcher and Peter Fawls wanted the docu-

I ment in the water—tight belt the worst way, and

judged. that they would employ every unfair
' ‘ means within their power to get possession of it,
‘~ he, as ‘a matter of precaution, hid the belt under
1‘ ‘a loose board, in the cabin before he turned in.

.s For all he know to the contrary, the villains
might be still hiding in the vicinity, looking for
‘ an opportunitw to pounce upon him unawares and
’ V take" the belt away ‘from him.

-‘Tom slept till two in the afternoon, and was
then awakened by hearing a knock at the door
of the cabin. He hopped out of bed, ran to the
window and peered out. _R_uby Rand was stand-
‘ing outside, her golden hair glistening in_ the sun-
light. Tomvopened the window. .

“Hello, Ruby, you there?”

-"Yes, Tom.” , ’

He opened the paper and‘ looked atiit. One 1 =
side‘ was ﬁlled with writing and ﬁgures, jumbled
together. ,¢,.«.Moses was not a very good scholar, _
having neglected -his tudies as much as he could,
so he found such di culty in trying to decipher - »:
the contents of the Eaper that he gave it ‘up, ‘- ’
shoved it back into t e belt and tossed the belt
on the rocks. “If I take that to dad he'll swear
I’ve‘taken the money, just as if I'd steal anythin’.
He’ll probably. wallop‘me instead of givinf me ten
dollars. I’ll tell him I couldn't ﬁnd theblamed V
old belt. ‘It ain’t no good, anyway, for there, v .
ain’t nothin’ in it but the paper.” ’ '

Moses took another look around, and ﬁnding
that the coast was still clear, he ventured ,'t0
enter Tom’s cabin again through the window.
Then he proceeded to look the place all over again,
though he had done that pretty thoroughly before
he lighted on the loose board underneath which
he found Jack Tobin’s belt. He was not success-
ful inﬁnding any money, though he almost made ~
a.wreck of the inside of the cabin. .

“Mebbe he’s taken it" with him,” thoughtt
young rascal. “What a shame, after all
trouble I’ve had lookin’_' for it!”' V V ,

At that moment a key was thrust into the lock 7 ’ H
and the door ‘opened. Moses was taken by sur-
prise. and tried to escape by the window. Tom
and Nat saw him as they were entering, and, the '
former gave a gasp. He rushed forward, caught
Moses by the leg and pulled him back into the’  V
room. I ,
“What are you doing in my cabin, Moses ..
Katt<_;he_r?” Tom demanded angrily.

"Nothin’,” answered Moses sulkily. . .

“Nothing!” cried Nat. “Just look at the room,.

Batt growled out some reply and told Moses to
get home right away, but to be sure and fetch a
supply of eatables in the morning. Shortly after
Moses departed again for the village Peter Fawls
appeared at the mill. He had seen Tom and Nat,
entering the suburbs of Eastlake, and feeling
satisﬁed they would return to Gosport later on,
and that most of the back journey would bemade

in the dark, it struck him as a good idea for him V I

and Batt to waylay and capture them. He sug-
gested the matter to his confederate as soon as
he reached the mill. 4 -

for the paper. If We 'can’t,,and he hasn’t the!

document about him. we can keep them prisoners , 

until we have made an erkhaustive search’Qf his
cabin for it.” «

Kattcher was willing} to beguided by any prom- _ i N

ising proposition advanced by the lawyer, and so
he agreed, with Fawls’ assistance, to ambush the

two boys on their wav home. After depositing the '

letter in the post-oﬁice Tom and Nat spent an
hour around town and then started forthe shore
While passing a clump of bushes not
far from the mill Kattcher and Fawls rushed
upon them with sticks and felled them to the
ground unconscious. __ .

CHAPTER lX.——In the Cellar of the Old ‘Mill.

“That was very neatly done,” said Peter Fawls, . 
“Now we. ‘_ - '

lookhig: down at the motionless boys.
must carry them to the mill." »

Suiting the actionxto the» word he raised Nat
Wills in his arms’ and started for

inside the gloomy old structure. The lamp they

they had left turned low was turned up andplthey " -V ‘

took, a better look at their DI‘b:One]‘S.

“I raised quite a’ lump on this chap’.-; head,;’ V

said the'la,wyer, alluding to Nat. ,

“And I laid Rockwood out as ﬂat as a pancake,'’. . 

said Kattcher.
“Now sz‘o through his pockets and seeif
can find the paper."

Batt did‘_so, but the important document wa.sU: V

not inhis clothes.

' “It’s still .in the belt and hidden somewhere in 
his cabin: We’ll tie these two lads to acouple ‘of ~
the supports of the'cellar and then we’ll go over ,:
to R0ckw0od’s cabin and search it thoroughly,"~

said Fawls. . ‘ _ ’ _v

Accordingly they 'cai'ried the boys dow‘njiiit'o
the ‘musty-smelling: cellar of the old mill in the
dark. Then the lawyer went back for the lamp,
and several pieces of thin rope, of which there?

was a lot in the upper back room. They tied Toni 7

and Nat in sitting positions to separate posts. ._

‘of it‘ to hold itdown. - ,
 “Even if they did succeed in freeing themselves
 1’ they can't g 1: out of the cellar to save .their
-- ’ lives.” said the lawyer. “Now we'll go to the
,—- ‘cabin and hunt for that belt.” ~
' . Kattcher blew out the light, put the lamp into
f ‘a small cupboard. and then the pair of rascals

, started for the bluff near the lighthouse. Al-
. though the crack Tom received on the head from

» the stick wielded by Batt Kattcher was suﬁiciently
hard to deprive him of consciousness for the ti e
being,_,he had not received the full force of the
blow. He recovered his senses half an hour after
the men left the mill. His ﬁrst sensation was
that of wonder at ﬁnding himself tied and help-
less in some place that was as dark as the ace of
, . spades. In a moment or two he began to under-
, ,_S,tB.Ild the situation. for before he ’was struck
‘ . down he caught a glimpse of the two men, whom
he recognized as his enemies, rushing upon him-
; self and Nat with uplifted sticks, that descended
._on their heads before either could dodge the
H-blows. . ' -

“I see through the matter now,” he muttered.
“The rascals waylaid us on our way back to the
. shore. They must have seen us on the road and

laid their plans to do us up. The question is,
‘wh’e’re are we and what are they going to do with

us.
Tom thought of the belt around his waist at
once. Of course Kattcherand Fawls had searched
. him while he was unconscious and found it'o'n his
_' person. That .was what the_ were after. ,
.,,they had tied and left him he pless in some place
that appeared to be a room. He did not know of
‘ any buildingin the. neighborhood of the spot
‘ where he and Nat had been assaulted except the
oldmill. He therefore naturally concluded that
he was in the mill. - ‘

__ ‘.‘If they've gone on and left me here in this
[state I’ll starve to death, for nobody eyer visits
;'the mill. I wonder what they did with Nat?
Maybe he’s here, too. I. don't hear a sound,
3 though, to indicate that anybody besides myself’
' is in the room.” ”’ , .
> [Tom shouted Nat’s name several timesgand re-
" ceiving no reply he struggled a bit with his bonds,
but they held him almost as if he were ina vise.

“This is ﬁerce,” he grumbled. “Ngt and I ought
:\ to have been on our guard against a possible sur-
. prise; but the last thing we‘ thought of was the
possibility of an attack from Kattcher and his
friend. That’s where we were foolish. We’ ought"
tohave suspected that the rascals might be hang-
g around the neighborhood, watching‘ for a‘
chance to‘ secure that paper. The fact that Batt
Kattcher sent his son to my cabin to searchjfor it
i was proof of -his presence in this vicinity, and
wherever he was one might reasonably conclude

that Fawls was with him.” ‘

“Now,” said Tom in a determined tone, “if we ‘
can get out of this cellar I am going to make a
strenuous effort to recover that paper.” .' ‘

“I’ll back you up,” replied Nat. '

“Follow me and see that you don’t make any
noise. _The stairway is over yon'der.” 

Tom led the way. Ascending the short but
stout ﬂight of steps he put his hands against the q .
bottomof the trap and pushed on it. 'It; rose a
slowly-without noise. and Tom saw Kattcher and . 
-the lawyer, with their backs to him, poring over 
the paper which was his legacy. Tom let thetrap

him what he had‘ seen. ' 2 ~

“All right,” agreed Tom. “The_v’re both in a  ,

Nat got the ropes, and as both were experts in 
making all kinds of sailor knots they soon made
a couple of nooses that would fill the bill.

The two rascals were in the same positions, study- « -; 4

-.,The ﬁsherman hurled all kinds of threats at
v Tom, but they made no impression on the boy.
He quietly folded up the paper relating to the al-
leged treasure, replaced it in the belt, and
strapped the belt about his waist again. The next
- thing was what were they to cl with the men?
They were both wanted to answer for the crime
' of putting out the lighthouse lamps and thereby
—.causing the loss of the steamer “Windy City."
— Tom considered‘ it his duty to hand them over to
. the authorities. To accomplish this it would be
 "necessary to get more complete control of the
' rascals than they had, especially of Batt Kattch-
, » er, who ‘was strong enough to be almost unman-
- ageable even with his armstied to his sides.
“Get a couple pieces
yonder. Nat," Tom said.
' , The lighthouse keep‘er's son brought the line.
, “We must trip Kattcher up and tie his legs,"
said Tom in a low tone. _
The ﬁsherman, suspecting their purpose, made
' a desperate ‘eﬁort to get free. The boys jumped
on him, tripped him up, and after a big ﬁght
succeeded in securing his legs together. Tom
— then lifted’ the trap and they shoved the man

rights, and then Nat agreed to remain all night
with Tom, to help him in case the‘ enemy made
‘another descent on -the cabin. The clock had ,‘i :'
struck two when Tom awakened from a disquiet-
ing dream. In his vision Batt Kattcher: and
Peter Fawls had broken into the cabin, and while
one was holding him helpless the other was re»-
lieving him of his belt with the paper. ' - « ,

At that moment he heard sounds at the door.
He listened intently, his nerves all of a tingle;
He was soon satisﬁed that somebody was try‘ ‘ylr
to force the door with some kind of an

the front window. I was a dark night, the ‘on!

of two ﬁgures outside. one of whom was bent
over, working at the door. Nobody but Butt

and awakened Nat. ’  , y ,

“Batt Kattcher and Fawls are trying

“I do mean it. Listen and ‘you'll ‘hear’ one of

lish the guilt of Batt Kattcher and Peter Fawls.

The inspector told them that they would be called ~ 

on to testify at the trial of the accused, no doubt

being entertained but that the lawyer would soon ,5‘:

the detectives returned to Eastlake they learned

that Peter Fawls had given himself up, and asked - ‘K
for an immediate examination for himself and.

QKCHAPTER XII.—What the Document
Contained. » '

Tom had been pretty well occupied all day and
neither he nor Nat thought about the document
in the belt until they were eating supper that eve-,
ning. . J " ,

“We'll read it after we get through eating,”-v
said Tom; “that is. if we are not interrupted
again." - . 2*;

That suited Nat. who was extremely eager to
learn about the alleged treasure that his friend"
was heir to. When the dishes were washeddip.
and the kitchen put to rights, Tom got the paper
out of the belt, -and the second attempt to master’.
its contents was begun. This is what he read:

“Sewfenteen miles W. N. W. of Cross villag-
Emmet County, Michigan,‘ and almost directl in
line with the Strait of Mackinac, is a small is and
called Hog Island. Here in‘the year 18_62.ca'm‘e'.w
one Jean Frontenac, a French Canadian, to live."
He dwelt on .the island eighteen years, living ‘a’
hermit’s existence. in a small hovel near the
shore. He supported himself by ﬁshing and rais-Q
ing certain garden truck, on a small patch of!
groundibehind his-hut. He died a month ago,

. just one week‘ after 1. Jack Tobin, was maroon ,
on this‘ island by Capt. Batt Kattcher, of the “

ﬁshing sloop ‘Pandora,’ hailing from Gosport vii};

certain smuggling operations of Kattcher and hi
confederate, Peter Fawls. a lawyer of Eastlakie-,
a town near Go_spor , These two were hand-in
glove in the business of running cases of Franc
cognac fromthe village’ of Putney, on the Ca
nadian shoreg to Gosport in the sloop ‘Pandora.
Jean Frontenac was ill in bed when I came acros
him, and I did my best to -fetch him around, by

he had buried the sum of $100,000 in French go
at a certain spot near his cabin, the exact lo’ "
tion of which he described to me as follows: _ _

was somewhat peaked, being well protected from
the weather by asphaltum cloth, strips‘ of which
were tacked over the cracks between all the
’ ,,—boards forming the front, back and sides. The
 framework of the doorway was made in regular
Q carpenterd style, which could also be said of two
‘ small windows on either side Q it, both the door
 ‘and window sashes being regulation ones, and
- working on hinges. ‘ _

' Apparently the house had been built, without
having been put together, by a master carpenter,
‘and had then been brought to the island by. the

7 rFrenchman and by him erected where it stood.
g“_Thére was no lock on the door‘; a simple latch‘
T, ‘holding it shut. In the inside were two Stout
\’~ bolts, and each window had a small bolt. The
M house consisted of only one room, ﬂoored with
iboards, raised a few inches from the" ground, and
 a. trench was dug all around the building to k_eep_

- the rain from making its way under the ﬂooring.
. The furniture consisted of a small iron bed with
a mattress and bedclothes, a small cook stove, a

 

equipped with a drawer in which the boys found
‘ 1a‘ small collection of knives, forks and spoons.
 ‘good-sized cupboardvfastenedto the wall held
,.  -all the necessary crockery that the. occupant was
' f ‘likely to use in many years. A good assortment
of agateware pots and pans was suspended _in
the corner where the stove stood, together with
 other articles essential to housekeeping,.1ncluding'
i ii couple of ﬂatirons. _ ‘.

There were several tin pans,_one. large enough
,for‘a;..person to wash clothes in, and in fact no

that fitted the ﬂoor exactly covered the boards,

' anda wide piece of zinc stood under the stove and
kept the ashes and sparks from the rug. A clock
that had run down stood -on one of the shelves,
ﬂanked by‘the photographs of an elderly man
and woman. Another pair of shelves were ﬁlled

and brought the compass. " , ,
When» they started to measure off thirty paces ,f__»
due east they found the job out of the questi'oii,.;i5.

in the cabin that I guess will answer the purpose,”
said Nat. Tom drove a stake at a certain spot.
walked thirty paces and drove another. Then’
while Nat held one end of the line he found in the
cabin, Tom measured‘ it 011'. ‘  ;
When he reached -the second stake he found
to his surprise that the rope just fitted. Then
it struck him that this was_the line used by Jack
Tobin, possibly also by the dead Frenchman when
he buried his treasure. He called Nat’s attention
to'the fact and his companion agreed with hi,
There was a loop in one end of the line, and the
boys found a stake driven into the earth on’ the
edge of the trench at the northeast corneroi
the cabin. ‘ , ‘ 
“That stake was put there to hold the ropeﬁ ,
said Tom, dropping the loop over it and laying:.
the compassdown. “Itstrikes me that Kajttcheim v

as he took Nat’s place and shoved his shovel deep
into the earth. It struck against something that
resistedthe edge. In _a few minutes he uncovered
.a.._bit of weed, and as "soon as he threw more of
the earth out more of the wood showed ‘with a
 pa.rt'of a brass band. Tom worked away rapidly
Vmtil he had exposed the whole of the top‘of a
brass—bound chest. then he let Nat dig the earth
., from around the sides and ends, which: took time.

-“Go back to the house and unloosen that line.

leased the loop from the stake. Then they ran
lthe line through one of the handles and tried to
lift it, but they couldn't budge it aybit.

, “How the dickens did that’ Frenchman bring it

“Ten bags,” he said. “That means that there's

“That’s right,” replied Nat. ‘ . . '  :

“Two is about all we can carry-at a time,”: said 
Tom. “Pick up a ple and follow‘ me.” He led’ *
the way to the s op and they. stowed the bags

brought the compass, shovel and other tools... » . - 

“‘It’s about four o’clock now,” said Tom. .“I 
don’t believe the ‘Pandora’ will get here‘ before 
dark. We’ll get our dinner and after that start ‘ .,f
for home.” '

“I’ll do the cooking,” volunteered Nat. While
Nat was busy about the little stove in the fore-:,
peak Tom revisited the Fi'enchman’s cabin. _

“I guees I'll take possession of that shotg'un.. 
If I don’t somebody aboard‘ the ‘Pandora’ will J ,3 
get away with it.” On a shelf close by he found - ’
a box full of loaded cartridges, probably ﬁlled‘ 
with buckshot, and behind it .a loaded revolver 
and cartridges to fit it. He carried both the _ V.
weapons and all the cartridges back to the sloop, I I ‘
where he found a meal of bacon and eggs nearly. '
reacly for consumption. The boys ate leisurely
and talked about the treasure. _ .

“One of those bags is yours, Nat,” said Tom. 
.“If that isn’t enough you can have two. 'We’re' ' ed;
chums and nothing is too good for you.” * , 

“Thanks, Tom. I'm more than satisﬁed with

"Oh-, I don’t know what I’ll do. I’ll have to] ° '
consider that after we get back. Come, now,’we’1l.
wash the dishes up and then haul thecsloop out of,
the creek. It is getting on to sundown.” 
“Gee! There’ll be something doing when Katt'- _
cher and Faw1s_ get here and discover that tlie,~.. "

were washing up the dinner things. “Captain ~
Kattcher can swear some when he gets’ going.”'_ I  "
“The ‘Pandora’ is not likely to get here till" a£lt- ‘
er dark. so that Kattcher and the lawyer will-_
hardly ﬁnd out whathas happened until tomoril-"

at Gosport,” said Tom. In -a’ few minutes Tom»
stepped ashore to untie the sloop’s painter from"
the tree. Happening to glance out over the water.
he saw something that made him gasp-" There,‘
was_the ‘“Pandora,’,’ under full sail, coming, into’
the wide bay. ' \ . , j_
Tom jumped aboard and carried the news tm.

The boys watched the “Pandora'." come to ancho '

Frencl1man’s cabin. Tom and Nat saw them

futes come out again and go around to the rear.

riients and agﬂrced to put it in 1‘:orce._ So the
painter was cast oil’ and the two boys pushed the
'_boat».do.wn the creek to the bay and then rushed

: canvas and with Tom at the helm the little sloop
»starteclout into the lake. The ﬁshermen loung-
ng‘ on the'_“Pa,ndora's” deck of course saw Tom's
craft, but its. presence there’had.'no‘significance

headed ,. south toward home before Kattcher,

now that your ‘face don’t.,betray you. ~ Remember *
that, no matter what happens, you are to give no‘
sign of being able to hear." u ,
They had reached “Mr. ‘Bum’s” now, and‘the_*
doctor, ‘opening the door of the dirty saloon which
occupied the ground ﬂoor of the old» building, drew ,.
Will inside. ’ 5 ~ , ‘ . , ‘—t '’
’ The place was so ﬁlled with smoke that for the,
moment Will could discern nothing. Then he saw
that a number of coifee-colored seamen were sit- »
_ and there :
was “Mr. Bum” himself behind. thebar. :. ‘
The moment he caught sight of the doctor he 
threw up his hands and called out some
telligible words. ‘ '
Instantly every man in the dplace,‘ including ,

“Mr. Bum” himself. turned an bowed low to
Doctor Pajaro-and Will.’ . ' i —. ’

 

CHAPTER X.
Mr. Bum, the Fakir.

Will had now; entered upon‘ as strange an ex-',_T
perience as ever befell a boy in. New York, it is
safe’ to say; and perhaps the strangest part of it}
was the fact that he was at the time destined to"
understand little of what it all meant. ' c

As has been stated, the first thingthat struck: ‘
him was the intense respect shown to "Dr. Pa
jaro by all the Hindu sailors; . L _ *

Evidently Mr. Bum had been informed them of‘.
his rank, and to Will it wasequally evident that,
the doctor's claim that he was one of the heredit-'7
a princes of India was quite true. - " ‘

‘ aving_ bowed to the doctor, the sailorsre,-.
mained standing while he spoke a few hurried 
words in his own language to Mr. Bum, who  .

  
   
        
     
       
   
  

  

  
    
       
 
    
  

Will now began to feel more secure, for nobody
paid particular attention to him. In fact, Mr. Bum
scarcely glanced at him as hehurriedlyleft the ;
saloon, and Willbegan to feel more respect £0"
his disguise than he had at the outset. ' 4

The doctor now moved about among theagsgivl
speaking to each one in'tui_'n. Hi remarks,’
ever they may have been were received with)-th_
most profound respect. it was perfectly eviden“
that all felt highly honored by his presence. 

In a moment Mr. Bum appeared, accom 
by a young man whom Will had always‘ ta on...
be a colored person, and whom he had’ often
spoken with. . “ . 1 ‘ N

‘The young“ man scarcely looked aﬁhim as it
took his place behind the bar. ' »  

Mr. Bum then motioned to the doctor, andmahﬁi
