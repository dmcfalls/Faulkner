CHAPTER IV.

That the detective was ar_na.zed by the consequences of 
his experiment must be understood. He had not dared

to hope for such results when he began the whistlingof

tunes and ended by the shouting of given names from -

an adjoining room.

. The name Henry had almost escaped him in his cecal  

to think ofiall the names he could, to test the old man

with. It had come to him‘ only at the last moment, and ~~
then‘ as ‘afterthought, although it is a common enough

'name.— ~<
But when he saw that the enunciation of it affected the

old gentleman, and realized that there was still some-
thing wanting to perfect the effect, the natural combine-5.
names of Henry and Clay occurred 

tion of’ the two

He thought‘ instantly that Cranky had‘ beenhorn lag;
abontithe time when many fathers delighted in 

their sons after the famous statesinan, and s‘o,”with9u

of Henry Clay. ‘ .
l Theresult of that happy thought we have already seen,

’_ if ivinghhimself 2 second thoughtghe had shouted OIﬂZ'fll¢,,‘

and Nick did not doubt that instead of living this

aecount for the effect that the utteranceof“

 -Mr. Sinclair, who was none other than ‘Mark,’ the vil-

lain I had followed all the afternoon. He looked likeia

‘~  gentleman His features were regular and ﬁnely cut; the‘
« , lines" around the mouth were expressive of a determined‘

will, slightly inclined to stubbornness.‘ “His. eyes were

’ ‘ full and black, small and piercing; his forehead ‘broad,
showing a high order of intelligence. Altogether he was '

tain something aboutrhim that stamped him as agvillain.
