ceeded to do this, and Will followed suit. »An
hour later, during which time they had thorough-
ly canvassed the situation, their things were as
dry as a bone, and they dressed themselves.
“ “I suppose your watch has stopped?” said

Jack.
' “Yes,” answered Will, after looking at it. “It
is not likely to go again until a jeweler has over-

hauled it.”
“Got any coin, about you?” asked Jack.
“Why do you ask?” said Will, in some sur-
prise as he felt in his-pockets.‘ " _,
“I haven't ared, and] thought if you had a
piece of money of any kind—-a‘ cent. would do as
‘well as any-—-we’_d toss up to see which way we’d'
0. ,There doesn’t seem to be any choice, as
— don't see that it makes any difference at all
whichway we go, but still I believe in luck. By
tossing up we leave our route to fate. and fortune
might favor us in that case,” said Jack.
“I agree with you. I’ve got half a dozen Eng-
‘lish sovereign. and some silver, as well as a $10
bill,” replied Will. '
“Toss up the shilling. If the queen’s head
comes up we will go toward yonder point; if the
other side shows uppermost we’ll start down the
coast.” ,, .
“All right,” said Will, and’ he tossed the coin.
When it struck the sand the boys looked at it.
The queen’s head met their eyes. .
“The point it is.” said Jack,’ starting in that
“Come on.”
They walked maybe two miles, passing little
hillocks of sand, and bits of recent wreckage here

' and there. »

“Looks as if some vessel had been-wrecked
hereabouts,” said’ Will.
“Nothing; surprising in that. The gale we al-
most weatheredwas a stiff one,” replied Jack.
, “Look at that broken spar y0n(ler wabbling
' about in the water near the beach. Must have
been a vessel of some size."

“She was a square-rigger, for that’s a yard."

‘‘There’s ‘a boat half—smashed on the beach.
Maybe it has the name of the. lost vessel on its
stern.” / ‘ _ ‘

- “We’1l see when we get to it.”

“I wish something worth eating or drinking
had come ashore. My stomach is awfully empty.
I’d give that $10 bill for a square meal.”

“I’d give more than that if"I had it,” said Jack. I

"‘Money is of no value on this shore, while a

‘V  meal’ of any kind would go a long way toward

keeping us alive. Our very lives might depend
on a single meal.” . ‘
When they‘ reached the smashed life-boat they
found no name on its stern. Will was about to
continue on when Jack stopped him.
“Wait till I overhaul her,” he said. “There’s a

 sort of locker in her bows. There might be
" something in it ‘of value to us.” , 

“What do you expect to ﬁnd?” '
“Quite often a skipper keeps his boats pro-
visioned in case of an emergency. We had four

He pro-.

    

_ “Then let’s look into that locker,” replied Will’.
in some excitement. , ’ —
Jack proceeded to do so. He found. a small '
ﬂat cask full of something which he guessed Twas’ ‘ ,
water, and a package tightly wrapped up ‘in’ oil,-_. " "

Jack-knife, he dug out the stopper of the cask =
and found it was water. , .  ‘_~?-vi
' “You can take first drink while I'm unwrap-
ping this bundle, which is almost sure to.-eon ‘
tain something we can eat.” -. "7 “
Will drank greedily of the water, forhe was 
almost parched. ‘When he put the cask down’; ‘
Jack had the bundle open. It contained 21‘ Packs ’
age of crackers and severalcrbcks of -potted meat.-
bearing English labels.  ' 5»:
Will seized one, and got the cover off‘ whil ~
Jack was taking a drink. The way the -‘co"ntent's

it over his shoulder. ‘, I ',‘-  I’ -
“You carry the water cask, Will, and'when'

“‘Let’s sit down and rest,” said Will. “I’m tired}? 
He threw the cask down on the sand, and J‘ '
followed suit with the package. They were,
to a sweep in the shore, and the_ view "ahead
was cutoff by a dense mass of shrubbery."=' .»

“Well, what do you think of those two chaps?”
asked Jack. .

“Is-think their room is better than their com-
pany,” said Will.
.~“That’s my opinion. They’re bad eggs.’ I'm
‘glad we didn't run foul of them.”
l “I should say so. We’ll camp here for the
night. That will give them a good start of us.”
Although it was now night l-"116 Sky W35 Ye‘
splendent with stars, and the air as clear as a
bell, that they could easily see around them for
a.considerable distance. The wind had ﬁned down
to a light breeze. but the ‘waves still rolled in
« with some force. making quite a surf. The boys
talked about their chances of reaching 'a civilized
place on the morrow until the fatigue they had
lately been through overcamethem, and they fell
asleep in the shadow of the bushes. The sun was
well up when they awoke in the morning. The
sea was nearly calm now, and there was hardly
any wind.
“Well. old man, how do‘ you feel?” asked Jack.
“As good as I can expect to feel under the
— circumstainces,” replied Will, not very enthusi-
astic-ally.
“Let’s eat and then izet a move On.”
.The ‘boys opened their supplies and proceeded
_. ' to make a breakfast. .

" al.l'in leaving things to chance.” _

* 'Fifteen minutes later they were on their way
again. Walking in the heat of a tropical sun
was very fatiguing to them. for they were not
used to such a thing, and so they gladly welcomed
«the sight of what seemed to be a wood in the
distance. It took an hour’s tramp to reach it,
and by that time they were completely done up.
Throwing themselves on the ground, they rested
for nearly an hour. and then resumed their .l011I‘*

~ net‘ under the leafy covert, keeping within a
’ short distance of the sea so that they would not
0 astray, since Jack b4=lie"'ed. that there was
more chance of their meeting a village: near the

  water than away froni"it. When noon came they .

were still in the ions W°°d- They stopped; and

they saw a rude shanty that looked as if it was

deserted. _
 f‘We’d better stop here, for the night. What
y do you say?” said Will.

7 Before Jack could reply a pistol shot rang out,
rooming from the house. It was followed by a
-shrill scream, apparently from a ‘girl. ,

“Help! Help!” cried the voice in English.
3’ s «‘‘There’s a woman in trouble, Will." cried Jack
a excitedly. “Come on; let's see what the matter is.”

CHAPTER lIII——-Roger Gale and His ,D.‘aughter. 

When Jrack reached the doonand looked‘ in
he saw a young and pretty girl struggling‘ in
the arms of one of the two ruﬂianly sailors ‘he’
and Will had seen‘ the evening ‘before on‘_tlie
seashore. while theother stood in a drunken at'—' ‘
titude looking on, apparently maintaining, his
equilibrium with great tliﬁiculty. On the floor’Iay.,.
an elderly man, bleeding from a wound on‘th‘e.—
side of the head, either dead or unconscious. The
fellow who had hold of the girl was almost as-_,__.
tipsy as .:h1s compaiiidn. Jack recognized him. as "' ’
the person answering to the name of Sam Grii‘"r'en.. '

Apparently he had done the shooting, and"/the
revolver lay in the middlelof the floor. The . :'r1'
was doing her best to ﬁght the rufﬁan 'oﬂ", _ _ut-‘
was like an infant in his muscular grasp. .-

“There ain’t no use of you tryin’ to stop me,  '—‘f“

in the mouth, and tore the’ girl.fro’ii'i“ his grasp ’

7 Jack brought the water-keg, and held it while
she drank from the bung-hole, as that was the
only ‘way. When she had satisﬁed her thirst he
handed her half a dozen of the crackers. The boys
then ate sparingly themselves. Later on, when
Mr. Gale awoke much better and refreshed by his
sleep, Jack helped him to the water and a share
of the provendei‘. Jack then satisﬁed his’ curi-

. osity concerning the presence of himself and his’
Wfriend in that out-of—the-way spot, and he in turn '

told the boys something about the voyage of the
ill—fated Molly Owen after she had sailed north
from Rio ‘de J aneiro till she was overtaken and
Wrecked by the gale. ’ Then they all talked about
their prospects of reaching civilization before lack
' of food knocked them out. All Mr. Gale knew
about their position was that they were on the
south shore of the delta of the Orinoco, probably

_ .at least 100 miles from the mouth of the river.
~‘;., .» ‘‘Do you know of any towns along this shore?”
 * askeclIJack._ ' ~ ’

, _“I know there is a‘ place called Placoa, about
twenty-ﬁve miles this side of the river, and I
know there is, a.town by the name of Barrancas
on the northern side of the river near its mouth,
but that is the extent of my knowledge of this
part of Venezuela. There are probably many na-

' . tive villages scattered about in this neighborhood,
, _ but we are likely to hit one more by accident than

 anything else. We must try to reach Placoa, for
we can’t miss it by going straight on, provided
.. we are able to . et that far. I should imagine
* . that it would ta e us several days traveling on

 foot to reach it.” i T ‘ . .

“We c‘an’t‘get there then unless we ﬁnd some-
thing more to eat. What we have will not last
over tomorrow,” said Jack. . _, ,

four shillings, which _Will supplied, and_he seemed
perfectly satisfied with the remuneration. As a
matter of fact, he was well pai_d. The party then
‘started: in the direction _in which the village “lay,
falong a well-deﬁned trail made by Wagon Wheels
wand animals. They reached the village about two
e

l*;‘o’clock, and Jack arned that there was an inn

 

fat the further end of it. Their presence in the '

      
  
 

.~:-yr "lace attracted much attention and curiosity as
'’ ihey passed along, and they were followed by
‘an increasing mob of children until they reached
;the inn, which was a two-story stone structure,
very old in appearance, and very dirty and un-
. kempt. The landlord was lounging in the door-
way,.smoking a long chero,ot, and he ‘eyed the
 party with no great favor. Jack asked’ for ac-
 commodation aiid information. ‘
 “How far is it to Placoa?” he asked the boni-
‘ face. »
"‘Over,one hundred miles,” was the reply‘.
“‘As far as that, eh? Can we get a wagon to
takeus there? ” '
> The man shook his head.
" “We will pay you good.” ' .
U“You have money?” said the landlord, begin-
in to show interest at last. ‘
~ . “%Ve have some,” replied Jack.
«_ pm ' “How much?” asked the landlord. ‘ _
' ' f‘Enough to pay you for entertainment till to-
morrow morning and the services of a wagon
driver, if we can get one, to take us to Placoa.”
 r . The landlord seemed to reﬂect while he scanned
" "the" four critically. Finally he bluntly stated his
"charge for the accommodation asked for, and
his ‘price was "double his customary rates. Jack
said they would pay it. The man, however, wanted
tosee some evidence of their funds before he
' would accept‘ their custom. I
. ."Show him a sovereign, Will,” said Jack.
Will‘—-pulled out the six ‘and displayed them be-
fore the landlord's eyes. The man’s eyes sparkled
.jc,o'vetously, and he became all smiles and polite-
ness at once. With a low how he wavedthemin.
The room they were i_ntroduced to was “the main
'Tone of the inn, but it was not particularly invit-
hing particularly to a young lady like Jessie Gale.
’ ,acl{' inquired as to the accommodations they
ould have for the night. The landlord said he
Leould let them have three separate rooms, and

man led ‘the way upstairs to the ‘next story, and
. owed them the rooms. There was a single bed
in ‘each, and not much of a bed at that. The

said Will. “We never could have made our wants
known to the boss of-this alleged hotel.”

‘.‘Yes, for Spanish is spoken, more or less, all
through South America.”.

“Where did you pick it up?”

“Down in Rio, where I stopped about six_

months, owing to a game leg.”

“There is onevthing that talks better than any
language,” grinned Will. ‘

“What is that?”

“Money. Did you notice how that fellow took
his hat off to us as soon as I showed him the
six sovereigns?” ‘

“You ought not to have displayed all your
money. I told you to show him one. Now he’ll
soak us good for everything we have.”

“He named his price before he saw my money.”

“That doesn’t make any difference. He’ll charge
for extras that we won’t get or are not worth
what he asks for them.”

“We won’t pay him.”

“It probably would not be to our interest to_

scrap with him.” - .

“I don’t believe in being robbed.”

“Your objection won’t cut much ice.”. '

“But we’ll need all our funds when he reach
Placoa.” V

“That’s nothing to the landlord. He’ll roast
us as well as he can.”

At that moment two men came around the cor- ,

ner of the building. One glance satisﬁed the

boys as to their identity. They'were~-the sailors,_

Griffin and Flipper.

CHAPTER V.—Threatened Trouble.

The two sailors saw the boys at the same_mo- ‘
_ ment, and they stopped and regarded them with

black looks. Jack returned their stare with one
of indifference. The sailors consulted and-then
retired the way they came. - , -
“We’ll have to look out for them; they will

“If they ther us tiiey’re likely to encounter

other sleeps, turn a'ndvtum.about.”

“You must tell Mr._Gale and his daughter that ‘ I

that came his way. If hedistrusted a“ man he
kept his weather eye lifting for possible trouble.
He was never asleep, so it was hard to catch him
. napping. In due time they were called to supper,
” , and found a good meal on the table. Jessie and
‘her_ father came down, and the first thing’ Jack
did was to tell them ofthe presence of Griifen and
Flipper. The girl looked a bit uneasy, for since
, her encounter with Griifen she feared the man.
ﬂack assured her that he and Will would protect
er. '
, “We each have a revolver, you know, with a
supply of cartridges,” he said, “so it won’t be
safe ,for anybody to try any monkey shines with
you.’ _ .
They enjoyed the meal very much, and at .th
end of it the landlord appeared with a jug; of
liquor and =thr: : cheroots similar to what he
smoked himself. He laid the jug before Mr. Gale,
’ and handed the smokes around. The boys tossed
. theirs to Mr. Gale. -
« “The liquor and the cheroots will be charged
extra,” said Jack to Will.
“Why so? We didn’t order them.”
. “That doesn’t matter. That's the way this fel-
‘ low does business.” . 1
“You seem to have him down pretty ﬁne.”
. ' “Every foreign landlord tries to make all he
‘ can out of his customers-——especially when he
knows they are Americans.”
“I don’t.see why Americans should be a special
inark for graft.”

“Guess at it. I judge that it isn’t more than‘!

Thepboys found a couple of stools in the room,
and took possession of them. Time passed slow-
ly with them. The house was quiet except at the
kitchen end, whence they could hear loud talking
and laughter. Jack ﬁnally got tired of inaction,
and crept down the rear stairs and listened to
what was goin
to be occupied

judged by the clinkingof the glasses. The two
womenhe had seen in there, servants of the house,
appeared to have retired and left the room to the
men who had come to enjoy themselves. The
landlord was there, for Jack recognized his voice.
There was a door at the end of the passage.
Jack opened it and looked out. The night was
bright, and he could see ‘all around the immediate
vicinity. He didn’t see anybody moving. Step-
ping outside Jack walked around to the front of
the house. The two sailors were sitting near the
front door, talking and smoking. The‘ idea oc-
curred to the boy that the easiest way out of
their diﬁiculty would be for them to leave the
inn on the sly while the coast was clear’. Accord-

ingly he returned to Will, who had been impa-., 

tiently waiting for him in the dark, and told him
what he proposed doing. ’
“That’s a good idea,” replied Will.

Jack at once went to the room occupied by Mr.-
Gale, amused him, and in as few. words as pos-

sible told him what they were up against. 4110‘

was astonished and much disturbed. ‘He agreed
with the boy's proposition to leave the place on
the quiet. Dressing himself, he went to the next
room and awakened his daughter. After explain-
ingmatters he told her to dress herself as quickly
as’ she could, and join them all in the corridor.
In ten minutes ‘she came .out’ of the room. "

room, but did not close his door, somewhat to
Jack’s uneasiness, since they dared not make a
move as long as the man was in, a position to
observe them. The boss of the roost moved
around his room for a few minutes, then came
out into the corridor and listened. All was still.

After standing for a short time, as if. de1iberat- '

ing over something, he started along the corridor
toward the rooms allotted to his four guests.
Jack opened the door and looked after him. It
was so dark that he couldn’t see his ﬁgure. Never-
theless he suspected the man’s object. He believed
that his purpose was to go to the room in which-‘
ﬁnd Will and him asleep by this

order to possess himself of the six sovereigns he

«V had seen, and any other money the boy had.

Jack's conjecturewas correct, for that was the
man’s object. His cupidity had been excited by
the gold, and he had an idea Will had not shown
him all he possessed. The fellow was so silent
and cautious in his movements that Jack could
not tell when he entered one of the rooms. He
knew that it would only be a question of a few
moments when the landlord would discover that
they had left their rooms, and that would arouse
his suspicions as well as his anger. They had

little time to lose before there would be a ruction '

in the lace that would arouse attention and lead
to trou le. Relying on the darkness to obscure
their retreat, Jack called on the others to follow

im.

“Make as little noise as you can, for the land-
lord is down the corridor,” he said. ,

They followed him to the head of the ljiacﬁ
ac

was silent, and there was no one in sight.

“Come on,” he said, stepping outside, and they
followed him. '

There was an outhouse close by, and Jack’s
object was to put that between them and the inn
to begin with. It would serve to hide their
further retreat to the woods behind. They reach-
ed the building without discovery, and then
hurried off toward a ﬁeld that lay between the inn
and the woods. They had barely reached and
entered it when they became aware of a com-
motion in the rear.

“The landlord has found out that we have
dusted out, and he is raising Cain and organizing
immediate pursuit,” said Jack.. “Unless we are
seen crossing this field he’ll naturally conclude

‘we have gsne down the road, that is, unless Grif~ '
‘fen and

is compaion can swear that, we have
.not. That all depends on how lon those two
rascals have been sitting in the ront of the
house, which commands a‘ view of the road.”
The arty got an extra hustle on{, and ra‘n to-

reached it quite out of breath, and stopped while

' ~ Jack reconnoitered. They could see'the inn in

the moonlight, and 'ade out nearly a,doz'en per-
sons moving about t ere. ’
“We'll go on,” said Jack. “The sooner we
Elace some distance between us and the inn the
etter our chancesfor escape will be.”
They were about to start, ahead when the‘ rapid

 gallop of horses ‘came to their ears. TWO more»
mountedpersons were approaching them through

the wood. That made their position awkward.

The two rascals started for the inn. As .soon
as they passed out of the wood the fugitives~§,.j
came from their place of concealment. \ , 2'

“Here’s luck,” said Jack. '

Along one of the walls was a line of pegs for
hanging hats and clothes. There were many other
things which it is not necessary to particularize.
Before ‘Jack had completed his survey a dog bark~
ed in the yard at a furious rate, and the party
heard his chain rattle as if he was tugging at it.
The woman put down her work and came toward
the door. Jack hastily left the window and went
to meet her.

“What do you want?” she asked in"a surly tone
in Spanish.

“ls this an inn?” asked the boy.

“Yes, but we donft take in everybody.”

“There are four of us—a gentleman. his daugh-
ter, another boy and myself. We want supper,
beds, and breakfast.” ,

The woman neared at the rest of the party.

“Come iii,” she said. “I will send a man to
take charge of your horses.”

Jack helped Jessie to dismount, and she and her
father entered the house, while Jack and Will held
the animals till a ro’ugh-looking fellow came out
of the yard and took charge of them. The boys
then went into the house. The four sat on -a set-
_tee on one side of the room, feeling very much

B

like cats in a strange garret.

Presently an overgrown. clownish-looking youth
appeared and began setting one end of the -big
table for four. It didn't take him long,,and then
he disappeared. In the course of half an hour a
;rude'repast was ready for the party. and the W0-
man told them to sit up and eat. She resumed
‘her occupation, but Jack noticed that she was fur-

‘ tively watchinvr them. When the meal was fin-

-ished Jack said they would like to go to bed. as
they, were tired. The woman summoned the clown-

‘ ish boy and ordered him to show the party to the

  yawn, and half undressed. , :'

 
 

rooms she mentioned on the ﬂoor above. The boy
, took three candles and led the way. As thev were
ascending the stairs they heard a clatter of hoofs, ’
outside, and that indicated several new arrivals.
Jessie was shown into a small corner room, her
father to one adjoining it, while the boys were
taken to a room further on. The boy left a candle
in each room. and then returned downstairs.
“I’m fagged out,” said Will. “I shall sleep like ,
a topto-night.”
‘Jack walked to the window that opened on the
road and looked out. The moon was just rising

' above the tree-tops and shone full on the house.

‘The boy heard an-excited conversation in Spanish

if’ going on below. He looked down and then he got

a shock. He saw the two sailors, Griffen and
‘Flipper, and-their rascally native cognpanions,

orningo and Silva, with two other ellows of
their own breed. standing at the door talking to
the‘ woman and--rough-looking. man. From what
Jack heard. the newcomers had learned_of their
arrival and were in high glee over the discovery...

"Will,” whispered Jack. ‘
“What do you want?” asked his friend ‘with a

“That's who they’ are. The other four are "

“I say,,this is tough.” . f

“It certainly is. I’m going to warn Mr. Gale.”

Jack slipped out of the room, and made his way» 
along the corridor to the room occupied by J essie's; j
father. The door was not locked so he walked‘ in. ‘

“Who’s there?” asked the gentleman, who was :
already in bed. \ '

‘‘Me—Jack.’’ . >

“Oh! Well, you have something to tell me?”

“I have bad news.” V ‘_ _

“Bad news!” cried the gentleman, sitting up, ' 

“Yes. ‘We have been tracked to this place by- "

the corridor, and found that there was oniy one
ﬂight of stairs leading to it. , v i  ‘ 

‘‘They’ll have to come up that way, and we must’ ,

“Yes. Miss Gale must be protected at any cost.“

“I see our finish.” ~ ‘ -A , _V 2

“Perhaps, but there will be others. in the same

He took out his revolver and looked’ at it.‘ Mr.
Gale now joined them. He held in his handa kind
of club he had, found in the corner of the room; 

“We must make the best stand we can against
those rascals,” he said. “Thev shall reach my
daughter only over my dead body.” 2 «' -

‘ . ‘Jessie was loath to leave her father, but when

he insisted that she should retire from the danger

timeoseieriiged much longer to the three.- At length

fshort and straight, and Mr. Gale and the boys

“We attack you, senors!” cried Domin o in a

pect even less than the natives, and began a back-
ward movement. .

“Senors, I swear we mean you no harm,” said
Domingo again. “Let us go to our rooms in
peace’. We will in no way disturb you.”

“No; you can’t come up here except at the
risk of our lives,” returned Jack.

“The andlady shall hear of this.”

Thus speaking, he turned around, and the
others, taking that as their cue, began to descend
the stairs. The rascals paused at the foot for a
private consultation. Finally, leaving two of the
party at the bottom of the ﬂight _with the candle,
the others returned to the main room of the

ouse.

“What do you suppose will-be their next move?”

_said Will.

“How can I ‘tell? Without ﬁrearms they will
hardly dare- to charge u these stairs, and there
is no other way of reac ing us that I know of,"
replied Jack. \

“They may ascend by way of the windows with
the aid of a ladder.” '

“That’s so; I forgot that. Give Mr. Gale your
revolver and go and watch out of one of the win-
dows. If you see them brin ing a ladder warn
us at once. Two of us will e enough to guard
the stairs in any case, while one at whichever

_win_dow they might plant a ladder could hold

them at bay with a revolver. Go!”..

Will hurried off..to keep watch from one of the .
windows. It was well that he had thought of the

.rascals adopting such-a plan, forthat is just‘

what -they attempted in a little while, thinking
to catch the party on the second floor oﬁ’ their
guard. Will had hardly been ﬁve minutes at the
window before he. saw the sailors, assisttegl thy

house. He ran back to the landing an told in
a whisper what was going on. '

“Stay here with Mr. Gale,” said Jack.

He went to the window from which Will had
been watching, and found that their enemies had
already planted the ladder under it, and were
deciding who should mount ﬁrst. Silva was sent
into the house to direct the two men at the foot
of the stairs to make a bluff at ascending them
in order to hold the attention of the persons the
others expected to take by sur rise. The started
up at once with Silva, as if t ey meant usiness.’
On the outside Domingo went up the ladder ﬁrzt. _

s .
his head appeared above the level of the window
the boy shoved his wgapon in his face, .

“Git or I’ll ﬁre!” he cried. .

Domingo was so startled, as well as taken by
surprise, that he lost his balance and fell back-
ward. He struck Griffen, who was following
him, on the head, and broke his hold. The two
swept Flipper off the ladder in their _fall, and -~
when Jack looked out he saw the three ﬂounder- '
ing on the ground, swearing furiously. Griffenv 1’
was the ﬁrst to recover his feet, and‘ seeing Jaekjh 
looking down he shook his fist at him and ﬂung .‘ ‘
a string of’ imprecations into the air. _ At that‘? ,
moment there was a report of a revolver on the

-landing. Mr. Gale had fired at one of the‘ men

on the stairs, and slightl_y_wounded him.’ 
three rascals retired iprecipitately. Jack leaned ‘_
out of -the window, seized the top of the ladder

,was not disturbed, but they did not believe that
 this inaction on the part of, their foes would last
- ‘ long. They kept a sharp lookout from one bf the
windows and down the. darkstairway. ~ At the end

‘of that time Silvaand the two sailors reappeared
atthe foot of the stairs. This time they had no
light. Griffen shouted up. * ‘ .

H‘‘What do you want?” asked Mr. Gale.

. .1 Hardly had he spoken‘when there was a ﬂash
 and a report, and a charge of buckshot rattled

 - against the wall near Mr. Gale’s head, who for-
 ‘. tunatelyv had been standing alongside‘ the balus-
. V — trade, -instead of on the landing, where-the 'ruﬂ"i-
' ans supposed he was, The moment‘ the gun was

V was no confusion among the defenders, neither
{the bark owner nor _Will having been touched by
the shower of shot. Will, who hadtheirevelover,

.. with a loud cry. ’The two sailors kept on,~and

 missed _Flipper’s head.

 '”j»The next minute‘ he was infthe grasp of that
" scoundrel, and a desperate tussle took place be-
‘ ‘tween them, with the chancesall‘ against the boy,

who was=no match for the brawny sailor. Griﬁin

down his face»from the wound inﬂicted by the

V . The appearance of Jack, however, was likely to
‘ .~.turn the scale of battle against the two sailors.

The .chief trouble was it was too dark to dis-

‘ the inn was reached. The prisoners were taken

,_..from the horses and marched into the house,

Jessie was turned over to one of the two women
at the place, and was conducted away from her

, friends. It made Jack wild to see the poor girl's

“ distress, and to realize that it was quite impos-

' ' sible for him or her father to help her in any way.
Mr. Gale and the two boys were placed in a
‘small room at the end of the house. Only one
of their arms was bound, but one of the natives

'‘ squatted outside on guard. This was the ﬁrst

opportunity they had had since their capture to

Gale. . ' ‘
“If I were you I wouldn’t let on that I had

‘ much, then maybe these fellows will be satisﬁed

-with a small sum. Anyway, an American dollar
is worth twice its value in South America, and I
should think that $1,000 would look like_ a for-
tune to these scallawags.”

 of‘th'e long ride, and they wanted a chance to '

  

.“So do I, but there’s precious, little chance of
such luck coming to us the way matters look.”

At that point’ Domingo appeared, and address-
ing Jack said that breakfast was ready, and they
must walk out to it. They had no objection to
doing that, for the three were very hungry. They
were takeninto the main room of the house, their
other arm released, and then each was tied to
his chair;

After the meal they were ecorted to the room,
and both of their arms tied. Two mattresses
were brought in, and then they were told that
they had better go to sleep, as they would have
no opportunity to get any during the night. The
three took this as an indication that the Journey
further inland would be resumed at dark. As
they were tired and used up after their late ex-
perience they took advantage of the chance to
rest, and slept nearly all day.

Just before sundown they were treated to an-

other fair meal. Jack and Will were ‘led back to

the room, but not Mr. Gale. He was informed by
Griﬁen that he was to be separated from the par-
ty. and would be sent to the town of Barrancas, at
the mouth of the Orinoco, where he would be able
to secure a passage to Georgetown. From George-
town he could get to the United States, where he
could set to ‘work to get together the amount of
the ransom, which had been ﬁxed at $10,000.

As soon as it was dark he was allowed to bid
his daughter a temporary farewell, after which
he set off in‘ charge of Silva for the Orinoco. The
two boys did not learn that the bark owner had
parted company with them until they were
brought outside to resume the journey westward,
then they saw that he and Silva were not with
the party any longer. Jack called Domingo over
and asked him about the absence of Mr. Gale.

“It is not the young senor’s business what ‘has

become of the other prisoner,” he replied, shortly."

‘ “Perhaps you’l1 tell us where you are taking us
to?” asked Jack. . ,
“You will learn in good time,” was all the sat-
isfaction he got. ,
The journey was then continued as before, and
only one short stop was made during the night.
In the morning the boys saw a broad stream of
water in the distance. Jack asked Flipper what
river it was.

“It's the Orinoco, my hearty,” he answered, V

“and if Sam and me has our way you and your
pal will be pitched into it with a stone around
your feet.”

‘He eyed Jack with a look of malice, and the
_ boy did not feel like asking him any more ques-

tions. They lost sight of the river soon after.
After several days of steady traveling the party
entered the mountains through a deﬁle, and ﬁn-
ally came to a halt before anotherinn which stood

beside the road that crossed the range. It was 
only a small building, but there were outhouses j - .
and a stable attached to it. All around the im- "

mediate neighborhood were pockets of arable land

under cultivation, and half a dozen men were at

work in these little ﬁelds. . .
The boys noted the fact that Domingo seemed

well acquainted with the people at this ‘house, and '_
when dinner was ready. and all hands, including
the ﬁeld laborers, satdown to,,it, he appeared to_

' be’ on terms of intimacy with everybody.-

at‘ this meal. ‘In

     

the two boys had not seen her since’ their arrival‘

at the mountain inn when she was led away by a

T woman whom Domingo called to take charge of
her. After dinner Jack and Will were taken out-
side and tied to a tree, one on one -side and the
other on the opposite side of the trunk. In this
position they could not see each other, but they
could talk by turning their heads.

“llwonder what is next on the programme?”
remarked Will, who had grown resigned to their
hard circumstances.

_ “If I was a mind reader .I might be able to tell
' you, but as I’m not I know no more about their
-intentions than you do,” answered Jack.

 W ' “The crowd are around the door holding a pow-i

wow over something,” said Will, who faced in that
direction. - ’ .

' “Maybe they are decidingon our fate.” .

. “I don’t see why thev took the trouble to bring
us all the Way here if their object was to do us
up. A clip on the head after they captured. us at
the inn would have put us ‘to’ sleep for good, and
a hole dug by a spade would have completed the
work for good.” —

'‘‘That was the plan the sailors wanted to adopt_

with me, at any rate, but it was turned down by
Domingo. I would like to know what they have
"done with Miss Gale. I dare say they’ll treat her
all right, as they expect to make money out of
her; but it will be some time before her father
_can get the ransom to the rascal. He will prob-
ably have to return to New York to raise it, and
then he’ll have to come back to this, country with
it. Altogether the girl will, be a prisoner for
ionic, time. I wish we couldaescape and rescue

“There is no chance of our doing either.”,

  ii At that juncture aloud shout rose from the.

crowd. _ .
7 “What are the rascals doing now?” asked Jack.
“They are coming this way, and that's a sign
they are going to attend to us.”
. [In a few minutes the tree where the boys were
 ‘. _,atied was surrounded by more than ‘ a dozen

there stood a ladder nearby communicating
through a good—sized hole with a loft which was
‘lighted by the opening above the door, and by
another opening at the other end which the boys,
of course, could not see.

There was a table in the room, and shelves
around the wall,’ and rough stools, evidently of
native manufacture, as \-:e.i as barrels and ham-
pers ranged about, which Jack suspected was the
« argo the craft carried. There was no sign of any
human beings, howevc-1', and the boy wondered if
they were asleep in the loft. Before venturing to

’ see what was there the boys inspected the lower
part ﬁrst. To their great satisfaction they found
a cask full of fresh w-.;t:~ri~, and a hamper full of
provisions, such as rice cakes. a brown_ locking
bread, part of 2. roasted pig, and a plentiful sup-
ply of fruit, some of it not yet quite ripe.

“Here’s luck!” cried Will. “We won’t starve
with all this to feed on.”

He sampled a slice of pig and ate a rice cake,
an example followed by Jack. They were not very
hungry, having had a good meal at the inn before
their enemies started in to dispose of them in the
manner already described. Hanging on the wall
xhey saw an old Cutlass, which had come from
some warship. On one of the shelves lay 'a navy

evolvcr in its leather holster or sheath, and be-
side it abox heaping full of cartridges. .Jack
L~')Ol( possession of the revolver and ﬁlled his pock-
ets with cartridges. An examination of the weap-
on showed that every chamber was already loaded.

“Say, I’ll bet the people who belong to this

craft are asleep upstairs,” said Will. “This boat .

' \~.rouldn’t be deserted‘ in this shape, with cargo and
irovisions enough for a cruise aboard. It doesn't
ook reasonable.” r
, “I agree with you.
7 . aboard they are certaiiily taking things ea‘ . One
‘ of them ought ‘to be awake looking out for the
boat,” said Jack. “It might go ashore somewhere

if it wasn’t kept in the middle of the stream.”

“I didn't see any rudder in the stern where we.

came on board,” said Will. “How do you suppose
this craft is controlled?”

“See those two long poles forward?” said Jack,
pointing through the door. “If the boat gets, too
close to either bank the navigators can fend off
with themtill a sweep _of the tide carries the craft
out into the stream again.” _ V

“I see,”'replied Will. “Well, let’s take a peep
upstairs. I’ll slip up and look. If the people are
there I’ll hold up my ﬁngers, showing how many
there are of them. If it should happen that the

., 5 .' boat is really deserted, so much the better for us.

’ We’ll boss the craft to suit ourselves.”

» “I have an idea you won’t find anybody there,”
—‘ said Jack, almost conﬁdently. ‘

“What makes you think so?” ‘

“Because we've already‘ made noise enough
around here to awaken most any sleeper, and the
natives of this country are generally easily
aroused, for the have good ears, better than the
average civilize person.” ‘

3 “Then how do youi account for the boat being
 ‘adrift without its crew?” '_
 “It might have brokenloose frorniits moorings
‘ ~_«_ while thepeople were all ashore attending to some
- " business,” replied Jack.
ii . *'f1jiat’.s so,” agreed Will;:

::If they are I hope they won’t catch up with ‘it.”"""
If they can’t catch this lumbering craft they’ree
worse than snails. We’re traveling as slow as
molasses from a bunghole.” ' 
With more conﬁdence than before thathe would ‘\
ﬁnd the loft empty, Will mounted the ladder and "’
poked his head through the hole in the ceiling-

light for him to see the interior of the loft pretty I

“Then there’s.nob=ody up there?” ,«

He let go his hold on the floor and tumbled back i.

CHAPTER XI.—Up Against A. Snake.

i “What in thunder is the matter with you, 
Will?f’ cried Jack, extricating himselffrom.his”'
c_ompanion.’s struggling body.  t '  
“Oh; my, let's get away from this boat as  ' « '
as we can,” cried Will, making a break for the 
forward door. _ , “
Jack looked after him in astonishment. 
“What could he have seen up there that startled -
him so?” he asked himself. ‘(He said there wasno C“ i
one up there. I must take, a’ look myself.” i  "-
He placed one foot on the lower rungof the,
ladder and was’ about to spring up, when some"
strange kind of object glided to the edgeof the;
trap and Jack found himself looking into a pair" 
of scintillating eyes. The head in which the eyes
were imbedded, like a pair of glittering diamonds, j
slipped forward and hung down, swinging to and ’
fro with a sinuous motion. It was a goodlthirigf
for the plucky boy that hedid not ose his ﬁre’
ence of mindunder thﬂbaleful gla e of the run
canny live thing abo;:‘e' or it.would have been all
up with him in short order. . _  ,
He saw at once that the object was the head "of " 5
a huge snake, such as inhabit the wilds of‘ certain. a
parts of Venezuela, and he knew if the reptile,
reached him itwould mean his ﬁnish. He jumped,
back from the ladder as quickly as he could and
retired as far as the table. Will, by this tithe;
was perched as far forward as he ucouldgo, slfii
ering at the recollection of what he had just seen‘ .
in the loft. . , ‘ » _ . " _ g
The snake was clearly bent’ on following J ackls -'
movements, for it lowered its neck and a. sedtionr
of its round body through the hole, and turning

“Suppose itcomes down in the dark, how are i

“That's something, but still I don’t like the idea

_ wilderness, and if weshould leave the boat we’d-

surely starve. Between two evils I 'think_the “
snakeis the lesser one since we are armed and '
able to protect ourselves.” _ i .

The boys got a couple of stools and sat down
near the door inside of the room. While_they con-
tinued to_ converse they kept their eyes on the . ,
opening at the top of the ladder. They also ,
watched the two doors, forlit was not‘ unlikely 3
that the snake might let itself out by way of one o
of the small windows at either end of the house, J
Jack was cool and collected,’ but Willwas mani-
festly-nervous. The boys talked over what they
had gone through since they started, out of ‘
Georgetowneharbor on that ‘unlucky sail ~which [ 4

, had ended in their being castaway on the Vene‘- ‘

‘fWell,' we won’t whistle till we’re out of the
woods. Our prospects at present look kind of
dubious.” .

“ I don’t agree with you. I think they are quite
bright, leaving the snake out of the matter.”

“But we can’t leave the snake out. We’ve got
to count on him giving us a lot of—oh, Lord!
There -he is now at the back door.” ‘

Will nearly fell off his stool as he spoke. Jack

1‘ saw the snake hanging down, evidently from the
. little window astern, and poking its head in at
‘ the open _door.

. “Don’t run, Will,” he said. “If you’ve got the
nerve we can trap him now before he gets in
here.”

“How?” asked Will.

“I_’m going to run over quick and slam the
door on his neck. That will leave his head inside.
Then you can cut it to pieces with the cutlas.”

Jack saw that no time was to be lost if that
maneuver was to be carried out successfully. He
made a quick dash for the door before the snake
had slid any further out of the window, and as
the reptile made a dart at him he pushed the door
against its neck and held it with all his strength.

“Quick, Will, now is your time, before it gets
away from me,” he shouted.

Will advanced gingerly and made a cut at the
snake’s head. He missed it.

“Get closer. Don’t be afraid. Work quick or he

may get away,” said Jack, who;wasn’t sure he_

could hold the door tight against the slippery and
squirming reptile. ‘ “
Will made another blow at the’ snake and this

' time inflicted a bad cut on its head. It hissed so

and shot out its forked tongue that Will fell back.
“‘?Get at it again or come here and hold the
door.”

Will was clearly afraid of tackling the snake
even when it was in his power. He seized hold of
a heavy crate and shoved it against the end of the
door, thinking to crush the snake between the
edge of the door’ and the jamb, but it didn’t work.
It held the snake fast, however, and gave Jack a
chance to get busy. He drew his revolver and
put ﬁve bullets into the reptile’s brain, which
settled its hash for good.

“That’s the end of Mr. Snake,” said Jack in a

- tone of satisfaction.

Its head was reduced to a «mere bleeding pulp,

“Lord, how glad I am!” cried Will. “I’ll never
forget this experience as long as I live.”

They waited for an hour, and as the sun was
setting. Jack pulled the crate away and opened
the door. The snake was limp and’ lifeless. It was
all out of the window land was a monster, capable
of squeezing a bullock to death easily. With the

W - aid of one of the poles they managed to push the

body over into the river, and when it disappeared

W . beneath the surface with a splash the boys felt

that an incubus had been lifted from their minds.
Ten minutes afterward darkness fell over the

landscape, but the sky was so brilliant with stars
that they could see some distance ahead down the y
' river. The lantern was lighted, and then they

had their supper. They sat talking. awhile, chieﬂy

At thistime the OrinocoCwas passing through

gthﬂt he: determined to run over and take a look
' atit. The distance was not far, and he felt sure
that he could get back before the storm burst up-
on them. Accordingly he jumped ashore and

' ~ started for the tree. ' * l,’
,»'7" As he approached it he saw that it was but ‘a
hollow’ shell,‘ the ‘whole interior having decayed
after. the trunk had been split open, in all prob-
,‘ I ability by a thunderbolt. The shiny object proved
 to be. merely the bleached interior which had been
_ worn smooth and white by the weather, giving it
a spectral effect in the gloom, and under the lurid
gleam of the lightning. Hardly had Jack ascer-
tained that fact than the storm swooped down
 with such terriﬁc force that he dared not return
to the boat, but decided to take shelter inside the
great hollow tree, so he stepped inside. ‘
" It was at that moment that Will was aroused
bya tremendous crash. He sat up and looked
. around him, and was astonished to ﬁnd the loft
‘wrapped in darkness. A tremendous pounding
‘sound camefrom the roof which the boy soon
I realized was made by a fearful downpour of rain.
As hefrubbed his eyes a vivid flash of lightning lit
~ up Vev'e1"y corner of the loft for a moment, and
another awful crash shook the stranded boat from
' stem to stern’. Will, however, ‘was not aware that
‘- the boat was no longer moving down the Orinoco,"
but ashore on the bank of a branch stream a
jtjuarter of a mile from its mouth. The glare of
..~the lightning showed Will that he was alone. _,
 "fThe storm must have aroused Jack, and he‘ has
" one downstairs,” he thought. “It’s a corking
, 'eavy one. Gee! what a ﬂash!” .
 '.Th‘e ﬂash was followed as before by a tremen-
» dons peal. — _ _ _
 A“I,.thoug,ht the roof was falling in that time.
'I’ll.lgo' down and see what Jack is doing.”
 -1 Hg crawled over to the ladder and looked
' down through the opening. For the moment he
could ‘see nothing, though both doors were par-
* tially open, so intense was the darkness, then the
lightning lit up the room and he saw every corner
of it. To his surprise Jack was not there.
_ “Why; where could he have gone?” he asked
himself. “Helis not up here, and if he isn’t

' “Good Lord, we are ashore!” he gasped.

him to account for it. He was frightened, too,
at the ﬁerceness of the storm, for he feared that
a thunderbolt might strike the boat and destroy
it, in which case he would surely perish himself.
He 1-etiredgto a corner and huddled up likean.
animal overcome by terror. There he remained
for a whole hour while the storm raged like
legions of ﬁends on the rampage. Gradually it
worked off to the northwest, and the sky lightened
up. The worst over, Will got up, feeling like a
wreck, and went to the door again.

“I don’t see where he could have gone to,” said
Will, more uneasy thanever. “Surely he could
not have fallen into the river and been borne
away. If he were anywhere within half ‘a mile
I am sure I could see him. I can’t imagine any
reason that would have taken him off the boat
 that storm. I never felt so lonesome in all my
1 e.
ﬁnish, too. I, couldn’t go on alone to save my
life. The boat is stranded anyway, and that set-
tles the trio down the river. The Orinoco seems
to have got mighty narrow all at once. It-doesn't
look like the‘ .same river.”

He walked dispiritedly back into the cabin and,
seating himself _on one of the stools,‘ gave him-
self up to gloomy forebodings about the future.
Fifteen minutes passed away and then there came’
the sound of steps outside. He looked up and saw
Jack step ing up to _the door. . He..sprang up
and rushe to meet him. ‘ ‘ .

“Where in creation-have you been, Jack?” he
cried. “I have been worried to death almost over
your mysterious absence. I couldn’t make out
where you had gone.” ’ ,

“Oh, I woke up‘a couple of hours ago, just be-
fore the storm came on, and discovered that we
had gone ashore somewhere up on a branch
stream of the Orinoco.” ’ x.

' “Where were you during the storm?”

“On share.”

“And didn't you get wet?” .

“I don’t look as if I did, do I?”

“No. Where did you ﬁnd shelter? I only saw
one dead tree insight, and that wouldn't shelter
a person as thin as a walking stick from such a
tempest.” /

“I was in the snuggest place in the world,
where the storm didn't bother me at all. _When
I,tell~ you everything you’ll open your eyes pretty.
wide. I left this boat as poor as Jcb’s turkey;
now I’m a sort of Monte-Cristo.

“What are you talking about?”

“Think I’ve suddenly turned lightheaded?”
grinned Jack. o 3

“I think you’re talking rag-time. Explain
yourself. What do you mean by saying you are
now a kind of Monte Cristo?”

*‘‘Because I’m worth lots of monéy—'-loads ‘off

CHAPTER XIII.—Jack’s Story.

_ “I told you that luck might come our way again,
and there is the evidencevof it.”
_ Thus speaking, Jack took a handful of gold
win from his pocket -and exhibited it before the
» astonished eyes of his friend-
“Where in creation did -you ﬁnd that money?”
‘cried Will. . , e
“In a cave near here, and if there isn’t all
of $100,000 there I shall be surprised.”
“A hundred thousand!” exclaimed Will.
.“Every dollar of it,” replied Jack inra positive
tone. I
“I.
Will.
“No, I’m not. Well, there are six boxes of
those yellow boys besides a lot of silver ingots in
the cave I tumbled into.” . i
' “Six boxes full of them! How big are the
-boxes?” asked the amazed Will.
‘ Jack indicated the size. ’
. "Gosh! What a lot of money!.
there are silver ingots besides?”

guess you're stretching things, Jack,” said

And you say.

I “ uite a"pile of them.”

“How did that stuff get there?” _

.‘j“’I*Iow should I know?” ‘
f“Where is the cave?”

“Right opposite here.”

“How -came you to tumble into it? It must be
underground at that rate?” '

“The entrance to it is through the trunk of a
hollow tree near a big rock which you -can see’
from the door. The tree lookswas if it's been

 »dead fora very long time, probably killed by. a ,

' thunderbolt, which doubtless toreopenthe trunk.
-. ‘I was over, there when the storm came up, and’
~ V I stepped into the tree to avoid getting wet if pos-
' sible; Before I knew what was going to happen
 I? fell through a.hole.and landed nearly a dozen

V/I "feet below the surface allin a heap._ My first

knew that if I couldn’t get out I could see my

"‘Where’s the money?” he asked. ’
Jack pushedahead a few feet and then ﬂashed
the lantern into a sort of alcove. There were
sixjboxes full of Spanish geld coin, and the pile
of silver wedgesiready for the mint. I ’ g
. “Lift one of the boxes and you will see that
though pretty heavy still, it is not too heavy for ,

weight. .“We’llxhave.tO put new covers on them“

“We'll count the ~.pieces, but we’ll have to esti'- T,

. of their actual wortl1,”i said -Jack. - .

-‘ .Accor-c‘lingly they coun-ted thenumberv of coin

in one-of the‘ boxes and found there were 1,500
‘of them; They estimated that the six boxes footed
-up between $90,000 and $100,000. v The silver;
-wedges were smill and-molded all of one size. 
‘The boys -could form no clear idea of their value ..
as the‘y‘stood,,tho'ugh theyestimated each at
about thirty pounds of bullion. On that basis,
afterconnting the ingots, they judged there was " >
over half a ton of silver in the lot. After they
had satisﬁed their curiosity concerning the treas-

ure they found a hatchet and a box of nails.

‘ “These will come in handy in building-the‘? ‘
raft,” said Jack. T y y T ,
' Aftera good breakfast next morning ‘they set ‘
to work on .the raft without delay. Thus they
put in several days, without seeing a"‘soul in all
that time, and then they had the raft completed;
though they were not ‘sure 'it would sustain all,
the weight they wished. to trust to it. Nothing
remained now but to Da{'i< the treasure securely
and. transfer it tr: the raft. They used the pro,-,
vision boxes to hold the ingots, and piled a portion

of the provisions wherever‘ they could ﬁnd a
place for the stuff»; leaving the rest in the cave. , /
All being rsadygthey trusted their deeply laden
craft to the tide of the stream early one morning,’
With,
the aid of a "pole they managed to steer their.
craft into the big river, and the current catching ., ,

it they began their slow sail down the stream; ,‘

Three days. later, after passing severalssmall
towns and-’ villages, they'reached', Barrancas, at
the l'I'10lJtl'l_'0f the river. . Leaving Will in charge as
of the raft, Jack, with his pockets full of Spanish 
gold pieces, stepped ashore to try and make ’ar- 
rangements for the transportation of themselves » J.
and their treasure outof Venezuela. He found’ .
a large schooner about _to sail for Georgetown, T
and had no difficulty in coming to terms with her - . f
skipper, who was an Englishman. . The treasure s
was taken aboard the craft and placed in the

' V ,, so! ’ That’s so!” came from nearly a
of ‘honest old farmers in the courtroom.

ﬁceu, — “The law is, that hearsay evidence can-
atibe received in any court in the State. I my-

+391‘: believe in the truthfulness of the witness, for
" ';;1gav‘é;‘lgnown him all of his life’, and would ‘take

Every individual in the courtroom laughed

evidence“, and itwas then that theijustice put the
question to Jimmy, as to whether he believed the-.
truth of his friend’s story. ’ 4 .
' “I dorbelieve. your honor,” repeated the boy, '

“Oh, said the judge, “that’s not hearsay evi-
dence. for the witness swears that he saw the
stolen sheep in the possession of the defendant,”
and then the wrangle between the two lawyers en-
sued as to the truthfulness of Truthful James '
himself when he declared that he had seen the
stolen sheep in the possession of the defendant. ,'

Now, Truthful, James was a ,youth of about .
nineteen years of age, whose veracity no one who _
knew him had the hardihood toquestion, and was
a rollicking boy of undaunted courage, being the,
son of a poor widow who owned a little home and’

‘a few acres-of land on the roadside leading to
Jonesboro. The land was poor, yet Jimmy was so M
industrious that he was able to double the produc-
tion of it, and he was often heard to say there was -
more in the man than in the land, and the few
acres which his mother owned proved the truth-
fulness of his assertion.‘ He was never known‘ to
buy a. ton of fertilizer for his mother’s land, say- A .
ing that it was not at all necessary. '

The young lawyer, of course, appealed from the
decision of the court on the ground that evidence
of guilt was lacking, and when the case came to
trial on the appeal, Truthful James was present-
When one of the lawyers spoke of himas Truth-
ful James, he said to the court that that was not '
his name, it being James Watson. w ‘ 

“Well, don't you answer to that name?” the ~
court asked. —

“Yes, your honor, but I don’t claim it. I do-’
claim, however, that I never told a lie in my life ;:
that is, knowingly.” . V  ',

‘‘Didn’t you ever tell a falsehood in a spirit of.
humor?” the court asked. »,- ‘ ”

“No, your honor. I have never been able to see

I any humor in a falsehood.”

“What! Did vou never see/a chance to raise '3. 4. ' ’
laugh by straining the truth in making a state- ‘
ment?” ’ 2 _~ .

“No, sir. That would be straining my con-
science, and I’ve never been able to see any humor’
in that.” ' - ,

“Well, you’re the ﬁrst man this court haseverv
seenwithout humor of that sort, and I congratu—. , .
late myself on‘ hearing a witness make such’fa, w 2
statement. I Now. the court would asklyou a ques-‘ ,, g
tion as to the quilt or innocence. of the defen’dant’~ _r 
in this case. Do vou think he is guiltyyof having"
stolen the sheen?" V

“Your honor, I, saw the stolen sheep in the pos ».
session of the defenda_nt..and it is u, to. you to

 

I ,say‘wheth_er_ or not ‘that was anyevi ence of his ’ 

guilt. [would not like to sit in‘ judgment on my , ; «

which I should not object. ’ Ever since that time
I have considered it an honor,” he went on. ,
“Is this the ﬁrst case in which you ever testi-

ﬂed?”

“No, sir, it is not. Four or ﬁve years ago I was
called on to tell what I knew about a certain case
over which two of our neighbors were quarrel-
ing, and when I was called on my mother asked
me what I was going to say. I told her I was sim-

- olv going to tell the truth, and I did. The son of

one of the parties undertook to thrash me for it,
and I believe it was he who got the thrashing in-
stead of me. He never would acknowledge it, but
I knew that it was so, for he yelled enough to let
me know.” I ,

“That's good evidence,” laughed the judge, the
court joining in the laugh with him.

One evening he ‘attended a corn-husking at the
home of a neighbor living three miles from his

own home. and of course there were quite a lot of '

bovs more or less under the inﬂuence of strong
drink. One of the boys, named Henry Halstead,
claimed that J immv Watson had‘. taken three
drinks of whisky from his jug that night. Jim-
my denied it most emphatically,‘ and young Hal-
stead persuaded Sallv Holmes, his sweetheart, to

corroborate his story and claim, that she saw.

Jimmy turn up the jug three times and take
copious drinks from its contents.

Now, Sally Holmes was the ve1'y popular
daughter of a neighbor of ‘good reputation; but
when Jimmy Watson was told that she had said
she: saw him take three drinks of whisky from
young Halstead’s jug, he said:

,“I won’t say Sallv is a liar, but ,I will say that
the statement is untrue.”

Several of the young men chuckled, and one re-
marked:

“Well, there is quite a difference,” said Jimmy. .

“One would be a very harsh expression which I
would not use in speaking of a young lady whom
I would not call a liar under any circumstances.”

marked that there was no difference. "

CHAPTER II. _
How One Lie Brought on Another Fight. " -H

 
   

Both the boys were plucky, and allythe boys f .
the party knew that Jimmy Watson’s feroci
could notibe equaled. and in less time than it takes
to tell it they were furi.ously pounding each other.‘
The bystanders pitched in to prevent a fight", but
no harsh expressions were used. although‘ ‘many- 
hard blows were exchanged. ‘ A «’ 5-

Several times Tom demanded to know of Jim- “
my_ if he meant to call him a liar. . -  q

“I mean Just what I say,” repeated Jimmy,', {E
“that when you say you heard Miss Sally remark ..
that she saw me take a drink of liquor from that: . 1';
Jug you speak falsely, for no one can make me” .
believe that Shv lied that way herself.” * '- -

By that time the_ boys had stopped the progress;
of the ﬁght, and Jimmy still strenuously insisted .
that he wasn’t charging Miss Sally with having
lied, and was defending her good name as a ‘'
truthful girl by sayingthat he didn’t believe she ‘ 
said anything of the kind. ~ '~ _. ’-

“Boys, that puts. a different light on the mat’-‘ .
ter,” said one of Ji-mm_V’s friends. ‘ '

“Of course it does.” said Jimmy. “But some of ,
you fellows don't seem to have sense enough ‘to -. 
understand it.” i *- f 

“Well,” ,said another one who was anxious to *7
see the ﬁght go on, “I guess I am about as well’ 
able to understand the English language as any’ 

  

 

“Well, you.don_’t,” retorted Jimmy, “if you say

She didn’t say anything of the kind, and thestory. 3.‘.
is false. I can lick, too, the one who says it .is‘_not:‘-

Then another hot exchange of blows followed. '
between Jimmy and those who maintained thatj '
was true. , " 4-

There were enough of the boys in the party to
prevent’ any one from‘ being injured. 

“See here, Jimmy,” called out one of his friends,‘
“here’s another fellow who says he heard -Mus‘ 5
Sally corroborate the story.” ', - ‘  M '

.“Well, my reply takes him in also,” returned.
Jimmy. “If all the boys in town should sa_Y.t,h3t"
they heard Miss ‘ .ally say I was drinking Lwould
make each and every one the same reply. “I new:
told a lie, knowingly, in my‘ life, and stand ready
to maintain my reply as long as I have strength
to do so, and I'll add to it that every one of you

“Then you mean to call me a liar, too,” put .1
Jack Whaley, who was known in the neighborhou
as a,pretty tough youth. ‘ I I ' ‘

“What’s the matter up the street?”

“Man found dead sir.”

“Wasn’t murdered?”

“Guess not.”

“Who was he?” .

“Old Laforge, sir, him as lived in the third
house from the corner.”

“Laforge?” '

“Yes, sir; what used to be rich and lost his

V money, and took to drinking and licked his wife-—

that’s him.”

“And he’s been found dead?”

“I guess they’ll let me in; I was an old friend
of his.”

The above conversation took place between my-
self and a lad about fourteen one morning in one
of the by-streets of this busy city of New York.

I was strolling along quietly, when I saw a
crowd gathered in front of a house, and sus-
pecting lsomethinghwabs wrong, questioned the boy
as to w at it mig t e.

" Poor Laforge!  had known him well, and be-
fore he tooklto drink he had been an able man.

I knew his history almost as well as I knew

.my own, and, ’before I go on, I might as well

I give an outline of it, as it will be of use in fol-
o

wing the thread of my story, enabling the
reader to better understand what follows.

‘Pierre Laforge was a Frenchman and a de-
signer by profession, who had lived in this coun-
try ,several years, and was married.

For a_ time he appeared to be very happy, and

an of his named Durand.
I noticed that urand was particularly at-
than old acquaintance warranted.

I said’ nothing to Laforge about it, of course,
and so the thing went on.

After a‘ while I lost track of the inan and
learned that he had taken to drink, lost his work,

' and \ as rapidly going from bad to worse.

I used to see Durand a good deal after "that,
and he seemed to prosper as Laforge sank

’ deeper into adversity

Then I somehow learned the two men played

I cards a good deal, and that in some way or an-

other the designer was always the loser.
-, Then a third party appeared upon the scene
'in the form of a man of whom I had my suspi-

thougli he purported to be a commercial traveler.
‘His name was Andre, and upon several oc-

A A casions he had been detected in swindling, though
- lie always, with great adroitness, managed to
‘nescapearrest, throwing the blame upon some

one else.  ~

.. ; One night, about a month before the morning

hat ‘I heard Laforge w‘as dead, ‘I visited a notor-
::ious,gambling"den', _in ‘disguise, for the purpose

To my astonishment I discovered the three ~

too, Laforge seeming to be the loser.- * --

At last when Laforge had lost all his money

 

drank so much, Andre proposed a new

I saw Andre slyly ﬁll up his half-emptied glass, . _

“If you win, you get ﬁve hundred dollars; jf
either of ‘us win, we get the lady.” . ”
“I cannot stake my wife in this way,” said 
Laforge. V _ ‘W pi,

The speechwas interrupted by Andre’s sud-
denly springing upon’ the other and seizing him
by the throat.

Then I saw the gleam of a dagger, and before
I could interfere it was buried beyond the guard
in the neck of the man Durand.

The other dropped the knife and turned, with-
out looking at the bodyof the murdered man, to
seek safety in ﬂight.

I was at his side in a moment, and, seizing him
by the collar, pressed the muzzle of my revolver
to his temple, telling him not to stir or I would
kill him upon the spot.

He tried to escape, but ﬁring a shot close to
his ear in order to terrify him and. bring as-
sistance, at the same time I clapped a pair of
handcuffs upon him and hurried him off.

Two policeman came running to the spot, and
quickly explaining the situation I delivered my
prisoner to them and went back to ﬁnd the
wounded man.

He was stone dead.

Andre was tried, for the murder of Durand and
admitted hisguilt, setting up as his defense that
the other had’ called him a coward and struck’ the
first blow."

My testimony destroyed his ‘defense, and at
last the man confessed his guilt and was sen-
tenced to be hanged.

He would say nothingabout the Laforge aﬁair,
except to deny that he had committed the murder.
though he might be considered an accessory.

It was impossible to get any information out
of him or whether he had any accomplices. ,

Madame Laforge had ﬂed, where it was not
known, and ,the most thorough search failed to
reveal her place of hiding.

At last, upon the gallows, Andre admitted that
he had not actually strangled Laforge, but had
hired‘ the hideous deed done, superintending all
the arrangements, and watching the assassin do

. his work.

'Laforge had lately come into some money,‘
quite unexpectedly, and it was to obtain this that
he was to be’ put out of the way.

It was some time after the execution of Andre,
whose real name was discoveredto‘ be Dubourg,
that a Frenchman‘ was reported to have been
dangerously wounded in an uptown gambling
saloon. I .

It was said that he was delirious at the hos-
pital, and. that he said stran e things; among‘
others, scraps of sentences re ating to the La- ‘
forge murder. ‘

J went to the hospital at once, and saw him.

He was asleep, but talked incessantly, and I soon I

gathered enough to convince me that he was the
man whom Dubourgh had hired to kill Laforge.

When he became calm, I read to him a trans-
cript of the things he had said in his frenzy. 1'.

« ﬁrst he denied all knowledge of the affair, but as

he grew weaker, and saw that there was no
chance of his living, he retracted the denial.

He confessed the whole aﬁair, and said further A

that -Madame Laforge was a party to the plot,
and that she had‘ fled to Holland, between which

country and our own there was no treaty of ex- 

tradition.

He soon died, and so cheated the gallows, and 

that -eneded the affair, the wife of the murdered

_ man never returning to this country. , k "

BOWLING HAS BEEN EVOLVED OUT OF

MANY ANCIENT GAMES

. . American bowlers, it is estimated, number more
' than a million; their season of sport is now at its
height. To any one but a bowler, the crash of
ﬂying pins means nothing but noise; to a bowler
it means enjoyment of a game that is rapidly

« , assuming the proportions of a major sport.

' .In its early. forms, bowling was a crude affair,
played on any space available. Stones were used
for balls. No Work on rounding-the stones was
alone—-—they were usedin their natural and often-

 times lopsided forms. Strutt, in his “Sports and
. ‘Pastimesof the People of England,” traces the

-- game back to the Middle Ages. He also says
, that the inconveniences of the bumpy, open
- , glzieens suggested the‘ idea of more level wooden
i .a eys. ~

‘ Of the many ancient games from which,bow1-
in is supposed to have come, ninepins is prob—
ab y more closely allied than any other. It was
a Dutch game, played with nine pins, set up in

. diamond form. In 1723 Dutch settlers were

_ known to have ‘bowled on an open green in lower

A New York, now known as Bowling Green. New

. . rules necessitated the addition of another pin to
; .the_nine pins and‘ changing the diamond set-up

‘ to ‘triangular form.

Closh, clossynge or cloish are also forms of the

_ninepin game from which bowling is said to have

. .,been adopted. Curling, a Scotch game, and skit-
tles, an English game, in which disks are used,
are also said to have been bases for‘ bowling.

' [First attempts at organization of bowling were

  made in 1875,,when twenty-seven representatives,

of nine clubs met to draw up new rules for the

game’. The National Bowling Association failed,

as did its successor, the American Amateur Bowl-
i ing Union. In 1895, the American Bowling Con-
' ' gress was formed.

   

' ‘DUTCH ORIGIN OF MAIDEN LANE’S‘NAME
PROVED BY OLD COURT RECORD
' OF CABBAGE THEFT THERE

. At'a luncheon of the Maiden Lane Historical
,  Siciety of the Chamber of Commerce of the State
 of New York recently, where thetrustees of the
Museum of the City of New York were special
guests, a Maiden Lane .tablet was dedicated by
the society. ' .
‘ “The inscription on the‘ Maiden Lane tablet
tells us that in ‘the days when .Peter Stu esant
. stumped about the town on his wooden eg and
<— closed up the night. clubs at 9 o’clock Maiden
Lane was known as ’T ‘Maagde Paatje, the
Maiden’s Lane, a lovers’ lane located outin» the
_ country beyond Wall Street’s wooden wall,” said
' Albert Ulmann, historian of the society. A
 A’ “Having gathered these facts and duly pre-
A pared them for the tablet, a doubt ‘was thrown
upqnthe correctness of,the statement. It was

REPORT ON INTERVENTION READY AT
HAVANA ,

A report recommending that a declaration of

the fundamental principles of international law

ybepassed by the Pan-American Congress, includ--

»ing a general denunciation of unprovoked inter'— »
vention by one State in the internal affairs of an-_- -
other, -has been prepared by Dr. Victor Maurtua

of Peru for presentation to the Committee on
Public International Law for which ‘ he is re-
porter. -.

D_r. Maurtua said recently that his recomm‘en-‘I
dations would advocate in general terms the rec-

ognition of de facto governments»

A ﬂat unqualiﬁed statement that intervention A
in the internalaffairs of another country was ,

prohibited, Dr. Maurtua said, was not in accord- .
Espe- .

ance with modern juridicial conceptions.
cially since The I-Iauge proceedin s and the
League of Natons had spread so wi ely the con-

ception of international interdependence under»
which national sovereignty is no longer the un- -

assailable quality it was once.

DOGS “FLAG” TRAIN TO SAVE MASTER

G. C. Clark, Wadena, Ia., farmer, owes his life t .

to his dog pals, Treve and Freckles. Overcome

by a heart attack recently while walking down the V ,0

Milwaukee‘ Railroad tracks several miles from his -

home, Clark fell unconscious between the rails.

Treve sat down beside his body to see that no i »

harm came 14 it. while Freckles clashed madly up
the track. Awuarter of a mile away a train ap-
peared. Freckles created such a commotion that
George Craft, ﬁreman, warned William Luther,
his engineer, that he feared there was danger
ahead. . » ’

Luther slowed down his train until he saw an
object dead ahead. When he brought his train
to a stop,'Treve was still beside the body, and
looking -around to see what had become of

pilot of the engine, panting so that his mouth
seemed drawn back with a grin.

Clark’s body was

in it‘ and sent home.

- Treve and Freckles again sat beside him. When 7

the man was taken inside his home the dogs

ceased their vigilance and started frolicking in the '-

yard.

Treve is a white Scotch collie;. while Freckles is  ’
a coach hourid. Mr. Clark has raised them from‘

pupuvhood and where he goes they go.
