“I don’t see ‘how you did it, anyway.”

“Go and look at him and maybe -you’ll under-. .

At thatmoment the girl appeared at the head . .

of the stairs.

, .“Come~up,” she._.s_aid to Joe.  , -
The boy shouldered hispackage and mounted

the stairs. The girl led him into a back room
ﬁtted up; like a combined library and oﬁice. Its
general aspect was dingy, _,for'the—old-fashioned,
paneled walls and the ceiling were -dark‘ and
somber through age. It sadly needed whitening
and a« coat or two of paint. 0

. The furniture consisted of an .,.o1d-time ‘desk.of 

solid mahogany; a very ancient, square iron zsafe
that a modern burglar could have opened in a
jiﬁy; ‘several. stiﬁ’ back chairs; a solid-looking
sofa; a small.-table on- which stooda lamp» of-.an-
tique design;
walls; a carpet that had ‘long since outlived its
usefulness,;so threadbare was it; a go,od—’siz‘ed
mahogany bookcase ‘filled with rarevand out-.of-
print books, and many ornaments of ‘value. ‘

In the centre of the room stood a premature-
ly aged man. He wore a dressing gown and had
slippers on his feet. This was"Matthe_w- Graves,

and helooked mo:-ev.li'ke the. grandfather: effthe ’

girl‘ he called daughter than her father. Joe
dropped his package and bowed as the. '-rl‘ in-

-troduced him to heri father’ as the»boy~w 0 had
,. saved her from being torn and probably killed

by the watch dog. ,
“I thank you, young man, for the service you
rendered my daughter,”‘he said in measured

tones, “and regret that my poverty prevents me ,

from rewarding you as you deserve.”

“I don’t ask for any reward, sir. I am suffi-
ciently repaid in knowing that I saved your
daughter from serious mgury,” replied Joe. -

iThe girl ﬂashed a look of‘ ratitud ‘a d. - -
terest at him.’ g e n m

“What is your name, young man?” asked"

Graves, regarding the boycuriously.
“Joe Eastwood.” «' l

The girl shook her head vigorously at Joe for
him to decline the offer, but he w_as so eager to
get a position that he did not notice her. _

“I'll take it, sir, and do my best,” he replied.

- The girl looked disappointed and anxious. .

“I believe you are honest,” went on the old.
man.

“I hope so, sir.
of a dishonest action.”

“It is well. Seven clerks have I had during the
last year, and each of them robbed me of a bag
of gold and ﬂed in the night,” said the old man
solemnly. ' . ‘ '
J “Do__you keep your money in that safe?” asked

oe. ' —

“I do.”_

“And you hold the key yourself, don’t you?”

“Surely.”

“How then could they rob you, unless, of

I have never yet been guilty

way?”

“I know not their methods, but this I do know I

——they,robbed me of my gold, and ﬂed.”
“I don’t see how seven of them could have

V. worked the same trick on you,” said Joe, clearly

“Nevertheless, it was done. Seven of them
robbed me. I pray young man, that you may not
be the eighth.” i

“You needn’t worry about that. I wouldn’t
/take your money if you left it in myﬂcharge and
I knew all I had to do was to walk out of the

gate with it. There islnothing gained by dis- ,

honesty,” replied Joe earnestly.

“Well, well then, so be it. As long as you
touch not my gold, but do your business well
we shall“ get on well together.
a large eater?” _

“I have a pretty healthy_ appetite as a rule,”
replied Joe, in some‘ sur rise.

“I regret to hear it. y household expenses
are great and vex me much. My boy of all work,
Jerry Abbot, is a veritable glutton. He does
nothing but eat, eat, eat all day long. I took

‘ him from the poor farm, but I- fear I made a
‘ ‘bad bargain.

I must keep him, for I signed an
agreement to provide for him till he reaches his
twent_v—first birthday. I am sadly afraid that
he will eat me out of house and home before
that time:” _ ,
“I met him in the street a short distance from
here, and he guided me to your house. He does
not look like a glutton, for he's as thin as a rail

1 and has a half-starved k,” said Joe.

“His looks belie him. e eats as much as two
boys ought to. He is not satisﬁed with what I
allow him--a pound of good, wholesome, meat 9.

CHAPTER IV.—Seven Bags of Gold.

On his way back to Flushing Joe pondered
over the singular and mysterious facts connected
with the old house on Oak street, which promised
to be his scene of action for a, while“to come.

The disappearance of the old man’s seven

clerks and seven missing bags ‘of gold puzzled
him not a little. To say the truth, he did not
.put much stock in the ingenious theory he ‘had
advanced to Edith to account for the astonishing
stateof aﬂ’airs. ', . ~

If crooks had learned of Matthew Graves’
wealth and had planned to rob him, it did not

‘strike him that they would make a, piecemeal

job of the matter. '0nce they got at the con-
tents of the safe they would have taken the four-
teen bags while they were about it.

T“There is something out of the common back
of this matter—-something that will stand a sharp
investigation. I should think the old man would
have hired an expert detective to ferret out the
mystery. Of course he may have done so for all
I know to the contrary, but I rather doubt it.
His daughter is very anxious to ﬁnd out the truth
‘of the matter, which is quite natural, and I'll!
help her all I can, for she’s a mighty ﬁne girl.
It’s my opinion her father is a bit light in the

M head. While he talked sane enough‘, there was

something odd about him, That may be due to

.worry over his lost gold. A man worth $70,000

in money at least, and owner of his own house,
has no call to bother about the ainount of, food
his small household consumes. One would think
from the way he put it that hefwas forced to

 skimp owing to lack of funds topay his current

 

‘and on other security. There is some‘ mystery‘

_ “By theAW_aY. I suppose you know an old man‘
in Rye named Matthew Graves?” said'Joe,- who:
thought he’d try and ﬁnd out ‘something about

“Yes. I ought to _know.him. He’s.—lived therea

“What other reason?” . ,- »
“I couldn’t tell you. When Graves reported
loss of his ﬁrst bag of gold and the disappeared
of his clerk, Constable Brown, knowing.t.hat'
clerk came from New York City, reported; it‘
matter to the police authorities of that city,‘
nothing ever came from it. A month later,

the vanishing of another clerk. Brown,

subject of his bags of gold. It is probable that
the first clerk robbed him of a bag of gold and
disappeared during the night Without leavin
trace of his ﬂight behind him. The loss 0 that

bag of gold has doubtless pi.-eyed on his mind and V
i periodically gives birth to the idea that he has
~ been robbed again in the same identical way.”

“I wouldn’t be surprised but you are right,

though his daughter has told me that each time ‘

a clerk disappeared a bag of gold was missing
from the safe.” ‘

“Does she knowithat to be a fact?” asked the
man in some surprise. '

“She does.”

“No one will accuse her of not being right in
the mind,” said the Rye man. “Did she explain
to you how she knew it?” ‘ ‘ '

"And the other four?”  _
“He said it was known throughout the village

old man angrily. “I have been robbed. Seven

where downstairs. Presently he heard slow and

. measured steps in the corridor, the door opened
and‘ Matthew- Graves walked into the room.

_“Good- morning, young man,” he said in. a
friendly» tone. “I hope you passed a pleasant
night.” " , .

Joe thought of the seven clerks who had both-

‘ ered a portion of‘ his sleep, and wasn’t certain

about it. but nevertheless he replied that he had

‘slept all‘ right.

“Breakfast awaits you below,” said: the em-
ployer, walking to his desk- ,,

“All right, sir. Do you. wish me to assist you
downstairs?”

“No. My breakfast is always served to me
here. In fact. I take all my meals in. this room,
for the same must never be left for a moment.un-
guarded.” ' p __ _

“He is certainly crazy on the subject of his
money,” thought_Joe‘ as he walked downstairs.
“How could any one get into that safe, while he’s
at breakfast?” ,

He found Edith in the dining-room waiting for
him. She greeted him with‘ a, smile and a cheer-
ful good morning, which he returned, and taking
her place at the head of the table, she pointed. to
a. chair‘ close to her. The breakfast consisted, of
steak, fried potatoes, hot rolls and coﬁee, and
Joe had no fault to ﬁnd with it. Edith saw he

was bountifully supplied, and" she did not stint.

“Judging from your father’s remarks yester-
dav afternoon, I should imagine he would have
a ﬁt if hexsaw what a good" breakfast we are hav-
ing,” laughed‘ Joe.

“If I followed mv- father’s orders, we would
have very little to eat. and I would not be able to
keep the cook,” she replied. “To hear him talk,
one would think wercouldmot afford to buy enough
of the necessaries of life. You will find‘ that such
is not the case. . I‘ buy what I think is necessary,
and he gives me the money to pay the bills at
the end of the week. He never looks at them,
but he never fails to tell me to be more economical.
Poor father! He has changed greatly since he

“Not through me he won’t,” replied Joe, who
then related such- portions-of his dream as he
could remember. I A

—"I do notbelieve that dreams mean anything?’
she replied. “Your mind was ﬁlled with thoughts
of the seven clerks, and them seven missing bags

‘_‘I guess you're right. I’m not particularly sun-
prised myself that I" had such odd visions.”

After, breakfast Joe took a walk around the
grounds with. Edith for about an hour and at

nine o'clock returned to the room where his em,-‘ ‘

ployer was’. seated? at his desk. He found 9. bhair
and a writing table placed beside one of the win»

dows. There were writing materials on it. Joe’s ' ,
first ‘ob was tocopy--at number’ of documents that‘, " ,

éravesv placed before» him, and the task took W  I
him a couple of hours, during which the old man i

I  fact, I have heard many

I . to threaten to

   

a’c_lock.and he acquitted himself to the satisfaction
The bell then rang for dinner,
and he was told to go down to the dining-room.

The ‘meal was a thoroughly good one, and the
boy was now satisﬁed that there was no danger
of any one in the household suffering from want
of food. Jerry evidently did not tell the truth
when he said. he had not had a square meal in‘ six
months. Just why he looked so skinny and ill-

. fed was a problem to Joe. After dinner Joe had

an hour to himself and he spent it in Edith’s com-
pany. The more he saw of the girl the more she
fascinated him, and it was clear that he was not
ydispleasing to her. He worked from half-past
two until ﬁve and then he was off for the day. On
the whole the job_ was an easy one—-what some
people would call a “pipe,” and he was glad he had
fallen into it. Supper was announced promptly at

six, and when "they werethroiigh Joe and Edith V
went down ‘to the end of the grounds, passed out-

side the wall through a kind of postern gate. and

strolled along the bank of the creektoward the.

Sound. . »

It was dark ,when they returned, and Joe
passed the rest of the evening playing backgam-
mon with the girl in the dining-room. His sleep
was not bothered that night with ‘unpleasant
dreams, and he awoke in the’, morning feeling
quite chipper. During the week that followed Joe
and Edith-had frequent conversations about the
seven clerks and the seven bags of gold. The
girl showed him all over the house, excepting the

ig cellar, which occupied the whole of the foun-
dations’ of the house, and was divided into com-
partments, one of which had originally been used

-as 9. wine bin. I _ . i  .1-.  .
, “This is a pretty old house," said Joe one ‘even
ning after he had been there a week. '

“Yes. -It was built one hundred and forty years

ago," replied Edith. . =
It’s older than I thought. Is it haunted?” *

“Gee!
“All old houses are, they say."  ~

“Did younotice the tower end—the part which
is so thickly covered with ivy?” she said.
“Sure I did. It looks older than the rest of ‘the

It is over’ two hundred years old.”
“Is that so? How does. it happen to be older
than therest of the_place?” _ _ _

twilight, owing to the fact that thejwindows
were coated with dust and covered, with a heavy,
dark dra ry. There was light enought, how-
ever, fpr im to "see that the room was ‘furnished
with‘-a small, light table; four stiff-backed chairs;
a small escritoire or lady's writing desk, evidently
of foreign workmanship, like the rest of the fur-
niture; portraits on the walls in heavy tarnished
frames; a small, deep, open ﬁreplace; a large,
heavy piece of furniture which Joe, at first
glance, took for a bookcase, but which he found
on examination was intended to hold something
other than books, and many other things.
Everything was thickly covered with half a
century’s accumulation of dust, though where so
much dustcould have come from puzzled the boy
not a little. He saw the footprints made by the
, agents, Edith and her father, but these did not
extend far and looked like footprints in a light
fall of snow. Walking to one of the windows,
he thought he’d let a little fresh air into the
musty smelling place, but the moment he touched
one of the heavycurtains so much dust was dis-
placed that he changed his mind, ‘as he did not
want to appear at the breakfast table looking
like a miller. He was about to walk over to the
windin staircase to take a look upward, when it
sudden y occurred to him that he had broken
a stringent rule laid down. by Mr. Graves, which
was that he must not leave the oﬂice untenanted
for a moment. -
“Gee! If the old man walks in there, and it's
‘his time for doing it, and he ﬁnds me out, he’l1
give me a calling down,” he thought. “I must

get back and postpone my investigations till an-.

other time.”
, He made a hurried exit from the room, locked

 '3’ the door, replaced the key and returned to the

office. He was not a moment too soon, for he
heard a door open and close and then the meas-
ured steps of his. employer sounded in the cor-
ridor. Joe ran to the window, opened the lower
sash and leaned out. At that juncture the break-

~ fast bell rang. Matthew Graves, extended to him
‘his’ customary gmetinlg, which invariably in-
cluded the query if he ‘ad slept well.

“Like a top,” replied Joe.

He was then dismissed to breakfast. Edith’s

"sharp eyes noticed that there was a thin sprin-

kling of ﬁne dust on Joe's jacket, and quite a
patch of dust on the under art of one of his
sleeves. That satisﬁed her t at the new clerk
had been in the haunted «part of the house, and
she looked at him hard, wonderinghow far his
investigations had extended. _She made no ‘re-
mark, but began to pour thegcoffee, cgcpecting
that he would bring up the matter during break-
fast. ’   l
‘1H.e didn’t, and her curiosity induced her to
question him. * -
“You have been on forbidden ground,” she said
with a half smile.’
“What do you mean?”
. "The evidence, in the shape of a sprinkling of
dust,.is on your jacket.” _
“I’m caught, am I? I didn’t intend to tell you

Joe presumed that the old man got his informa-'

out into the village. — He_ had to go anyway to
purchase supplies, which was probably the reason

weeks’ wages by this time. As he had no chance

‘to spend a cent, he felt quite wealthy with $30

a number of things, and he spoke to the old man
about it, saying that he would like to run out to
a store in the village and make his purchases.

“Jerry will get you whatever you need,” replied
Mr. Graves in a tone that satisﬁed the boy that
his employer did not wish him to leave the place.

“This is next. door to being in prison,” thought

Joe as he walked off to ﬁnd Jerry and commission’

him to make his purchases for him when he next
went out. “It’s a mighty soft job, but it has its

It was Sun ay night of the last week of

him. At ten o’clock promptly Joe entered the

not locked on him, he was not to leave the room

chuckled Joe, imitating; the old man’s tone and
manner. "I ought to e able to remember the
fact, for I have counted them often enough.” c

He walked to the open window_and .looked out.

Joe hung out of the window for a good half an

tantalising little.,bre'eze, would A ‘ﬂow across his hot
face and then die‘ out, leaving him hungry for
more. ‘At last, leavin thewindow wide open, he

walked over to the so a and threw himself on it

in a lazy ‘way. He did not feel sleepy and had no
desire to make up his bed and get into it. His
eyes rested -onfthe door of the safe which was
reilected in the light of lamp, turned ‘low,
standing on the take. ~ ’

His thought turned on the -seven -clerks "who had
held -down his job in turn not much longer than

lie had held it, and who had each been found miss-i

ing one erning, and with them had gone just one

bag of gold.

“I’m no nearer a clue ‘to the mystery than when '
‘I started in a ‘month .ago,l"he thought. “1

it’s one of ‘those tliings that never will be ound

After lying in while Joe concluded that he’d dra

not budge an inch. He tried to lift it, ‘but it .

began thinkin about Edith and what a ﬁne girl
she was. Gra ually he drifted off to sleep. Then

I say you, ave exactly described the first of the
seven cler s who disappeared from this house."

“What! You don't mean it." ~

“It is true.” ,

“How could I when I never saw him?”

“You could not have described him better had,
you known him. There were fourteen bags of
gold in the safe the night he disappeared, and
next morning when my father opened the safe in_ _
my presence there were only thirteen. One bag
had vanished as mysteriously as did John Doane
himself.” _ '

“John Doanel Was that the clerk's name?"

“It was. He was a very gentlemanly youn
man, and a good clerk. A singular feature 0
his disappearance, which was repeated with the
other clerks, was the fact that some of the bed-
clothes he used were missing, while his coat, hat
and shoes were found in the room."

“You never told me that before."

.“I thought I did.” —

“I suppose you haven't any idea that sofa is
fastened in some way to the door?”

She shook her head. i ' l I i

“I have spoken about it to my father, and
suggested that he sendfor a carpenter to detach
it; but though he thought it. strange he did not
act on my suggestion. He said that the sofa
was just in the position where he wanted it, and
that it was just as well that it was stationary."-

have lived here I should think you would have

room I would hardly give your dream a second

departure, as well as the bags of gold that got

nervous over your vision. However, it isn't rea-

‘ times “and yet have no remembrance of the fact.”

Edith looked startled again.

“If he was I am sure I should have found it

you, I am a light sleeper. I would have ‘heard him
come out of his room some time or another, and
as he has no reason to do that :1 ‘probably would.

“Well, I don't see that this discussion amounts
to anything, as it is founded. only on my dream.
That is really ‘very little evidence. While it is
true that once in a while people ‘dream things
that either have occurred, or subsequeiltl-y-do hap-

He knew it was at the end of a passage frglm
e

into the place.’ It was locked.
“I must ‘get Edith to open it and let meysee

' ' , . what it looks like.”

He. found the girl in the kitchen with the cook

article in every way, instead of that I ﬁnd ground,
for dark suspicion.” i ‘ 1 ,
“Oh, Mr. Eastwood!” ‘gasped Edith. T I
Atithat moment the cook rang the bell for sup-
per. Joe closed thestore-‘-room, locked it andhahd-i

ed thekey to Edith. They entered the dining-room‘

and sat down to the meal in silence. The faces
of both showed that their thoughts were offa
serious nature. Joe said nothing more about the
matter, for he had nothing more to say that
would throw any further light on the subject.

Whatever his suspicions might be there was no I '

use talking about them till he had more evidence-
tovwork on. How he was going to get that evi-‘¥

. dence, if it existed, was a problem; Nevertheless ’
he was deeply interested in getting at ‘the bot’-

tom of thematter. His dream, if there was any«
thing in it, suggested the solution of the mys-
terious disappearance of the seven clerks and the
seven bags of gold; but the solution was too
dreadful to contemplate without a shudder.

“In the first place, can Mr. Graves be a som-,
nambulist?” he asked himself. “It isquite pos-
sible ‘that he is. Walking in the sleep, Ihave‘
heard, affects certain sensitive and nervous per-
sons, often in conjunction with other nervous
a/ffectionshand is said to the hereditary. If M1,‘.
Graves is really a sleep-walker his daughter does
not appear "to be aware of the fact, so it strikes
me that he can’t be a real somnambulist, and
that the affliction is of very recent date. Brood-
ing=.over his money, even before he lost his ﬁr-st
bag, may havebrought it on. There is no way,
of discovering whether he walks in V‘ his sleep
except by puttinga watch on him. I must conj-

sult with Edith on the subject.”

‘Thus Joe soliloquized as he was walking alone
in the grounds after supper. He walked to the“
postern gate, opened it and passed outside. Then
he directed his steps down the creek. ‘He had

no special object in talking this walk, except rah

desire to be alone that he might ponder over the
momentous problem that had now taken full
control of him. There was an old and; disused
boathouse on the banks of the creek about half
way to the Sound. ' -

When he came to it he wentin and sat ‘onian

old box near the door.

“The somnam-bulist theory only applies to 
seven bags ‘of gold which ‘the old man may have
~- abstracted! in his sleep, but it does not account

for the disappearance of the seven clerks,”
thought Joe. “The question is does that sot‘;
operate on a mechanical principle which causes
it to revolve and dump whatver is on it into some
underground hole? If it does, why should such
a diabolical contrivance have been installed in

doubled his efforts to ‘free himself, but with no
more success than before. Thus time passed, and :.-* _

him on hand to count the seven bags of gold
before he retired for the night. . = A 

Edith had long since taken note of his absence,
from the house and she wondered where he had 1;;

She walked around‘ the grounds 
for him, and failing to ﬁnd any trace of, him, she .
hunted Jerry up and put him on the job. ‘Jerry,
told her‘ he had seen Joe going toward the postern, ‘ ‘
gate,-so they went to the gate together and round
it unbolted. That showed pretty conclusively  ,
that Joe‘ had gone out that way and had not yet’ .
returned. «- , I .

“He must have gone to some place in the vi!-' 7
lage in spite of father's objection to him doing '
so,’ thought the girl. "I can’t say that I blame .
him for wanting a change. I‘ve ‘done all I could  y
to make things interesting for him here, but, of _
course, he longed ‘for fresh company, if only for
one evening.‘ He knows father will be lookin for
him at ten o’clock, so I suppose he will be an]:
by that time." = ,1.

Edith found the -evening dull and tiresome, for
she missed Joe very much indeed.

She was feeling depressed, too, over the sug-. '
gestions that the boy's remarkable dream had 
given rise to, and this feeling was_ enhanced by 
Joe’s remarks about the contracted size of the
storemom and the inference that might be drawn
in consequence. I _‘ , «

Ten o’cliock cameat length and Joe was still _
absent. Matthew Graves presently rang the bell A , ‘
for his clerk, and Edith had to go up and tell 4., ,
him that Joe had gone out by the postern gate :,i‘;'
directly after supper‘ and had not yet returned. I ._ 

“Do you think he went to the village?,’’. asked 
Mr. Graves with a frown. , " I .
' “I have no idea where he went, father.” A

“Where else could he go? I am very much.
displeased to think he should have gone against‘ 3
my expressed wishes,” said the old man. ‘ I 

Edith said that it was possible he had gone to ’ 
the Sound instead of into the village and had >3’
taken shelter somewhere from the rain. -  »

“But the rain stopped more than an hour ago,??.
said her father. M b

“He might have lost his way in the darkness‘
replied the girl, doing her best to-make the s’
nation as easy as possible for Joe. - I I 1 -
“Nonsense! Boys are not lost so easily. /1!

g T _*‘I'm afraid something has happened to him or
 he; would be back by this time, for he knows you
L always call for him about ten o’clock.”
 _ _“Go to bed, child. I shall wait up till he re-
turns.”
V _ “.Don’t scold him, father. He will doubtless ex-
plain to you where he went and what kept him
- away so long.” —
_' Matthew Graves made no reply. He walked up
and down the room a couple of times and then sat
downat his desk. Edith ﬁnding that her father

V ‘ took no further notice of her, left the room and _

. instead of going to her chamber, returned down-
. s_,tairs'to the dining—room to await Joe’s return.
" In the meantime as the hours passed Joe fretted
 and fumed in the loft of the abandoned boat-
1 house. Downstairs the crooks continued their card

, game, smoked their pipes and refreshed them-
’ - .selves with nips from their pocket whisky ﬂasks.
.  Midnight came and then the three rascals brought
_' their game to a conclusion. Joe heard them get
up, kick the box aside and move around. A board

1 was ulled up somewhere in the floor and the boy

 

 

hear something clink like tools rattled together.’

 ' The men then walked to the door and ‘stood there
‘ {Ea while talking. Finally Joe heard one of them
,1 coming up to the loft. It was Jim, and he held
' y the candle in his hand. _
-“Well, young fellow, how do you feel?”
V ' He spoke jokingly and didn’t look for an an-
; s,wer,,for the boy, being gagged, couldn’t give‘ it
 .to.him if he had felt disposed to do so. The man
Vexamined the boy’s fetters, and ﬁnding he was
 well secured, he turned away “and went down-
. stairs. As soon as he rejoined his companions the
 -men left the building. Joe knew they had started
I for the house of Matthew Graves, and he gritted
" his teeth, knowing how impotent he was to inter-
fere with the execution of their scheme. The
‘gag bothered the boy not a little and he.ideter-
- - mined‘ to get rid-of it if he could. He rolled over
‘_ . against the wall ofthe loft and began 1‘1lbbl1'l his
' _ mouth against one of the rough posts. The olds
, of the handkerchief were gradually pushed away
-4” ‘from his lips onto his chin. ‘
.‘  lf‘1f I could only release my hands as well I’d be
 je}l1l tright,” he said. but there was little chance of
. t‘ a . T
Ten minutes passed away and then Joe heard
two persons enter the boathouse. The tones of
-' the voices showed that they were boys. What had
‘ brought them there at that time of night Joe did
»n‘ot'”sto to consider. He thought he saw a chance
to vet’ ree and so he yelled out‘: ’ A
4‘ ello, below!” ‘ T _l ,
The boys stopped their talking and seemed
startled at the hail. At any rate they made no re-
ply, so Joe shouted again: ’ , _
. ‘fW_ho’s up there, and what do you want?” ask-
ed one of the boys. » . A '
.“‘I’m a prisoner, up in the left.
out me loose,” replied Joe. - _

they suspected some trick, and then one of them
minted the stairs part way and said:

H CHAPTER XI.-—The Robbery. , _

i ‘V V Joe led the way,'keeping a sha lookout for
 -the;fthr'ee_ rascals. On reachingt e wall they
- were not in sight, so the boy concluded that they
.had got into the grounds. He walked up to the
"' gate, wondering whether he should find it open
i as he left it. He knew that it was Jerry’s duty
‘to see that it was kept bolted, except when some-
. one strolled out that way intending to return
ishortly. He tried the gate and found it un-

i fastened,,to his great satisfaction.

’ “Come in,” he said to his companions.

, Bob- and Dick followed him in, and then Joe
1 bolted the gate. They walked slowly through the
l ;- .- shrubbery till they reached the edge of the rear
~ lawn. There was a light in the window of the
goﬂice-room where Matthew Graves’ desk stood,
 and Joe guessed that the old man was sitting
‘ ivthere waiting for him to turn up. The light
would probably cause the burglars to use more
caution in theiroperations, but would not be

likely to deter. them from going on with their ‘

enterprise. Knowing that the rascals had ﬁg-

ured, on entering the ‘house through the lower

window of the tower section, Joe piloted his com-
"  panions around to that side of the building. Joe
‘soon made out that they had forced the window
 question, and were, therefore, already in the
 house.
 _ “They didn't lose ‘much time in getting, down to
 business,” he said to his new friend. “We must
- A look sharp or they-will get away before we are

T ].ready to rapple with them. The woodpile is
7  yonder. ome over and we’ll pick out a club
apiece.” » , V ,
. ‘  ‘ Tl'rere'was no difficulty in ﬁnding suitable ieces
V‘ ‘of: wood that would answer for cudgels, an .thus

"armed the boys were ready for business.

, At that moment. a girl’s scream rang out
‘-through one of the upper windows. ' '_
. _' ‘fTha_t’s Edith Graves‘ voice,” cried Joe, every

' xnefrve,in his bod tinglm at the thought of harm
‘ * coming to her t rough .t eburglars. T ' .

. ’ His plans were changed in a moment. i
T x “We must enter the house and protect her,”
he exclaimed. “Follow me.” . _ _

‘ ;He. staited for the-balcony under the window
}‘through' which the men had effected their en-
ftrancefbut hiscompanions hung back as if loath
-to take any chances against three rascals who
‘were probably armed.’ ' p . _

g “Aren’t you going to back me up?” he cried
lwhen he reached the house and saw that the
« others lagged behind. “Here, give me a boost, up
‘on’ to‘ the balcony.’,’

‘ -Bob‘ came forward and hoisted him up and he

ong.-French kind, extending to the level of the

“Come on,”-said Bob, and they started "for ‘the.’
postern gate at a rapid pace. _ V 
In the meantime Joe crossed the dust ‘strewn.
room of the tower‘ section toward the. door which

he was satisﬁed that the burglars had forced. 4 

open.

He found it half open and the lock splintered
by a jimmy. He dashed into the corridor and
made for the oflice-room, the door of which stood
wide open, and through which streamed the light ~ _
of the lamp standing on Matthew Graves’ desk.  it

Looking inside he saw the old man stretched
on the ﬂoor, bleeding from a cut on his head,
received from one of the burglars. The safe was 
open and the seven bags of gold lay in a heap ' "
on the ﬂoor. These facts only attracted a mo-_
mentary glance from Joe. A more important .
matter engrossed his attention and aroused all 
his energy. . l

The three burglars had hold of Edith-—-one b
each arm, while the third was gagging her wit 1, ,
a handkerchief as she struggled in their clutches.  
- Without considering the disadvantage of facing; «
three stalwart men single-handed he dashed for--‘ 
ward to the girl's rescue. H . -

“Leave her alone, you rascals!” he cried, smash-' ;
ing the nearest fellow in the jaw a clip that sen * " ,_
him staggering backward.  

"For a moment the ruﬂians were staggered’ by 
his sudden appearance on the scene, then they-'
recognized him with not a little surprise. ‘ 

“So you escaped, did you?” gritted Jim, duck-_

  

 
 

‘ing to avoid a blow from the boy’s..ﬁst, and their  

seizing him. . i j; ,;
Joe grabbed him around the waist and tripged, , 
him up on the ﬂoor. Springing up the ‘oy
seized one of ’the.tbags_ of gold, intending to stun

“Quick!
danger. . g _ . .

‘Bill drew a revolver and ﬁred quickly‘ at the 
brave lad. Had his aim been true Joe would “ = '
have been a candidate for an undertaker. The 
bullet, however, just skinned the boy's skull, stun-  ‘
ning him by the shock. 

He fell like one dead, however, on his face,‘thVe ,
blood ﬂowing from the furrow made by the bullet’, 
and Edith, who had got her mouth free from the 

 

handkerchief, gave another wild scream that rang

through the old mansion, and still further’
alarmed Jerry and the cook who were shivering.
with terror on the corridor above. Jim sprang
to his feet with an.imprecation., ‘ ‘ . 
“We have no time to lose,” he. said._ “Chnke
that", girl off or her cries may put us in a hole
et. ‘ '
Y He picked up the handkerchief’ and threwit
around Edith’s mouth, fastening it roughly _be"-
hind. Spying the bell cord hanging from the
ceiling, he ran -over, cut off a yard of it and tied;
the girl’s arms to her side. , , ' ' V . '
“Throw her on that sofa!”-he said to his to _[

A panions.

They obeyed. ‘ V ' ', ‘
“Now pick up a couple of bags of that gol;

much as we can carry, and we’ll get back to‘ the

Then Edith asked the cook to untie her arms.

and the cook went down to the office room. Mat-
thew Graves was revived, but he seemed to have
no idea of what had happened. The crack on the

' head he got from the burglars appeared to have

’-"aﬂ’ected his brain, for the time being at least,
and his thoughts were all muddled up. Edith led
‘him into his own room and persuaded him to go

 to bed. VWhile she was attending to her father‘

-the cook was looking after Joe, who soon came to
_his senses. . . , . i
’ The boy's first thought was about Edith, and

 Joe and Edith were at breakfast when Jerry

ess. " '

the boys came into the room. ’ 1 , .

 this house, didn’t they?” said Bob.
“Yes. How did you know?” asked Joe. _ .1:
“We were hanging around outside the rear ~
wall when they left with the money.” . . 
.“Is that so? ’ replied Joe, much interested. -“In ‘ ‘
what direction did they go?” ' . , » 
“They carried the money to the old boathouse.Y' -‘ ‘ _\
“How do you know they did?” ‘_ -' ' ‘
“We followed them there.”  I. '  ,
Bob then detailed how he and Dick had watched ’- "
the rascalsthroiigh crevices in the back of’ the
building and heard all their conversation~wahout'
stealing a sailboat and taking the money to]New 1 ‘
York, by water. He then explained how the  ,
crooksvhad put the bags of gold under the ﬂoor
and then went 01? to get the boat. . . ‘
 “And what .did you. two. do-after they had 
gone‘!"’, he .asked in some excitement. “Didn't -
you make. an effort‘ to save the money?” . V - .
“We saved it all right,” said Bob.  _
,. “You did!” cried Joe, while Edith gavepa
scream of delight. . ' ', ‘_
._ “If you'll come with us we’ll show you-where
it is and help’ you fetch it back here,” he said. i

 -Twenty minutes later the_ three boys with the 
barrow -were on the spot and the seven bags were  “
found just as Bob and Dick left them. They 
were loaded. on the barrow and the boys tool;
turns in wheeling it. Joe had just been telling
hiscompanions that that section of the house was.
said to be haunted, but that he didn’t take any
stock in theyarn. Suddenly the long French
window through which the burglars had entered
was thrown open and a ghastly looking ﬁgure 
with a skull's head, and robed in a white night,-’ ’«:'”f?

 Joe was not ca» little startled himsel’£.—Ifor.‘.the
-moment, the apparition had appeared so sudden'- .«
ly_, and right on top of» his remarks to Bob and
Dick about the reputation that wing of the house‘
enjoyed. a . A

seen come-out of that window onto the balcony
. ﬂashed across his mind-. . V . * ' ~_. » «
Grabbingup. a bag of the gold he ﬂung it at
the apparition. The bag hit the spook in the
region of the stomach and it doubled ‘up’ with .a
very human howl. 'The skull became dislodged’
from his shoulders, and toppling over fell onto
the railing of the balcony and rebounded into
Joe’s arms. Joe held it up for his frightened
companions to see, and then threw it back at the
headless ghost, which‘ was in the act of making
its escape back through the windows. - 
"Give me a lift,” cried Joe to Bob and,Dick.'-
They boosted him up on the balcony.‘ I-Ie seized
the fallen ghost and yanked it up. Between the
front opening of the nightgown protruded the
' discomﬁted face of Jerry Abbottt. . . ~,

nightgown and skull, leaving the door open" at
Joe's request. ‘T . ’ . . . “ L

v ,, , “Toss me up the other six« bags of gold-, fel-
 lows,” said the young clerk. ‘

Bob and Dick did so. He carried, the gold,

. two bags at a time‘, into the ofﬁce-room where
the old. man was seated with his daughter, who
had told him that Bob Bradley. and Dick Swift

 * had saved. his money for him. His joy over the
‘ ' return of" his money was. intense, and; the sight
. of the bags restored his recollection of the visit
"‘ of the thieves. He handed Joe $200 to divide
« between Bob and Dick, and those lads returned
home, tickled to death at their good fortune. At

ten o"clock Joe was summoned upstairs by the

old man to count the seven bags as he had been
accustomed to, and then Matthew Graves retired
for the night, and the house was soon quiet as. a

' , churchyard. ’ .

, Joe didn’t feel sleepy and he sat for some time

‘ looking out of the window. Then he be an

- walking up and down the room. He noticed t at
the hbavy chest of‘ drawers which he had shoved
into the corner of‘ the room on the night of, his
dream had been restored-to theirloriginal place.

, Evidently Matthew’ Graves didn’t like: the posi-
tion of‘ his furniture changed. Finally Joe got

a. book, and bringing the lamp to the tablebeside

. the window, started. in to read, and did not no.-
; V‘ tice the lapse of time. Although he- had heard
’ no sound, Joe suddenly felt‘ that there was some-
bod in the room. He turned around’ and was

‘a bit startled to see Matthew Graves walking
toward the safe in his slow and measured way.
Matthew Graves opened the safe, counted the

seven bags of gold carefully, then took one of
,__them out and closed the safe- as it was before.

} -' " When he started around the side of the safe with

.the bag under his arm Joe was close behind him. _

The old man walked straight to"the~ apparentl
 ' blank wall, ‘laid his hand on a certain panel, an
 .. the adjoining panel slid silently aside, leaving an
~opening.through which he passed.

. As the hanel slid back Joe shoved his foot in

. Q its way so it could not close. At thatmoment

' a loud click rang through the room. Joe turned

‘and saw the sofa revolve.
Joe, however, felt that he must have a light to
 . guide his steps, or something might happen that
' he wouldn’t like. Placing the book he held in his
' hand so that the panel could not close into place,
 he rushed over to the table and got the lamp;
‘ ..'.l‘hus provided with illumination heentered‘ the
]‘ narrow space beyond the panel, and nearly stum-
- ' . bled over a narrow and almost perpendicular
’ "flight of steps that rose before him.- On reaching
. ‘the. top of the stairs Joe found himself face to
face with a blankwall which barred his further
‘. progress.
He laid his hand on the nearest panel and
‘bent forward to look.

He heard a slight click and the panel slid back,
‘admitting him to the turret chamber. He saw
the old man kneeling down in a corner of the
chamber, evidentlylooking at something and mut-
‘tering ‘to himself. The bag of gold he had
brought with him lay on the ﬂoor beside him.
‘Joe. stepped forward and looked down over» his
shoulder. His heart, gave a great thump, for
there, in an open sandalwood box, lay the seven’
{missing bags of gold-—the, bags which had never
been stolen by the clerks, as subsequent develop-

Next morning he waited.  Matthew‘ Grav.es_
to turn» up as usual‘, but he didn't, Thebell‘ rang
for breakfast, and, shortly. after Edith came up "
to see» why he: didn’t_ come’ down.

“I’m Waltlng. for your father,” he said.

She went to her father’s, room to, see-why; he
was not up. A moment. later Joe, heard; a ‘cry ~;
of grief‘ from_ her. Herushed, to seevwhat had - 
given rise to it. ' *

“Qh, Joe,, Joe, my father is dead,” sobbed‘ Edith, xi
falling into his arms. , 

_7 The old man had died suddenly and painlessly

in the. night. Matthew Graves was dul'y— buried

and a will was found in the. safe leaving every-

thing, to his dau hter. Then. Joe, told her of the

events which ha led to the solving-of the mys-

15913’. Of. the Seven. missing bags of‘ gold, and he

took her,l_:o the turret chamber by the ordinary

Staircase in the. l_‘ower.r.oom,_ and showed her’ the

them. to‘ the. safe. and locked them up. Toe. then

told’ Edith that the sofa did actually rev,olve,.
and that mechanics ought, to be hired to. investi-

gate. the.-. mystery of it. - l

‘fThe_r.e is not doubt in my mind that the dia-
bolical contrivance was built by the old". Tory on
purpose to_make away with his. wife, and her ‘ _ -

building,” said Joe. ‘-

“Oh. 308,.” sobbed Edith, “if what you say, is
true, and the bodies of the clerks are found un_ ea‘ ~
this house, will not the stigma of murder rest on» ‘-
my poor father’s name?”

Joe was silent, foi‘ he had not considered that.
fact before. But subsequently he learned that-
none of; the former clerks were dead.- Each in
turn had quit the job in disgust when the old
man accused them of stealing, his gold. _ , V

_ Well‘,”' he said at last, perhaps the best thing.- ‘
willi-he to put the sofa out of commission for

_Joe took charge of the place under Edi'th’s
direction, for she was named the executrix of,.the

' CHAPTER XXII.
A Haunted Ship.

_ _ a It proved to b_e just_ as Phil had said, for no

L, 1.-ecord» qf.,t_he ship’s sailing, of her captain, crew

'5 - or destination could be found. , _

" The only thing they did learn was that she was

Aurora, of Boston, _and that she had been
‘bark-rigged and had a miscellaneous cargo, which

, she might have been taking to almost any port.

‘ ‘Her log and ship s pa _ers, her instruments, even
thecompass from the . innacle, all her_ boats, all
her books, everythiiig, in fact, which might either

1 have given her destination or aided them in sail-
 ing her, had been taken out and, as ‘Phil had said,
6-" they had a ship and. that was all. 4
. _~ * In the hold they found sails, ropes, blocks, spare
 /yards ‘and ever thing necessary to reﬁt the_vessel,
‘ having evident y been well provided for in that
. respect, besides. provisions enough to last two
_ - years. ‘
_ There was plenty of water in the hold, although
.1/:}_iere were a few empty casks, and bunks were
well provided with blankets and bedding, .,the
: _se,amen’s chests were nearly full of clothes, and
;.  there was a_ well-appointed tool-chest, so that
 ‘really all their needs seemed to have been looked
—’out,for, and all they had to do was to go to work,
“reﬁt the vessel with sails and rigging, and then
_ work her-‘ into port’ the best they knew. i
 “We can work her somewhere -by dead reckon-
‘ ing,” sa.id_ Captain Essex, as he_and his party sat
_; together in the cabin. We will have the moon
' andvstars, a knowledge of the wiiids_ai_id tides, and
our commonsense to guide us, and it is"strange if
we arenot able to take her somewhere. ‘.1 . ”
'. =“AnyWhere out of the land of /ice will suit me,
«sa}g1_§]lgi'ig as I don’t get seasick I am «indifferent
where we go,” remarked Waddles, so dryly that

n,ot'be the -Pole, was quite hidden from sight.”
. They had an anchor and \ ;ble, but there was no
dqabttoo great a depth of water to anchor in, and
sethey all got. to’ work to put the vessel in shape
for” sailing, ‘so’ as not to be carried in any direc-
ﬁon the winds and waves might dictate.
’ They first ﬁtted her up with one jib aid courses
nd topsails on the'_two good_ masts, and a big
wen sail on the mizzen which was broken off
1 . gy above deck, and having done this much

Captain Essex was nominally the sailing mas»

ter, and he put the Aurora on a northerly course, ' -’
knowing whether this would take him to Aus- ’

not
tralia, South America, Africa or India, there be-

ing no south at the Pole, and but one starting‘ v ‘ 7

place for all parts of the world. ~

The company would have to be divided into 7
watches, but here a diﬁiiulty arose, for no one. ,
wished Wills to be in command or to serve under ’

him, and ﬁnally it was settled that Phil should"

be first oﬂicer, with the two men and Johnson as

his crew, while Captain Essex had Dick, the pro» ’

fessor, and Wills for his crew,

herself cook._ ,
Wills said nothing, but went around with black

looks which told Phil that he must be on his guard,

Sadie appointing V A

as it was evident that the man bore him a grudge;

and meant to pay it. ‘

‘He made no treacherous move, however, and i

therefore they let him scowl all he wished, it be-
ing well understood that at the moment he showed

a disposition to act on the oﬁensive, he was to be.

seized and put in irons.
Despite ti-.-

man’s known attempts on Phil’s .‘

life, and his efforts to do mischief to Essex and.

the rest, they could not be so inhuman as_ to leave

him behind in that desolate land, and so they took ‘A '

him along, but only upon the settled understand~
ing that as soon as they reached a habitation he

was to be put ashore and left to shift for him-
, .

self. ’

It was on the second night of theiixvoyage they '

knew not where, Phil being on deck, the vessel on
the starboard tack, with the sea on the starboard
how, when a strange sound was heard, which
caused the ,.men to start in fear. -

"Bless my heart, what’s that?” cried Johnson. It

“Is there any one hurt?” I
“What’s the matter, Johnson?” asked Phil. ~.
“Thought I heard a groan, sir.”

At that moment the sound, which was certainlyr ‘

like a groan, was repeated, and in a few moments

Wills came on deck from the forecastle and said:
“If you fellows on deck are sick, there’s no need

for you to groan like that and keep everybody .

awake.”

“The groan, or whatever it was, came from be?

low,” said Phil. “Go below, Wills.”

“The ship’s haunted, that's what’s the trouble,’’’’ A A

growled the man, “and there won’t be ‘no luck   "W

her as long as——-—” '
“Go below, I say,”

tious fears of the rest.

‘Wills obeyed, but the fearful sound was re? 

peated with full force as he disappeared. ‘

a said Phil, sternly, fearing-i—
that the man’s words would excite the supersti-, 

 

It was at once a groan and a shriek, and even  W.
Phil could scarcely listen unmoved when he heard; ‘

it, brave as he was.

‘All the watch it came at intervals, sometimesf”
longer, sometimes shorter, never when it was ex-_'*
pected, and always caused a shiver to go through _
the men, although Phil told, them that the sound

had some natural cause, and that they mustlook
or it. » . " '
“I’ve heard of ships being haunted,” said ‘Per-l
kins, one of Wills’ companions, “and I’ll wager
that this is one of "em, and that’s why she was
leftby the men»... ' ou don’t know. Mebbe the M
was; murder done. and it’s.the‘-dead man at

. "The sound was repeated even as he spoke, and
«i he retreated, pale and trembling.

" ‘When, Captain Essex took the deck the sound

, was ‘not heard nor’ again for several nights,‘ but

the sto had got abroad that the ship was haunt-

 ; ed and t e men were most uneasy. _ ‘

"It happened during the middle watch one night

ten days later, when Captain Essex was on deck,

the sea breaking on the starboard bow, that the

‘ ’ strange sound was heard again, this time louder
than before. *

. " j“I say the ship's haunted!” growled Wills, “or

 else there’s a man in the hold and he’s trying to

get out.", .

Captain‘ Essex came down from the quarter-
déek and said: i ' ‘ " '_ ’
. ".‘fO en the hatch. _It’s hardly possible that a
man as been there all this time, but I’m going
tofinvestigate this thing. There is no such thing
as‘ a haunted ship. Either someone is trying to
huinbug us, or there is some other natural cause

:H'_— for this sound.”

The aﬁter—hatch was removed, and at that mo-’..

’ ’ment thevessel rolled to leeward, when the sound
'  all had heard was repeated with startling dis-
, ‘ tinctness and louder than ever before. - _
f «.,'W,ills fell back from the open hatch with a
 scream, clapped his hands to his ears and
' 'sh‘rieke‘d: ‘
“That’s Fenton: I know his voice; that’s the
scream he uttered when I threw him from the
, bridge. Take him away; don’t let me hear it, or
' I shall go, mad! Now it’s the engineer; I killed
, li‘im,.I made him drop the wrench, it was I who
;,' tried to tempt him from his duty, it was I
i‘ bwho-'——‘-”‘and then, asthe sound was repeated, the
V man fell in a ﬁt on the‘deck.

CHAPTER XXIII.
The Ghost Found.

 

‘:For days Wills was in a raving delirium and
talked of many things that gave not only a true
insight into his character, but revealed things
‘i ‘W Wlililch he supposed were known to none but him-
' ‘ se . E ,' ,

g.’ He described the deaths of the engineer and

_ice pilot, told how he had sought to kill Phil,
.and how he had meant to destroy the ﬂ°3tmE
‘home of the Castaways. _ ” « _

“Could the man’s greed for gold make him 0 to‘
such lengths?” muttered the boy, aghast. re- —
member that Johnson said he would do anything
for money, but I can scarcely believe this. ’ ‘

“Oh, I’ll kill the boy quickly enough,” said
Wills, tossing in his bunk. “I hate him; he has
stolen the girl; he is liked and I am hated ;_ he
stands well with Harry Essex, and I am here 3
only on sufferance; he is handsome, and I am not,;'j. :.
he has money, and I have not, and’I hate 'hiIh"7’“ 3.:

hate him, hate him!” and the man fairly ,‘gro'u’nd’T
‘his teeth in his rage, - _' _, j_j__: - " ’
“Oh, yes, I'll killhim for you, John, Freeman,‘ _

Then he went off into ineoherentniiutterin s,’ -
and they were obligedto strap, him to his_.be_.‘to, '
prevent his getting upand going on deck- .  ;..

In a day or, so he becaine.quieter,%»and atwthe 
end of a week his delirium‘ seemed toihave; left’?
him, and he soon grew rational again, although ' 7
moody and silent, seldom sa 'ngf anything--and

No one spoke to him of what he had said dur-
ing his delirium, and he seemed unaware thathe 7
had revealed anything although the continued’; ~
moody and taci'tu‘rn.’= ’ ‘ '- ~ ‘ '  j, " . _~

The strange sounds in the hold had not been 
heard for some time, but one night, when they
were far beyond the land of ice, and the weather“
was quite warm, the hatches being left open"to'
admit of a free passage of airvthrough theslii ‘, 
which was on the starboard tack, the waves da '- ~ 2
ing against her starboard bow, there suddenly . '
sounded above all .other noises a dreadful groan
and then a shriek. - ,» , _

Wills, who was on deck at the time,.echoed the ’ ‘
shriek and then, springing to the rail, criedin» '- -
frightened‘ tones: ‘ » ’  j ‘

“There he is, there he is again. I know that 
voice, it’s Fenton. He haunts me, I shall never
escape him, he haunts me!” I, _, 

The sound was repeated louder and more te1'ri- '7 T‘
fying than before, and with a shriek that ran
in their ears for many a day, the man leapet‘
upon the rail and dove headlong into the sea. a

The vessel must have passed over him, for 
did not reappear. ’ . ' 

Without boats they would h'ave been unable tow
pick him up, even if they had seen him, but the
keenestsearch from all points failed to show any
signs ofhim, and it was more than likely thatlhe
had been drowned soon after striking the’water.

UNPUBLISIAIEVDAMS. IS EXEMPT FROM A
. SEIZURE IN FRANCE

27 ;

An.'author’s' unpublished manuscript may. not be"-

seized under anv conditions,_a Paris court has
held. The court based its decision f‘on the fact.
that a manuscript must be regarded as a produc-
tion Which the author holds secret, andis inviol~

able like his thought or conscience until the mo-'

ment he publishes it.”

The ruling arose from the attempt of 8. young L
Japanese poetess, Kidou Yamata, to seize a man-_ ,
uscript on the life of the fourteenth century

poetess, Komachi, completed by the Belgian writ-
er. Jean Nolesve. ’ ~

Miss Yamata and M. Nolesve had begun world,

on the manuscript in Tokio some years ago. 

Nolesve was transferred to the Belgian Diplo-

matic Sérvice in Rome, and the collaboration;
ceased. The Belgian, however, completed the work

and sent it to a Paris publisher.

Then Miss Yamata attempted to seize.it, 

lost her case and had to pay her erstwhile col‘-4
laborator 1' franc as damages. , L

‘.‘Indeed! Tell me about it.”

' call the opium smoking-den of the festive ‘washee-

I ‘became seated, and the detective went ahead:
,“‘You may not remember that about two years
ago the attention of the police and the public in
~ eneral was called to the fact that an unusually
 farge number of cases of ‘unknown persons found
.. drowned’ were reported.
, ’ ‘- “The suspicions of the authorities were aroused,
 and our agency took the matter in hand.
“In a city like Chicago or New York, it is
. diﬁicult to trace even a single man who mys-
cteriously disappears, and while in more than one
of.thes'e cases of ‘found drowned’ the victim was
 fully identiﬁed, in‘ no one of these cases could it
flie» positively decided whether there had been
»‘ foul play or suicide ‘at the bottom of the matter.
1 ~- — “As fate decided it in each case«where identi-
E .'ﬁcation- was accomplished, there was no evidence
. of foul play upon the remains of the deceased.
I ‘. “I reﬂect a good deal upon the case, and it oc-
curred to me that if, as I suspected, the persons
I found had met with foul play before they _were

he would make a critical post-mortem examina-
'ti'on,vsuch as the authorities had not yet made,
é‘a's" it required great skill and considerable ex-

I That very day as I was on my way to dinner,

whose appearance at once rivetted my attention ‘

for the opium case was in my mind. . ’

“She was selling ﬂowers, and as she presente ’
her basket, ,and.ir_iy eyes dwelt upon her face,»I, 
was certain that in her I beheld a victim of the . .
deadly drug. ~ . ’  f

“I purchased a button-hole bouquet, and when‘ 7 1
she turned_away I watched her. Indeed, I fol- ’ -
lowed_her in the stealthy way of a shadow, and
She did not evade my secret espionage until I I »
saw her enter a Chinese laundry on Clark 1’ '

“I at once made up my mind that before the.

of _an opium den, and I heard it whispered in,., .-,
police circles that_the _very Chinese laundry in ‘_ 
Wl’l1Ch_ the ﬂower-gir_l disappeared was suspected ’
of being an ‘opium Joint.’ .r

“When I reached my office I found a young

‘the habit while suffering from neuralgia. The
opium was prescribed by a physician.’

hideous old Chinaman who was, as I soon found
‘out, Sang‘ Loo himself, and who _ma be justly
,. ‘called ‘the Chinese opium ﬁend,’ an two other

C “Therewas no evidence of the ‘fatal pipe’

 “said ‘I wanted to “hit the pipe,” ’ as the China-
men say, I was conducted to an interior room.

of the hideous Chinamen ‘fed the pipe,’ as he
9 called keeping the opium in it on ﬁre, the others

“Just before I entered the den I had taken
 an enormous dose of a preparation —furnished
by my medical friend, which ‘he .said wouldecoun-

PETRIFIED F"ORE'S'1‘,A MYTH’ '

Dreams of a petriﬁed forest near Burns’,-»0re.,»— ' '-
have literally gone up in smoke since two studentsw
of the University of. Oregon, John W. Bean‘ and
Harry E. Wheeler, seniors in the Department 
of Geology, have returned from the‘ region,  "
declaring they have -proof that the‘ trees andbther 
similar formations are nothing more than rhyo-
lite, a rock that has been ejected by volcanoes.’ “ ' 

This rhyolite has in some places taken a form.  :
resembling the grain of wood, and‘ where it has 
been exposed to weather has become pitted some-._
what like the bark of a tree, thus leading to the“
belief that the region was a siliciﬁed forest. “ '_  -

The students also declare that socalled bones? '
reported as having been found in this form'ati'on" "
are volcanic “bombs.” :

“Associated with and of the same com'position_-f
and origin as the rhyolite are several conspicuous-
deposits of volcanic cinders and ash,” statesa re‘—'
