CHAPTER I.

'A DOUBLE h(URDER.

» ‘fHa\'e you read the morning papers, Nick?"

Chick asked the question as he bounded into .\'ick

Carter's private room in New York early one morn-
ing? in September. i

 

J 9"YeS," replied Nick, looking up from the work of

peeking a small valise; "what do‘. you make of it?"
Faiiiiliar as Chick was with the odd ways of his

I ~ chief. he stopped and Stars! athim with a blank look

, ” 90 his face. -
  ~i~wim do I make of what?" he asked.

' E "‘bi the case you came here to talk about.” was the
V sober reply. i . .
 :‘g(;hick threw’ hirnseli into a chair andwlit a cigar.
’;j"7f’Peeh;aps," he said, “you can tell me the name of
 I‘ came  to tail: about?"

 

 

 

Nick never looked up from his work’ of packing.

"Of course I can,” he replied.

“You're a'mind reader if you can." said Chick}
"for the papers are full of inurllcrs, burglaries. and
embezzlement cases this morning," ’

"But," replied .\'ick, "there is only one case in the
whole lot calculated to put a detective on his mettle."

“Well?" ‘

“And you. being a good detective," continued
Nick. “came here to talk about that one case."

"When you get done with your ﬂattery." said
Chick, with a pleased look on his face, "perhaps
you‘ll have the kindness to give a name to that one
case.” ﬂ

“Certainly. ’
Ohio."

“,(Iorra.-.et. Queer ease, isn't it ?”

“How do you know‘ that ?" demanded the sheriff,

Nick pointed to some drippings of tallow on the
ﬂoor of the kitchen, and then hastened out to the
barn. V l

He returned in a few moments with a large tin pa'i1
and a crushed candle in his hand.

“The murderers were waiting for them when they
got home," he said, addressing the sheriff, “and as
soon as they were in bed, they knocked on the
kitchen door.”

“How do you know they were not in the house?"
asked the sheriff.

“Because Weldon got out of bed, probably very
softly so as not to awake his wife, who wasasleep,

“Then a bullet was fired from an iinusually large‘

’“Because,”' replie'd Nick, "the bullet went through
the body, through the carpet and the ﬂoor, and
landed in the cellar.” ‘

The detective handed .a ﬂattened piece of lead to
the sheriff as he spoke. i

“There,” he said, “is the bullet which ﬁnished the

work begun in the kitchen.” _

“It is str:snge,’T replied the sheriff, “that none of
my ofﬁcers found it.”

“After killing the woman," continued the dctect- =

ive, “the murderer went to the pantry in search of a
lantern. He searched the place, but did not ﬁnd one,
for the very good reason that it had been left in the

barn by the tanner.”

He at once began covering the windows with the
blankets, taking great pains to leave no opening by
which a ray of light might escape.

“would have made too much noise.”

“I wondered what you were hunting around after

‘screws for,” said his assistant.

“We can’t be too careful,” replied Nick, surveying
the sealed windows‘ with satisfaction, and‘ then pass~
ing on to the sleeping—room.

When the windows there were sealed, he lit his
'dark lantern and began a close inspection of every
article in the two rooms.

He crawled under the bed, drew the tacks from the
carpet, and even pried up a loose board, which
looked as if it might have been recently removed.

“ﬁre murderer spent a (couple of hours in the
house,” he said, “and did not find what (he wanted, so
it is quite evident we. shall have a long hunt for the
private papers of the dead man.”

the victim, wes a small, slight man, with a fair com-

hands“ and feet, ‘the former very white and sliapely."
