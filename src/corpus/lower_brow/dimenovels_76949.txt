The roar of the train had no more than died aw;1_v_.
and he was about to stir from the telegraph pole,
when his attention was attracted by approaching
footsteps.

The detective grasped his revolver, and looked
down the trixcks.

At first-he could see nothing moving, but the

‘ sound of steps walking on the sleepers came nearer,

and at last he saw a man approaching.

he was a track-walker. ,

The detective stood still until the track-walker

Then,.in a low voice, he said:

“If I was running away,” he thought, “I might do
something here.” «
He stepped from the tracks and went up to the

_ house.

The bridge ended at a door about ﬁfteen feet from
the ground.

There was another and broader door at the
ground level. - .

It was closed, but when the detective took hold
of the handle it opened at once.

“Ah!” said he, softly, and stepped inside.

He did not take out his pocket lantern, but he
felt of the lock with his ﬁngers.

This examination satisﬁed him that the door had
been broken open.

CHAPTER V.

A ONE-SIDED BATTLE.

Nick closed the door behind him.

Then he made a quick investigation of the house.

He had no doubt that the door had been broken
open by ‘the man he was pursuing.

That could have been done for only one purpose:
to steal a boat. '

By this time the boat must have been stolen and
the criminal was probably somewhere on the river.

If he had been hiding in the boathouse when the
detective entered, he would have ﬁred his riﬂe.

Nick found that the boathouse was built on piles.
and that half its length was over. the water.

That half was without a flbor except for» a narrow

‘ platform that ran=*alon‘g the sides.

At the river end was a wide door, and that also
hadbeertbroken open; ‘ '
.  number of boats were stored in the house, some
on the ﬂoor,so’me hangingfrom the walls.
Among them was a light canoe. '

“I shall have to turn thief for a while,” said Nick

the water. ’~

He; found oars‘ and paddles in a corner, and from’
them selected a paddle, with which he got into the
canoe. . ' ‘ " t

Then he pushed open the water door and glided
out upon the river. T 

His positioniin 'pnddltng’ ‘enabled h_lm»<to'loo‘k’
, ahead-A.‘ ii.  -' “ ‘  

     

  

  

_ 14 .

The river was very broad there; and there were
high hills upon the further side. .

A little below him on that side were the street
lights of a town. ‘

“The VVest Shore Railroad,” thought the detect-
ive, “runs through that town. I haven't got a time-
table, but it’s safe to say that there will be an early
train for New York this morning. I should think
my man would try to connect with that train.”

While he was thinking and paddling, his eyes were
searching the dark level of the river.

There was nothing to be seen except the town
lights, and, far down the river, a few other lights,
that evidently came from a tow of canalboats.

Nick paddled rapidly, for; sure that his man was
on the river, he hoped to overtake him.

i - He kept the canoe pointed toward the town, but
, Z i he could not keep a perfectly straight course, for
ii‘ the current bore him steadily southward.

 f ipfior this reason the appearance of the lights
 ,;c.hanged slowly, and when he was about in the mid-
 oi the river an electricarc light,‘ set on a pole

NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

Clouds had broken away, and left the moon shin-
ing full upon the river.

The detective saw his man, and saw that he had
gained on him.

But the moonlight was as useful to the man in the
rowboat as it was to Nick.

A good deal more ‘so, in fact, as was proved imme~

. diately.

The man stopped rowing.

“Onto me,” thought Nick.

The detective paddled harder than before.

Now he steered straight for the man he’ was pm-—
suing.

The man in the boat stood up. V’

He was too far away for Nick to see just what he i
was doing, but he knew an instant later. 4

There was a flash from the boat. ‘fj

Alittlel later came the sharp report of a rifle, and 1‘
at the same instant a thud and a little splash of water
at the side of the canoe. ‘ g

“N o longer any doubt that that's Lacrosse,” rnut 
tered Nick. M ; ~
“There are few crooks who are such good marks. j

N men as he is.”

 

. The riﬂe bullet had struck just in front of where ‘
Nick ‘was kneeling.
It tore a hole in the canoe an inch below th
water line. A 1‘ i 
Nick pressed his left thumb againstthe hole and 
continued to paddle with his right hand; 
i“Give‘me two minutes,” thought the detective,
‘fand I’ll be in revolver range. From here I couldn’t 
send a bullet half-way to him.” 
Lacrosse ﬁred again. ’ M: 7.
He was undoubtedly trying to hit the detecnydétia

  

     
   

good one. ' p
The bullet struck the canoe behind Nick, 
again ‘there was 5 splash of water to show that at?
hole -had been made below the water line. 
r “Well,” thought Nick,yturning' to investig~atgglIE" it

W “Rn; beaten at this game,” thought thedetective,

j, ‘ yfhalf-rose from his seat, swung the paddle in

air, and then fell full length. V

As he did so, he stopped the leaks as well as he
could, and a moment later cautiously raised his

‘ M ‘d above the ‘gunwale.

‘Lacrosse had sat down and was rowing again.
But he had changed his course.

Then he climbed the hill to the owner's house.

Nick explained to him just what had happenecl..

and offered to pay for the canoe.

“Not a cent!” exclaimed the owner. "I am only
sorry that you didn't capture the Scoundrel."

“I sha'n‘t rest until I do,” responded Nick.

“VVell, if he brings you this way again, you take
my boats without asking any questions. And,
meantime, come in and let me get you some dry
clothes."

Nick gladly accepted ‘this invitation, and stayed at
the house until he had had breakfast.

After that, he was tlriven to the nearest railroad
station, where he took a train for New York, arriv-
ing there before noon.

CHAPTER VI.
KNOCKED OUT.

He found a telegram from Chick that told him
nothing new of importance.

Chick had become satisﬁed that Sheriff Dunn’s
story was correct, that the body of the man in the
barrel was that of Farmer Malcolm, and that the
murderer was no longer in the vicinity of Niagara
Falls. . 4

By this time, of course, Nick was sure of all that,
and he set himself at once to the task of locating La-
crosse in New York. '

_His first step, after making a careful disguise, was
to go to the VV est Shore Railroad station and make
inquiries. ' » _

.As it_ was quite possible that Lacrosse had
changed his plans after the battle in the lioats, and
comeito the city by the Central -Road, Nick" also
made an investigation at the Grand Centralstation.

He made no headway at either place.

If Lacrosse had arrived in the city, he had come in '
‘such a way as not to attract anybody’s attention.

There was nothing for the detective to do, there-
fore, but make a round of the dives where crooks
were likely to ‘be found.

Nick’s: long experience and perfect knowledge. of .

New York City enabledihim to do this as no other
detective could have done it. ’ ’ ‘

He” knew‘ that certain kind: of crooks o'n"ar_rivin‘g.

   in ~
',Now Lacrosse was a Canadian. On the west side
of town were a number of placeskept by Canadians,
' and Nick decided to begin his investigation there.
But there was no sense in beginning at midday.
Lacrosse had been awake all night.
That was certain, and it was probable that after

 

 reaelrling the city he would put some hours into-

sleep.
-4 ‘Besides, it wouldn’t be like a clever crook to show
himself by daylight.

n evenin  4 .
. 7‘Bef e going out he lookedrover the late editions
of the papers, and found one item that interested
him; i A '
it was a dispatch from Haverstraw, a town on the

  

 

‘ cotneyraghore there in the morning.

- i (“The boat had no name,” said the paper, “but the
‘.initials /‘J. E. D.’ were painted on the stern. In the

So he treated the swindlers who tackled him, and
went onifrom one place to another, until, about ten
o’clock, he entered a basement dive ‘where there _
were a good many tough characters idling about.

Two men near the door were talking in ‘Canadian
French. A
The bartender, as Nick knew, had lived in Que-
bec. ‘ ‘ V

“This will be a good place to stay in for a while.”
he thought, and he, dropped into a chair at a table. a

Nobody was sitting there at the time, but not

many minutes had passed before three men took the

other chairs.

Nick seemed to be dozing.

“Well, deacon,” said one of the men, slapping
Nick on the shoulder, “what do you think of New
York?” _

“IA-lay ?" asked Nick, pretending to wake up.

“What do you think of New York?"

“You: calledrne deacon, didn’t ye?”

“Of course”, A l

“Wal, say,” and Nick looked uneasy, “who give it

Goshtamighty! I wouldn’t want the folks to hum to

know I come in here.” .

with him to the end of the line, at One Hundred and
Fifty—ﬁfth street.

The L road connects there with the Northern
Railroad, on which there are all-night trains to cer—
tain suburbs.

The crook went to the ticket ofiice, and asked
some questions, from which Nick judged that he
was not a regular traveler on the line.

"If he was," reasoned the detective, “he wouldn’t
have to ask questions about the running of trains.”

There was a half—hour to wait before the next
train on’tl1e Northern, during all of which time the
crock sat in the waiting-room, with the detective less
than ten feet away.

Nick could not make up his mind whether the fel-
low suspected that he was being shadowed.

It didn’t matter much. The crook was one of La.-
crosse’s gang, and, sooner or later, he would Show
the way to his leader. i

All Nick cared about, therefore, was to keep the
man in sight, which was easy enough until the train
started.

Nick had bought a ticket to the end of the line,
and he satin the car behind the smoker, the crock
being in the latter car.

The detective saw him prepare to getout at
‘ Cortlandt Park, which is only a few miles from:the

isﬂe had not penetrated his disguise, but Nick knew ‘

A it included’ -much.

Instead he caught up the man who was nearest to
him, held him ﬁrmly, and pushed his way rapidly to-
ward the window.

“Tackle him!” yelled Lacrosse.

As he spoke he withdrew his hand from the closet,
bringing out his revolver.

One fellow laid for Nick.

The detective let go of the man he was carrying
long enough to swipe the second a terriﬁc blow that
sent him sprawling to the floor.

Then he picked up the ﬁrst before he could break
away, and in one stride more was at the window.

There he whirled about and held the man in front
of him. .

Lacrosse was about to ﬁre, but he held off because
the bullet would have had to go through the body
of his comrade before it reached the detective.

For the shortest possible instant there was 2
pause.

The other crooks were standing out of the way to

give Lacrosse a chance to ﬁre.

Nick lifted the man he had seized and hurled him
across the room toward Lacrosse.

The instant he let go he turned to the window,
threw it up and let himself out.

The crooks gasped with astonishment.

It seemed impossible that the detective would try
to escape by dropping from a ﬁfth story window!

Even Lacrosse was startled into holding back his.

For Nick delayed not at all.
7' Loweringhimself quickly, until his weight hung
by his ﬁngers on the window ledge, he let go.
Down he went, live stories to_ the stone-paved
court below. i
But Nick did not take thatxiall in one drop.

There was a balcony to the floor below,--the re-

mains of a_ﬁre-escape.
The building was old, and this was the only part

of the ﬁre—escape left. The rest of it had tumbled

to pieces. Nick landed on it, nearly going through
the 014, wooden planking: A clothesline ran out
from this to a pole in the middle of the yard, behind
the house. It was newyran on a pulley and slantéd

l\7'ck saw Lacrosse leap from the car, run for the
train and catch it.

Then the rascal stood on the rear platform and
waved his hand triumphantly at the defeated detect-
ive.

Perhaps Lacrosse thought he was safe.

He might have been, if it had been anybody else
who was pursuing him.

Nick Carter’s blood was up. p

“I’ll have him!" he said to himself, through gritted
teeth, and he hurried to the yardmaster of the rail-
road. ‘

There followed a quick conversation which need
not be repeated here.

The detective explained who he was, satisﬁed the
railroad man and told him what he wanted.

The result was that within five minutes after the
train had started, Nick was in pursuit on a special
engine.

At the first sta;ion beyond Morrisania, the engine
slowed down, and Nick shouted a question to the
station agent, who was standing on the platform.

“Did anybody leave the train here?” he asked.

“No,” replied ‘the agent; “two men got
aboard-—”

Nick did not care to hear more.

He turned to the engineer and nodded.

Full speed was got up at once, and before the next

- station was reached, they had the train in sight.

They could see that nobody left the train there.

“Shall I signal the train to wait for us ?”. asked the
engi.neer- — . , . - - .

"N o,” replied Nick; “wait till we come to the next
station.” . .

,The enginewas close behind the train.’ at the next
stop. )- V g .
Nick saw Lacrosse leave the train and start up a
road leading inland. -

Accordingly, he told the engineﬁf 50 5“-TP. and 8
moment later he was running up the same. road,

The fugitive was in -sight, but he was A good "run-

-ner, and kept his lead for nearly-two miles

And Nick was right, .~
Licrosse did go down that road, but not afoot.
Nick got through the forest in time to see La-

There was a single-track trolley line on that road.
It ended at a point near the rising ground that La-

At that moment a car had come to the end of the
hue, and the trolley had been reversed for the trip
back. to the nearest village.

Nick swung aboard the rear platform. _ T
He sat on the step a moment to catch his breath,

But the judge was behind the beer bar. He was try-
ing a case of wine.

They took me over to the beer bar and when I laughed
the judge shouted, “Order 3”

So we all did.

And after we all had a drinkthey took me over to the
law bar. The judge says, “What is the charge against
this man ?" meaning me.

The bartender says, “Seven-sixty, including the
cigars.”

I refused to settle without a pick. So the oﬂicer gave
me one.

I says, “Judge, I’m a good fellow. I have money and
I'll prove it if you will take evidence.”

The judge said he would take evidence, so I told the .'
bartender to pour some out. And the bartender poured
out three ﬁngers of the best evidence in the place.
Then the judge called for the bottle. He put the bottle
on the stand and he continued taking evidence until the
evidence was all in. - .

And when the evidence was all in I says, “Now.
judge, what do you think you can hold on the evidence?"

The judge said he did not think he could hold an -
thing on the evidence. He says, “I'm in luck if I ho cl
the evidence." ’

And two minutes later he went out on the sidewalk ,
and reversed his decision. Just then a friend of his came
along and says, “Hello, judge. what's up?"

The judge says, “Everything but the cork, I guess!"

STRIKING-LOOKING STAMPS.

. One of the most striking sets of stamps issued recently
is that for the Malay settlements of Perak, Pahang,

Negri Sembilan, and Selangor. There are diﬁerent sets ‘

for each of the above places, similar except for change of
name. ‘They are printed in two colors, the low values,
I, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 50c. being all of the same design,
, with head of a very savage-looking tiger with mouth
open in center. The $1 and $5 are larger and oblong,
and have a group of elephants in center.
Salvador has been one of the most proliﬁc stamp
. issuing countries of recent years. It issued a new set of
stamps, ‘of ten or twelve values, every year, and in
1895 and I895 issued two full set of regular stamps, be-
sides postage due, postal pack, oﬂicially sealed, and sur-
charged provisional stamps, not to mention a full line
of envelo . postal cards and wrappers. The lastissue,

NICK CARTER WEEKLY. 31

Amateur Detective Work.

V Boys, in reading one of the Nick Carter stories did
 you ever try to think ahead and guess who was the
criminal in the case?

In the case of “Nick Carter‘s Ocean Chase,” for in-
stance. How far hazl you read before you suspected that
%i'Palog was the man who had stolen the missing crown
diamond?

In that case Nick suspected him from the day when
 .13; visited him with the oﬂicial of Roumelia to tell him
 about the loss of the great diamond.

[“ Or take the story of Nick Carter and the Guilty
, Governor. Had any of you any suspicious of the Gover-
 nor before he admitted that he was the head of the
Nihilistsiiin the province of Perm?

‘ orig: the story of the mine under the Grand Duke’s
palace, did any of you suspect the woman who had con~
eeived the plot of blowing up the palace?

 Each of the readers has a chance to ﬁnd out how

 
    

He has the facts of the case laid before him just 3
Nick Carter himself has.

Of course, he has not got I\‘ick’s experience or won-
derful detective instinct. Still, he can prove whether
or not he is a good detective by trying to decide in his
own mind what the solution of the mystery is before he
has read to the end of the story. The earlier in the story
he is able to make his guess and the more accurate it is,
the better detective he is.

We want to see what sort of detectives the readers of
the Nxcx CARTER VVEEKLY are. _

We want one and all of you to write to us, telling ‘us
whether you ‘were able to solve the mystery that Nick
Carter had to solve before reading to the end of any of
the stories.

Tell us how far you read before you arrived at your
decision, and just what points guided you in making
your decision. Your letters will be printed in this
column. _

Get to work, now, boys, and show what kind of
detectives you are. ’
