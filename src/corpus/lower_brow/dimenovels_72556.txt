"You mtle vulainz" cried Broker Blaokford, seizing Jay by the throat with such a vicious grip
that his eyes bulged and his tongue protruded. "You've ruined me by throwing
that bunch of stock on the market and breaking the price.“

 ‘AFTER THE GOLDEN EAGLES

.‘.‘I saw them through the window,” replied Jay.

“You did!” she exclaimed in surprise.. “What:

brought you to the station at this hour, and‘on
such a night, too?” _ _ _ . -

“I came down on the midnighttrain from Jer-
se _ City, which you’ve been looking for. It was
he d up by a washout at the culvert.and had to go
back to Edenvale. I came on by myself, as I
didn’t mind a mile walk, seeing that the rain had
stepped. When I saw by the light that you were
still on duty, instead of turning off by the path I

‘came on here to have a word or two with you be-.

fore going home. As_ things have turned out it
was lucky for you I did so.”

“It was, indeed, and I am very, very grateful
to you for rescuing me from a terrible situation,
and for savingthe company’s money in the safe,”
she said, ﬂashing an earnest look into the boys

face. _ _ ,
\ “That's all right, Miss Rose. I couldn t do any
less than I did under the circumstances. Now
ou’d better call your uncle down, so that he can
eep a watch on these two rascals while I notify
the head constable to come over here and take
charge of them.” _ _

Accordingly the girl ran upstairs, aroused her
uncle and told him what had happened. Peter
Wynch, who was a smallhwizened’.-looking man of
sixty-five years, was put into a kind of blue funk
by the news. He was not as valiant even as his
niece. He hustled on his clothes and came down
to the office in a state of some trepidation. The
looks of the rascals didn’t reassure him a bit.
The chap Jay knocked out had recovered his
senses, and was threatening all kinds of dire
vengeance on the plucky lad. Notwithstanding
that both were bound Mr. Wynch seemed to be
afraid of them. Jay handed him both of the cap-
tured revolvers.

“Now just mount guard over ‘these fellows, Mr.

I Wynch-, while I go and notify the-constableu He

Mr. Wynch seemed to have his doubts about
what help he could expect from Rose in an emer-

—». igency. At _that moment a call came over the wire
, for the girl and she went to her instrument to

answer it. Jay waited till she was through, the

I .. message having something to do with the blockade

. on the line, and then, after wishing «her good-

 

 night, for he didn’t intend to come back. he

started off up the road. Constable Pettingill

' lived about a quarter of a mile further in the vi]-

  

lage than Jay, whose mother’s cottage was on
what-,, might be termed the suburbs. A smart walk

‘ ' of ten minutes brought him to the oﬁicer’s house,
-and Jay pounded lustily on his front door.

The
noise awoke the constable, who opened his bed-
room window and demanded to know what the
trouble was. Jay told him in‘ a few words, about
the affair at the station, and said he had better
get there as soon as possible with one of his as-
sistants and take charge of the rascals. Mr. Pet-

, tin 'll promised to do so, and then Jay went home.

e had to be called next morning "in order to

 a hurried breakfast and catch the eight

~ the ﬁnancial district.

had been repaired during the early morning hours,
by a force of men, and trains were running just‘
as if nothing had happened. He reached the.
oﬂice at the usual time, and was the first on hand,_
as usual. ‘ A number of letters and papers lay,"

inside the door where the - letter-carrier had,

pushed them through the brass-covered slit made‘,
for that purpose. He -put them on his employer's,
desk, retaining a copy of the Wall Street “Argus”,
to look over himself, for he made it a point to:
keep abreast of everything that was going on in
Jay was ambitious to be-
come a broker some day himself, and wasn't let-
ting any chance get by him to pick up all the in-
fourntiiation about the operations in the market he;
co .

He frequently bought and sold shares dealt in-.
on the Curb for his boss, Roger Wicks, who had;
a good deal of conﬁdence in his business Sagacity.
By giving his attention strictlyto business he
knew almost as much about the methods of the-
oﬂice as did Mr. Griggs, the head bookkeeper and-
cashier.
the transactions of the New York Stock’ Ex-V
change, and knew how every important stock-
stood at the close of the day’s business. Indeed,
he was something of a speculator himself in a
small way, andwas generally fortunate in all the
deals he undertook. Starting with a small legacy;
of $500 he got from his grandmother two years
before, he had now accumulated the handsome.
little capital of $5,000, which he kept on tap in-
a Wall Street safe deposit vault. . ,

His mother and sisters knew nothing about the
successful use he had put the $500 to, as he was-
very reticent on the subject of his personal..af-.
fairs. Some day, he told himself, he would spring
a surprise on them, and the bigger the surprise
the better pleased he would be over it, The head
bookkeeper and himself were the only employees
in the office, for Mr. Wicks was not a particu-
lrirly prosperous broker. The trouble was the
Curb broker was that he was a dyed-in-the-wool.
speculator himself, and he often got his bum st
in the market, which kept his nose, ﬁnancial y
speaking, more or less down on the grindstone.

'Jay, who was familiar with his plan of opera-"

tions, was of the opinion that he took too many
chances, but, of course, it wasn't his place to tell
himhso. dTEe boydhad bﬁen ‘akout ﬁfteenhminiﬁes

Griggs camé in. That was the signal for him to
ﬁake thehplapeg into his employer’s room and get

on easy terms the first thing he did was to tell’
tlég bookkeﬁper about his experiences of the pre-”
.c ing nig t. _. , .
“You had quite a strenuous time, didn’t you?”
smiled Mr. Griggs, as he opened one of the books.

.-he took from the safe. _ , -
“It seemed pretty strenuous for the moment the, :

rascal held his revolver a ainst my chest. I don't’,
know whether he intende to shoot me if he could
avoid it, .,but the senation wasn’t pleasant. Miss’
Brierly, who is a plucky girl, and has more sand,
than her uncle, covered the fellow with a revolver

she took from a drawer, and that let me out of,

my hole.” . » _ _ ..

The stenographer, whom Mr. Wicks employed,
by contract, came in .and.,,sat down to wait for

paper. ‘In a short time Mr. Wicks made his ap-

pearance, and entered his private room. Five
minutes later he called Jay in andhanding him a
note said: -

“Take this over to Clarkson, Jay. I expect an
answer to it.”

The boy put on his hat and went out. Clark-
son was a Curb broker whose office was in the
Taylor Building, across the street. It took Jay
about ﬁve minutes to get there.

"Mr. Clarkson is very busy. Take a seat,” said
the office boy.

Jay did so and picked up a paper to amuse
himse!‘ with. A moment later two Stock Ex-
change brokers came in and asked to see Mr.
Clarkson. They were told they’d have to wait till
he was disengaged. They sauntered over to a
window not far from where Jay sat reading.

“I learned this morning that the Titus crowd‘

are buying up every share of B. & L. they can get
hold of,” said one. “That can only mean they are
trying to corner the stock for a boom. It’s low
just now, so they’re bound to make a raft of
money. I’m going to buy 5,000 shares if I can get
them, and I advise you to try and get in on this
thing, too, for it will be a winner.”

_ -“You canrely on the sources of your informa-
tion, I suppose?” said the other.

' “Yes. The person stands close to the Titus
bunch, and is in a position to pick up a plum once
in a while.”

Their conversation easily reached Jay’s ears,
and he couldn’t help hearing all they said on the
subject during the next ﬁve_ minutes, at the end
of which interval the gentleman who had been
with "Clarkson went away and the oﬂice boy told
Cooke he could go into the private oﬂice. So Jay
took his note in to the broker, and presently left

. the office with an answer, and a tip as well, which

he determined to make, use of.

CHAPTER III.—An Unpleasant Surprise.

After Jay got back to the office he looked B. &
L. up on the morning's market report and found
that it was ruling at 65. Recent past records of

' the stock showed that it usually sold from 70 to

75. That proved it was below its normal value.
Accordingly when the boy went to his lunch he

t $3,000 of his capital from his safe deposit
ﬁix, took it around to a banking and brokerage

house on Nassau Street which had put through-

his other deals, and ordered the margin clerk to
buy him 300 shares of B. & L. at the market, on
a 10 per cent. margin. ‘ On his way to the ferry

that afternoon he dropped in at the bank, about-
’ﬁve minutes before the ,
closed and asked if the stock had been" bought. '.

brokerage department

He was told that it had been secured at 65. and
was being held subject to his order. As the stock
had gone up a point toward the close of business

"in the Exchange he left the bank well pleased

with the prospects of his latest deal.
» “If that tip pans out as I hope it will I ought

to make a good haul this time,” he said to him- '

self. -

after ﬁve, and_ went into the station to see Rose. 
She was upstairs getting supper for her uncle and
herself before going on _duty at_six. Mr. Wynch
was very gracious to him, having learned from
the girl how he had saved her and the company's ;

-money on the previous night by his unexpected 

appearance on the scene, pluckily attacking the '
twp men with only the axe_ handle _for a weapon.’ " 
You_11 ﬁ_nd Rose upstairs,” said the station ;  .
ageflty Jerking his thumb in the direction of the ‘ , 4:, «
staircase. ~ . —-   ‘
Jay had never been in the living-rooms of the 
agent, and he felt a littlebackward about in- ~ 
ti-uding on the _girl_ there. Mr. Wynch, however, " .:_ ;
told him that his niece would be_glad'to see him,’ ' ‘ .
9-Pd Was expecting’ him to drop in, as he usually  1'. :
did, from the 5:15 train. due at Plankville at 
5:55, when Rose was generally in the oﬁice. No ,
doubt shemade it a point to be downstairs when‘
that particular train came in, knowing that the
good-looking Wall Street boy would give her a,
call. ‘So Jay marched upstairs and knocked on. -

“You will always ﬁnd me such, Rose. I liked

There was no doubt that Jay meant what he
said and Rose believed him.

to prepare the evening meal as usual.

On Monday morning, B. & L., the stock in
which Jay was interested to the extent of 300
shares, opened a half a point higher than it closed
on Saturday and in a short time jumped to 77.
Montana Copper, in which J ay’s boss was inter-
ested, opened a full point higher and was soon
ruling at 33. -

During the afternoon B. & L. was ruling at 80
and Montana Copper at 3'7.

On Tuesday B. & L. reached 88, and Jay hustled
ii to the little bank on Nassau street and ordered
his holdings in the stock. sold. He realized $7,000
by the transaction. Montana Copper rose to 40.

It was a good thing that Jay sold his B. & L.
that morning for during the afternoon somebody
dumped a big block of the stock on the market
and the price dropped. It kept dropping and was
presently down to its former price before the ad-
vance. .

Mountain Copper was likewise falling in price.

Jay was now worth $20,000.

On the following Saturday afternoon Jay set
out for Plankville and found that his ﬁreworks
had arrived before him, and had been locked in
the baggage room along with .a lot of other ﬁre-
works belonging to various residents.

There was a window in the baggage room and
as Jay turned a corner of the station suddenly he

saw two men, one of them going through the win-”

dow which had been forced open. Jay knew they
did not belong there and shouted at them. One of
the men turned‘ around and Jay recognized him as
one of the crooks who had ﬁgured in the at-
tempted looting of the station safe.
knew the boy at once and made a_ spring at him,
striking at him with a cane which he carried.
Jay dodged the blow and started to alarm the
station agent. The man sprang after him, and
just then Murphy, the village expressman, came
driving up with his team.

The villain who had gone through the window

now appeared and called:

v“Come on, it’s done,” and started to run.
The other villain turned away from Jay and
followed. Suddenly fromvthe baggage room there

the iron box, which he proposed, no doubt, to bury

tion indicated the small freight shed and half a
dozen empty box~cars. \

As Jay’s eyes roved around the landscape his
attention was attracted to a light down in the
hollow of a‘ near—by— ﬁeld. It appeared and dis-"
appeared constantly, as if some object passed
frequently between it and the‘station. Finally
the light was raised, apparently by some one, and
lowered out of” sight. It remained hidden only
about half a minute, and was returned to its
former place. Jay’s curiosity wasaroused.

“I’ll bet a dollar that Mr. Wynch is over there
digging a hole to put the iron box in,” he said
to himself. “I take it as a sign that he’s got the
box out of the ruins. I’m going oyer to inves-
tigate.” Accordingly Jav made his way to the
field in question. Climbing over the fence he
located the exact position of the light. It was
near the foot of a big oak tree that grew up out
of the hollow. ‘

He walked toward it and soon made out the
ﬁgure of a man at work in a hole. The light
came from a lantern standingon the ground, and
its rays dimly illuminated the face and figure of

-eter Wynch. He was hard at work enlarging
the excavation he was making among the roots
of the tree. Of course’, he could have only one
object in laboring so hard at that late hour.

He had found the iron box of golden eagles
and was going to bury it there. Jay managed
to get quite close without betraying his presence,

and he watched the station agent’s movements.

with a quiet chuckle. At length the hole was
ﬁnished to Mr. Wynch’s satisfaction. Then Ja_,y
saw him walk a few feet away, bend down and

~ drag something to the hole.

The light ﬂashed ,upon the iron box with the
heavy round knobs. Mr. Wynch lifted it with
difﬁculty and dropped it into the hole, after put-
ting a piece of board down first for it to rest
on. He laid a small piece of board on top of it
and then began to ﬁll. up the hole. When it was
level withythe surface Jay saw him cover it with
several squares of grass turf, so that it would

I resemble the rest of the ground around it.

"“He’s foxy, all right,” chuckled the boy, as the

station agent proceeded to cast the superﬂuous

’ stairs.

 
 

dirt as far away as he could. When Mr. Wynch
had removed, as well as he could, all signs of
his late work, he picked up his lantern and walk-
ed back to the station. As soon as he had left

i’ the field Jay Walked up to the tree and took the

exact bearings of the spot where the box lay.

‘ With his jack‘-knife he cut a cross in the bark of

the tree and then left: the ﬁeld himself. .
“He won’t disturb that box until the station

building shall have been rebuilt, so I have plenty

of time in which to get possession of it for Rose,”

I thought the boy as he passed by the burned end

of: the station and took the road for home. Next
morning, which was the Fourth of July, and con-

under the sweeping branches of the wide-spread-"v V '~
ing oak tree. Taking out the shovel he walked-to ,
the roots of the tree and began to dig in front of‘ " ’
the cross he had cut in the bark. The only sounds
that broke the stillness were the croak of. the :
frogs in the creek near by, and the chirping of the »
crickets and other nocturnal insects. Jay had »-
little fear of being disturbed at his work, for _he'
didn’t believe there was a soul abroad in the jv'i- ‘
cinity at that hour. He was mistaken, however.
Two rough-looking men were walking"along the .
track from the direction of Edenvale, with bags » 
over their shoulders. when Jay came down the ..
road with_ his cart, and they saw him. . _ .-
Not wishing to be seen, and presuming he was '
bound across-the track intopthe road beyond, they ,’
hid behind the corner of the fence near the shed , .
used for the temporary station. When they saw ‘ '4’
the boy stop, take down the fence and -push his *
cart into, the ﬁeld their curiosity was aroused. , -— 
“What do you s’pose he’s up to, Jim, at this '
time of the night?!’ said one of them. . ' , 
“How should I know?” growled the one ad-‘. 
dressed as Jim. '. .,. ~, v— 
“Looks kind of queer, doesn’t.it'.’" said the ﬁriti I 
speaker.  ‘ 
"K.i1ider,” replied the other. . _ ‘ "
“Let’s follow him and see what his game is.”,
“I’m with you, pal.” ,  
-They left their bags under the shadow of  2 -
fence, crossed the roadand entered the ‘ﬁeld at ’-g'__
the moment Jay ‘stopped under the tree. ~’ ‘ . ., 
“He's got a shovel,” said Jim. “Goi_n’ to dig‘ _,_

 Alt length he went back to the cellar again and
spent another hour there. ‘Finally, as the sun
was now low in the horizon, he was obliged to
abandon the quest for the day. He left the cart
= where it was and returned home. Supper‘was
’ . waiting for him. After the meal he "took Rose
to the station, and on the way he told her the re-
sultsof his afternoon search for the box.

“I'm satisﬁed I’ve located it,” he told her. “It
is somewhere around the old mill. I believe it's in
"the cellar, and I’m going to make a further hunt

. g for it—in fact, I’ll pull everything to pieces there
,, but I'll find it.”
, Rose was much encouraged by his hopeful out-
. look, and believed that her property would ulti-
‘ mately be found.

» ‘ “Under the circumstances I think there is every
prospect now of you getting your golden eagles,”
said J ay with an encouraging smile. '
' Next morning Jay was undecided whether to
-' remain in Plankville that day and make another
- hunt at-the mill, but ﬁnally decided -not to, as he
- wanted to be at his oﬁice when his furniture and
_ ﬁttings arrived. He had to appear at the exami-
nation of the two rascals, however, before he left.
‘ ~ Rose also appeared against them on behalf of the
' railroad company. They pleaded not guilty of all
the charges brought against them, but the evi-
V ‘ dence was sufficient to cause them to be held for
3: trial. -Both detectives took them in charge and
' carried them to Jersey City, where they were
locked up and the case put in the hands of the
district attorney. Jay went’ on the same train,
' and at the ferry landing took the boat for New
York. He found on arriving at the Sullivan
" Building that a part of his things had come and
: had been placed in'his oﬁice. Before he went to
 lunch a man came to install the ticker, and later
—' on the safe was hoisted up and placed where Jay
, wanted it. In fact, before he left for home every-
.. thing was ready for business, and he felt that at
 "last, he was a full-ﬂedged broker.

ters took a turn the other way. Accordingly he
went around to the little bank where he had made
the deal and told the margin clerk to sell his
2,000 shares.
when Jay got his statement and check next day

he found he had made $22,000, and had just dou-‘

bled his working capital. J. & S. Went a little
higher and then gradually declined without creat-

ing any excitement. The short-lived boom of J. &/‘

S. was hardly forgotten by the brokers when*an-
other one started in W. & V. shares. Jay heard
a bunch of brokers talking about it ‘on Saturday
morning.

At present W.—& V. was ruling at '79. - Jay went
into the gallery again and he saw that a prom-

inent broker was taking in the stock whenever

it was offered. That satisﬁed him that there was
something doing in it, so he bought 5,000 shares
_ When he reached
Plankville he was stopped on the platform by Mr.
Wynch, who looked to be in extremely bad humor.‘

Look here, Cooke,” the_ old man said, “do you
know anything about_that iron box which you saw
in my room at the time of the ﬁre, and which I
afterward dug out of the ruins and buried for
safe-keeping in yonder ﬁeld?”

‘_‘I ‘know that it belongs to your niece, Miss
Brierly.” ‘ v .

“That’s_ false. It oeiongs to me. Did she tell
you that _it belonged to her?”

::She did, and I _believe her.”

I tell you she IS. mistaken about it. The box
and contents are mine.” .

“Well,_wh_at about it?” '

“I buried it under the big oak tree in the hollow
of the field. I have discovered that it has been
dug up by_ somebody who learned in some way
that I buried it there. Did you dig it up?” '

‘fWhy do you ask me that question?”

_“Because I_suspect you to be in league with -my
niece to deprive me of that box.” _

“If it happens to be her property I don't see

where your kick comes in.”
“I tell you it is not her
station agent angrily. -

.“She claims it, and.has a letter to prove that.

her grandmother left it to her.”'
“That isn’t the box referred to in that letter."
“Isn’t it? Then where is the box mentioned in
the letter?”
“I don’t know anything about it.” ,
"I Should think you’d made it your business to

keep track of a box containing a lot of golden -

eagles for your niece’s"sake.” . . _
_t3:‘,I:Ier grandmother left all her money to char-
] . ‘

f‘I Suppose that can 310 proved. I shall advise
Miss Brierly to put the matter in the hands of a
good lawyer.”

At these words Mr. 'W'yn<:h looked greatly ‘dis-’

turbed.

“You mustn’t put iaolish
head,” he said. ,

“I don’t think that is ID. foolish idea. However,
I sha’n’t say anything about the matter till she
gets hold of the iron box which you buried and
which I feel sure belongs to her.” V

connected with the box and its appearance as far
as he was acquainted with them.

:“How did you know I buried it under that.

tree?” demanded the agent. _

“I suspected that is what you meant to do with
it as soon as you got it out of the ruins, so I
watched- you at night and saw you hide it under
the oak,” replied Jay. -

Mr, Wynch seemed to have some doubts about
the truthfulness of the boy's statement concern-
ing the part the crooks had in the matter. _

He believed that Jay was trying to hoodwink
him, and he threatened to apply for a search-
warrant to go through his mother's cottage.

“You can go ahead and get out your warrant.
I’ll guarantee you won't ﬁnd the box, because it
isn't in my house," " . _

“Then I’ll have you up before the Justiceand
compel you to tell where it is.”

“I couldn’t tell what I don’t know; but I warn
you if you do have me summoned Miss Brierly
shall go before the justice, too, tell her story and
produce her grandmother’s letter. I guess that
will call for explanations on your part that might
embarrass you.” ’

Mr, Wynch didn’t relish the turn the conversa-
tion ilvas taking and walked away. '

As next day was Sunday Jay planned to take
Rose with him to the old mill and make another
hunt for the box of golden eagles. When he got
up in the’ morning the weather looked so threat-
ening that he put the trip off to the afternoon.

' It commenced to rain about noon and rained

steadily till dark, and that prevented them from
undertaking the trip. During the greater part
of the following week J ay’s attention was taken
upiwith W. & V., which was the cause of consid-
erable excitement at the Exchange. On Thursday
the stock boomed to 95, and at that ﬁgure_J_ay
sold, cleaning up a proﬁt of $64,000, and raising
his capital to over $100,000. «

When Jay reached Plankville that afternoon he
found a load of cheap furniture and other house-

- hold effects at the station and the men moving

the stuff upstairs into Mr. Wynch’s new quar-A

ters. « ,
» The furniture belonging to Rose’s room, which
had esca ed the ﬁre, an which_Mr. Wynch had
been ma ing use of while his niece was staying
at the Cooke cottage, had been returned to her
new room, and everything would be ready that
night for her to resume her duties next day as
her uncle’s housekeeper. It happened that the
following Sunday, was also rainy and disagree-
able, so Jay postponed his trip to the old mill

. once more. \

CHAPTER .XV.-—H0w Jay Got Hold of the-
>‘ Golden Eagles at Last. ‘

In some way the news had got’ around. that Jay

- Cooke, the boyish~looking tenant of Room 119 in
' the Sullivan Building, had a wad’ of money at

his back. Those who heard the report could not
say how true it was, but several brokers were in-
terested enough& to try and investigate the story
and size up the new broker. Among the traders
who, on one retense or another, made it their

, business to ca l on Jay during the following week

, - FAME AND FORTUNE .W"EEKLY

Sile Hill, and a crowd of villagers arrived at the

cottage. - _ _ “ , _ , ,
. “So, so,” said Hill, gruffly. There s been killin
. goin’ on here, eh?” He glanced at Young Jack-

son" as he spoke.

.-“As you see,” answered Young Jackson, who
‘was watching him as closely as a sat watches a
“ Mimouse. 

.» “Anything missin’, gals?” the constable asked,

turning to the bereaved and drawing his right
' hand across his eyes. _ _ _

. The girls explained that their father’s light-
.‘ colored pocket-book, containing a large sum of
‘ money, was gone. _ _

Young Jackson noticed that Hill’s left_ hand
was imperfect; The middle ﬁnger was missing,
from the second joint up. . .

LI-Iill strode across the room and proceeded to
 examine the dead man, and as he turned away
,‘ after doing this, he, seemingly accidentally,
, knocked Young J ackson’s coat from the chair on
V T which it lay. _

’ , As the garment fell to the floor, a large light-
'colored, leather pocket-book fell from its inside
-pocket. . ‘ ‘ _

 “My father’s pocket-book!” exclaimed Mabel
’ ‘Heath, springing forward and picking it up‘.

- ' Young Jackson was dumbfounded.

' ‘d “How in the deuce could ‘that have got into my
pocket?” thought Young Jackson; but, notwith-
standing the alarming situation in which he found
himself, he was as cool as an icicle, and as com-
posed as a judge.

Mabel did so and all saw that upon its light-
colored surface was the imprint of a human hand
made in blood as the hand had grasped it, and
they all noticed that in this accusing stain the
middle ﬁnger was wanting, from the second joint

up.

' Hill began to tremble like a leaf.

“Now, then, gentlemen, just one 'more_point,

came into this cottage I found him standing over
the dead body of Mr. Heath, and I -noticed that he
had something in his -mouth. Open your mouth,
Dragon, and let us see what you have found.” The
dog opened his mouth and a button fell upon the
ﬂoor. Young Jackson held it up, and all saw it

was the missing button from Hill’s coat.

“It’s a clear case, and I arrest you instead of’
you arresting me!” said Young Jackson, produc-

ing a pair of handcuifs.

“Who are you?” demanded Hill.
“Young J ackson, and this is my dog

was the answer, as the speaker placed his hand

upon the headof his canine assistant."

Hill was handcuffed and led away to the vil-

lage jail, and although there was some talk of
lynching, Young Jackson walked by his prisoner’s
side with his pistol in his hand, and therewas no

attempt made to do so.

Hill was in due course of time tried, convicted

and executed. Before his death he returned the

money he had stolen.

Young Jackson bcame a

frequent visitor at the cottage on the cliff, and if

he does not. one day make Miss Mabel his wife, it, 7 ‘

. SALT-AND—SAND WASHING

Y. Damp sand mixed with salt is used to wash
dlshesin an English hotel. Stains from grease,
tea and other foods are quickly removed by rub-
bing the dishes in this preparation, says Popular
Mechanics. Also loss from breakage is reduced.
About 25 per cent. of the mixture is salt. The
utensils are given a ﬁnal cleaning with water.

BUTTERFLIES DARKENING

Black butterﬂies will-,_ﬁll England if the pres-
ent industrial era keeps up its smokiness, accord-
ing to a recent report made by English scien-
tists. One explanation given for the steady
change in the color of the butterﬂies is that they
have been eating much lead and manganese salts
deposited from factory smoke ‘on the leaves of
their plant foods.

VALUABLE SEAWEED

The seaweed collected along the Breton coast
of France brings in the tidy sum of 30,000,000
francs yearly, which at pre-war values meant
$5,000,000 a year. The ﬁrst factory for the man-
ufacture of iodine, its most valuable product
(though seaweed is also an important source of
potassium and sodium), was established long
ago. It takes a ton of fresh seaweed, approxi-
mately, to make a pound of iodine.

OPEN AIR IS BEST

 The open air is better than any auditorium ever
devised, as far as clearness of hearing is con-
cerned, according to a recent report of University
of California physicists. The walls ‘of a room
may increase the general loudness of speech
sounds, but this is more than counetracted by the
confusing reverberations the walls introduce. A
room that is carefully padded with hair-felt, or
that is built with a porous, spongy wallplaster,
will approach, though not equal, open air condi-
tions:
