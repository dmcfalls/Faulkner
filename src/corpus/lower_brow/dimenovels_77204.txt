 the station-house, after his arrest, he had had a talk
with the three men whom Nick, Chick and ‘Patsy had
arrested earlier in the evening; that their names were
Fred"Smithers, Al Baker and Tim Sullivan; that they;
were [all members of the “Black Cat” gang; and that they

,li'adia,d1nitte(l to him that they hadendeavored to abduct,
Grace Amory, and would have done so but for the in-.

piterference of Nick Carter and his aides; that they hath
'_been hired‘ to do so, having been promised a considerable

vsnrn on their successful performance; that, while they
would ngotg:mei1tionlnames, Colton was satisﬁed that they, __N
\ plied Chick. .

. had been instructed by Coulter, who was acting for some
 rtperson inthe dark. ’ ~ ‘ «

All'ofktliis was mostimportant to’ Nick, as it bore out i

what had been his instantaneous belief on arresting the
men.

After what had developed subsequent to that arrest, in T

the call upon Mr. Amory and his (laughter, and the
, chase after the man who had escaped by a trolley car
’ . on Columbus avenue, suspicion naturally -went to Mack-
« stain as the manin the dark. '

   

.C,hick expressed this suspicion in words.
" __“Yes,” replied Nick, “suspicion naturally jumps to
 —that man. The trouble is that there does not seem to

be "motive enough in his mere rejection by Miss Amory,-

f{._'e§o_u.p1ed with his standing in social and business circles,
L ' to’ justify: the belief that he would resort to such lawless
T frfnaeasures. Thegtwo things don’t seem to‘, gee.”

boss of the gang.”
_I.-arr_v now got up and going to another table, where
a group was sitting, spoke to a man who rose and fol-
lowetl him to the table where Coulter was sitting.

- if consenting to whatever it was that Coulter said. ‘
' “Do you know that ,man’s name,” asked Patsy.
T “Not. his last name,” said Halloran, “but he is called
“Three-Fingered Jack, because he has "lost two ﬁngers
 on his left hand. He’s a thief, and they say they were

-shot off by a policeman who was chasing him.”

Shortlye after this Three-Fingered Jack; left the saloon

“Do you know his name?” ‘ I '-
“I was told before I let him in to ask if his name was

Nick dashed "out of the room, and, going to the door,
threw it open. . I . - ’
“Is Mr. Macklyn in?” asked a voice.
“What name, please?” ,
“I have an appointment with Mr. Macklyn."
“Is the name Coulter ?” ,
, “It is, but Macklyn’s a fool for giving it.”'
“Mr. Macklyn will see you in his room," said Nick. in
his character as the man servant. ' . A .
He led the way upstairs and ushered Coulter into the’
front room on the second ﬂoor. ‘ -

THE saconn ATTEMPT. v - 

On Coul'ter’s entrance, after greeting him-,.Macklyni
said to his supposed servant: « ‘
“Go out. Close the door after you, and go _down-
stairs.” '
Nick went out and closed the door after him, but he
did not go downstairs. ' » ‘ 3 A
On the contrary he slipped into the back room from .-
\the hall, and from thence, into a narrow passageway 3
which led from the back room to the front room. Reach-~
ing the door which opened into that front" room, he deftly. 
and skillfully opened it far enough to be able tosee that
the two men, as ‘a beginning of their business,‘were’iak— . I

Boldly Nick swung open the door and stepped in. ,»He
closed the door after him noiselessly. « _ 2»
JNear the door and, across the corner, was a large, 
high—backed, old-fashioned sofa. ~ _‘ . . .i
Over this Nick climbed as light as a catydropping-_»' 7
down behind it, thus completely conoeaiing himself.‘ ‘ 
‘‘I don’t know whether this is wise,” -he said to himself,
“for I may not be able to-get out if I’m called. , But I’ll
, know what goes. on in this room”.  " r
Macklyn took up the business at once. ' .  ’ , -‘ .
“Have, you got your men, Coulter ?” he asked. ~ .. ..
“Yes,” replied Coulter, “they are waiting at -the prqper
places for the instructions.” . « ~ 2 ,  ,
“There is no time to be lost,” replied Maclglyn. _‘.‘I’ll

' JAnother "ball that followed immediately went wide of
the mark, and Arizona Jake, with a smothered oath,

A wthrowing ‘himself fairly across the backs of the two ‘

horses, turned himself over on his left side so as to give
his right ami free motion.

the driver full in the shoulder, and he toppled from his

 “Whoop!” yelled Arizona Jake. “I ‘ﬁxed the galoot A

' Patsy’s submissiveness ended when he was‘ drawn out
of the coach. . , . .

_  To the intense surprise of the rri-an who had drawn
; ., ” him out and who supposed hewas handling a weak fe-
male. this weak female delivered a blow straight in his
 T eye that nearly put him out of business on the first go.
_ y A’ VVitliout waiting to see wThat the effect of his blow had
i  9 been. Patsy danced up to the next one and let him have —
‘ T one in the stomach that nearly" doubled‘ him up with

 "cramps. _ . if _ T ,

 than he had attacked at the other coach had hardly re-
covered from his surprise over the viciousness ofit,
when Nick dashed by him, opened -the coach door and

:’_5n7s,prangT in, seizing the man within before he “could get

‘  out on the other side. , '

:_ ' The man, whether Macklyn, as Nick supposed, or not,

' 7 made a stiff resistance, and gave Nick a stiff ﬁght.

 yNick instantly appreciated that he had no weak and

if 1', ‘dissipated club man to deal with, but a trained athlete.

 The contest inside the coach was a vicious one, in

M V which hewho was ﬁghting Nick was trying with bulldog,

-.  fferocity to do Nick personal injury. T
T In the beginning of these contests the driverofithe
 standing coach took in the situation. i .

 T Tlie men attacked so vigorously by Nick, Chick and

on, but Arizona Jake, leveling his gun at him, called on

 ‘him to stand fast. - i,

M , ” . The man, however, did not standT fast, but letting his

\ f several feet, carrying Nick and his antagonist within, the

He held his horses ﬁrm. . , . y A y . .
_ In the meantime, the contest within the coach had i
been progressing with doubtful chances until Nick, per-
ceiving that if he were to win he must put forward his
best efforts, drew his revolver and grasping it by the
barrel, threw himself with all his for‘i:e upon the man.
with whom he was ﬁghting. M . , i

Gasping him by the throat, indifferent to the blows“
the man was raining on his head and face,"-he brought
down the butt of his revolver on the top of his head.’ .

The blow renclered the man nearly, though not quite,_
unconscious, but it also had the effect of throvwing him
heavily against the door of the coach, which ‘ﬂew open—_——
»s'on1ething both were unprepared for———and t-hey. both.

Nick was the first to gain his feet, but hardly was he 7 ».T :
on t_hem, when the man, ‘apparently regaining full 1305- __
session of himself,'sprang up and faced the famous de—' I T
tective in an effort to continue the ﬁght. r . , . ‘

“H55 game enough,” thought Nick to himself; “to be
a straight-man.” s M ’ ‘

Now, out upon the sidewalk, in a space not so con»
ﬁned as the coach had been, this man displayed unusual V
knowledge of the artfof boxing. _< ’

Had he been facing any one but so, supreme a master
of that art aswas the famous detective, he rnight hav
been successful, indeed, he would have been,iin',i
