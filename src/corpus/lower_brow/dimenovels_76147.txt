‘ "You’re in great luck,” said Joe, enviously.

“You put me in mind ofvthe story in the Arabian

Nights of the ﬁsherman who found a valuable

r3n9,' in a ﬁsh, and made his fortune out of it.”
“I’m not likely to make my fortune out of this.

It’s come to me in such a remarkable way that

 I wouldn’t sell it for a mint,” said Dick, regard-

ing the ring with great satisfaction. “See, it ﬁts
my ﬁnger as if made for it.”
“Finding that ring would be a ﬁrst-rate item
for the newspapers.” ' ’
“And most people who read it would consider
it a newspaper yarn.” A
‘“I’ll bet they would. Such a thing is not likely

I ,to happen twice in a thousand years.”

*“Oh, I don’t know. Fish have a tendency to
swallow anything‘ that comes their way, provided
it’s small enough to go down their giillet.”

‘ “I suppose you believe that the whale swal-
lowed,Jonah?” grinned Joe. ’

“Certainly. I understand that some whales’
throats are large enough to swallow a fair~sized

\child or even a man. "That story is one of the ,
truest in the Bible.”

“Somebody must have lost that ring,” said Joe.

'. “Probably one of the summer boarders in this

\ neighborhood. Better keep the ring out of sight

until you leave here or somebody might claim it.”
‘-‘If they did, and could prove .property, I’d
return it, of course; but I’d hate to lose it under

' the circumstances.”

“I wouldn’t take any chances, though it’s hard-

~ly likely anybody at our boa\'ding-house lost it.”

The sky had darkened up considerably since the
boys caught the two ﬁsh, and the cloud Joe had
called attention to had spread out to the very

' zenith. There was evidently a storm coming up

from the southeast, which was the direction in
which the village lay. The shore itself curved out
intolthe Sound for several miles on either side of
it, ending in a pair of rocky headlands that
formed the mouth of the bay.

The yacht lay anchored midway between them,
and somewhat out in the Sound. The boys
thought it was an odd anchorage, when the craft

CHAPTER II.—-The Lady of the Yacht.

A stout hawser held the sloop—_vacht to'“h
moorings, and against this the wreck of the‘\sa1’,l,
boat was -ﬂung. v.The shock shook Dick into th
water, and the next thing he knew he "was cling‘:-
m'* to the taut cable, while Joe and the Wreck

. were home out into the Sound. To add to their
\ peril an unusual darkness had settled over‘-Vthe“
‘face. of nature, occasioned by';uthe,den’se-[blank

clouds that now covered the s from horizon to
zenith on all sides. ~ ,
Dick clung to the-hawser in a .pretty despera; ,
frame Of mind.,for it looked as it‘. hisgspan of
life was a very‘ narrow one. After much trouble ;
he drew himself up out of the reach of the waves-
and for a while hung on to the oscillatin cable,
“I won’t last much longer here,” he t ough
“I must try and reach the yacht or perish.” ' '2",

’ Solhe began to climb upward till he got within
a yard of the hawse—hole through which the cable
shot out into the boiling water. To go any nearer
was to invite destruction when the vessel pitched ,

not pleasant, or invited conﬁdence. , _

“How now, Ethel,” he said, -with awpecul

‘Is that wonderful, when Heaven seems to for-’

“Pierre, this young man has sought shelter

“Oui, monsieur,” replied Pierre, who occupied
the position of steward on ‘board the yacht, favor-
ing Dick with a searching and peculiar look.

Then he disappeared as quietly. as he had
appeared. ‘

“T__his way, Duncan,” said the gentleman,
courteously. '

presently. Avail yourself of them while your

Thus speaking Mr. Conway left the room, and
Dick began to slowly disrobe. He could not help
thinking about the poor mad woman. Apparently
her mind was aﬂlicted with the strangest kind of

a inania—-that of associating her husbandand his I
’ friends with deeds df rascality. ‘

“It must be pretty hard on Mr. Conway,”
thought the boy. “I don’t wonder that heﬁnds

She's a ﬁne looking woman—-statelyvand.hand-

afforded.

7at-. the‘ top of the mast, in the form of a large
«triangle. There were lights to be seen dimly along
- the Connecticut shore,- and also the green and red
“lamps of an’ approaching steamer. Dick looked
: over the side to try and see whether it was too
“Ltough for a boat to take him ashore. Although
he had not seen a sign of the crew, he supposed
hey were forWard._
, v‘:‘,I-Iow about putting me ashore, Mr. Conway? I
,don’t ask to be carried clear to the village. . If
 .ou w-ill have me landed inside the eastern head-
« and I can find my way to the village all right,”
" said Dick. i
A’; -“Not to-night, Duncan- It’s too rough, and too
dark. You shall occupy the stateroom in which
oiilchanged your clothes, and in the morning
my men will row you to the village,” said the
yacht owner.
f€You are very kind, sir.” -
,-$‘Not, at all. You are quite welcome to my
hospitality,” replied Mr. Conway in a genial tone.
"They paced the deck‘ for a while and when they
.-went below the table had been cleared away.
»‘fSeat yourself and ma-ke yourself at home. I
have a little business to transact and will return
* ofrtly. Yonder are several of the current maga-
zines.‘ Help yourself.” _
;'_I‘hus speaking Mr. Conway left the cabin by
‘y of the forward passage. Dick got one of
hegmagazines and was glancing over it when the
«door of a room nearly opposite was cautiously
penedr and the head of the demented lady .ap-
peared. Dick did not notice her at the moment.
After‘ listening intently. the lady glided out of
her room and made straight for the boy, who
’ ooked up and saw her. She put her ﬁnger to her
ijps, stopped midway and listened again. Then
the hastily coverted the rest of the space, forced
paper into Dick’_s hand, and retired to her

_“‘Be on your guard—-drink and you are lost--

 ‘;That was all. The writing was clear and.dis'-
inct, theiwork of an educated hand, and hardly
Ipoked like the product ‘of a diseased mind. .
“That’s a strange woman,” thought Dick. “If I

yself with her ravings? »She’s out or her head;
and to pay, any attention to her warning is sim-
ply absurd.” _ _ ,
,DlCk crushed the paper in.his hand, and not
wishing to litter the floor withthe paper put it

.,.turned and suggested a game of whist to pass

passage, followed by the steward. The moment
Dick was alone, the demented woman, who must
have been on the watch, suddenly appeared ather
door again, and after listening approached the
table on the opposite side of which Dick sat, idly
ﬁngering his cards.

“You think me crazy, because the owner of this
yacht has deluded you into that belief,” she said,
in a low, inournful tone. “He calls himself my
husband, and you believe that falsehood, too. I
am not his wife but his victim——-the victim of a
secret organization called the Brotherhood of
Gold, of which that man, who poses as a Wall
Street operator, is the controlling power. Be-
lieve me or not, it is the fact. Several members ‘
of_this organization are brokers, who in that‘
guise are working for but one object—the accu-
mulation of gold byany means, no matter how
criminal. One of the members has just arrived,
and the boat in which he came is ﬂoating. along-
side now. It is the purpose of the master of this
vessel to offer you coﬂ’ee before you retire for
the night. That coffee will be drugged, and should
you partake of it you will fall into ’a death-like
sleep, and durin-tr the night you will be launched,
overboard to ﬁnd death in the Sound. Take heed,
then, that you drink it not. He will drink with
you. Manage somehow to exchange the cups and,
then watch what effect it has on him. The evi-
dence of the truthfulness of my words will then
be conclusive. Your life will be saved, and to- I
gether we will fly this vessel. Then will I be
able to defeat the purposes of this villain, and
return to my home and my child, who is surely
heart-broken over my mysterious disappearance. -
Hist!_ I hear him returning. Forgetnot my '
warning, for your own» sake as well as mine.’.' .

' In another moment she had vanished like a
shadow into her room, while Dick stared afte
her, more astonished than ever. -

CHAPTER. V.—The Drugged Coffee.

reentered the cabin. '
“You are tired,, doubtless, after your rough

I have made a good deal of money in the
stock market within the last year, and in addi-
tion‘ have a considerable private fortune. Con-

,way’s purpose was to rob me of it all, just as he

and his associates have planned to rob as many
of ‘Wall Street’s rich men as they can catch in
their net.” - . .

“Well, ma’am, if I had a life-preserver, or any-
thing buoyant that would help me keep aﬂoat, I
make .the shore all right.”

_“There is a life-preserver attached to the cabin
wall on either side of the stairs facing the wheel,
where we came up. We will return there and,

I if you. have a knife, you could cut one loose.”

“Why not cut both loose and put one around
yourself, then I could manage to getnyou ashore,
too.

The lady hesitated. It seemed a great risk for
her to undertake. The darkness of the night, and
the roughness of the Sound, intimidated her.-

“I dare not attempt it,” she replied.

“You can’t sink with a life-preserver around
you. and I will see that you get ashore all right.”

“But now that it is so dark, and the yacht has
probably changed her position since you came
aboard, can you tell in what direction the shore.
lies?” r

.7‘Why, it lies

Dick paused and looked into the gloom that ap-
peared thick enough to be cut up into chunks.

To save his life he couldn't guess in which"

7!

direction the Long Island shore lay. When he

came aboard the yacht lay with her head point-
ing southeast, or directly toward the easterly
headland at the mouth of the bay. The turn of
the tide, with a possible change in the wind,
would swing her about‘ in the opposite direction.

Or she might, at that moment, lie midway be-

down the Sound. , l l /

While puzzled by this dilemma he suddenly
thought of the compass card in the binnacle. No
matter how the yacht lay that would show him
the direction of the shore.

“I can tell, ma’am,” he said.

«“How can you?” .
‘ “By the compass in that brass hood facing the
wheel. That will give me the bearings‘ of Long
Island. The vessel may swing in any direction,

 but the compass needle always points in the same

direction. It is pointing toward Connecticut, con-
sequently the Long Island shore‘ lies in the op-

posite direction.”
“That is quite true. I did not think of that.

~  You will be able to start in the right direction;
" » «but once aﬂoat in this fearful darkness will you

notlbe all at sea?" The waves will turn you

They slipped back to the vicinity of the com»

didn’t have his own clothes on. consequently 
had no knife with him. He mentioned the. diﬁi‘-‘
culty to the lady, at the same time taking‘ the.’
ring he had found in the ﬁsh out of his pocket , W,
and slipping it on his ﬁnger again.  '
“I can’t return to the stateroom for In own-.
clothes because the visitor to the yacht, w 0111.15.
recognized as a Wall Street broker, and a former.
boss of mine, has gone into the cabin, and iseprob-.1
ably there now, unless he has retired to 8. state.-,
room, so I don’t see how I’m goin to detach one
of these life-preservers,” said Dic . , 3' ._
“We seem to meet obstacles on every hand,” she’
reilitlied, much disconcerted by this fresh diﬁi-‘
cu y. _ _ 
f‘Wel1, as something has got to be done I'm .;
going to slip down the stairs and see if the ‘new-7 .

“Better let me go. It’s safer.” '

n

_“All right. If the cabin is empty make val”;

going back to the room where my clothes‘ ‘are.

She nodded and slipped down the stairs. ,.

Looking into,’ the cabin she saw that there was;
no one in it, so she signalled the fact to Dick.
She went down and they entered together. .

“Return to your room, Mrs. Ward, andjea
me to look after myself,f’ said Dick. - p 1 »

Without waiting to see whether she did sosbr.’
not, the young messenger entered stateroom~ ‘
and locked the door. He stripped to the ‘skin, {nit

the cabin before entering it again.» The lady”wa,‘s

\

about his friend Joe. The iustice heard his story

-in no little amazement, and was hardly disposed * .-
to credit it. He wouldn’t take’ the responsibility,  »

of issuing a warrant for the arrest of ~ the.
yachtsman, even on the boy's positive statement

that Conway had- given him drugged coffee for  

the purpose of doing him up.

“Why should he wantto do you up?” asked

.«“That will come out at his examination 'be- if

- “I have heard that the gentleman ‘who owns

 vwith the outcome of his application.
°’=‘Not without you can submit some real evi-

dence that the lady is perfectly sane, and is un-
lawfully being deprived of her liberty.”

"I’ve told you all I can.”

“Then I am sorry, «but I can’t oblige you..”

“You are doing the lady a terrible injustice.
It may cost her her life yet.”

The justice shrugged his shoulders. Finding
that, he could not be moved, Dick took up the
matter of his friend Joe.

-“Perhaps you will advise me what steps to
taketo ﬁnd out what became of him after the

» wrecked sailboat was swept out into the Sound'.’_”

.. “You had better communicate the facts tohis
, ‘ family and let his father make inquiriesabout
 'him. If your friend escaped from the storm,

- either by being picked up by some craft, or cast

ashore somewhere on the other side -of the Sound,

' he will return home as soon as he can get there;

I*i'4he,.was drowned, his body will be found as
soon as the tide throws it up.” ~
‘ f§I_f;. his body isn’t carried out to sea,” said

‘ Dick.“

‘ ‘..*,‘.4E)f course. .There’s a possibility of that,’? ad- _

mitted the justice. . ’ _

Dick left the home of the village justice very
much dissatisﬁed. As he walked along he deter-
mined to hire a cat—bo-at and visit the yacht. His

I object, of course, was to rescue Mrs. Ward with-
out le al authority if it could be managed. He
had h s doubts about the success of this maneu-

- ver, for it was probable that the lad would be

i kept locked up in her stateroom, an he would

 ' not be permitted to see her.“ However, he felt
"I that it was his duty to make the attempt at any

rate. Accordingly he went down to the wharf to

" engage a boatman. He also had another duty to

erform and that was to ex lain to the boatman,
rom whom Joe had hired t e sailboat the after-

, noon before, how the craft was lost in the storm,
and how his companion was missing under cir-
cumstances that made it doubtful if he ever

i .. would be seen again alive. He ex ected that

“ . the ,boatman would give him Hail Co umbia, and

perhaps make a demand on him for some money
to help make his loss good. The latter possibility
' did not worry Dick much, for he had heard that
all the “box-itmen had their boats‘ insured, and in

a case of_ total loss would be entitled to recover at
. least eighty per cent. of their appraised value.
. When Dick reached the wharf he learned that

p ' the‘ boatman in question had gone off in another

* , \ craft lookin for the two boys and his property.
‘ He hired a. cat to take him out to the mouth of

,~. the‘ bay. About half way there he got a good
"view of the entrance, and to his surprise saw no
. sign of the anchored yacht. They went clear out,

but the sloop was nowhere in sight, Her oom-
mander, for reasons,’ had pulled up his anchor
fuand slipped away, and so Dick returned to the
village-much disappointed and full of sympathy
for the lady. I,

CHAPTER X.—“I’m Ruined!”

W On his way home that afternoon Dick stopped‘

in at the little bank on Nassau street, which had

a brokerage department that kept open till four , A
o’clock, and left his order for 100 shares of M; & I

G. stock at the market, now 81, depositing his
certiﬁcate of deposit for $1,200 as security. After
supper his friend Joe White dropped in,to-see
him, and learn about his experience on the yacht.

“Do you really think there’s anything iunjthat ,i

“Well, the lady maintains that there is such 9. ' V "

combination of Wall Street men who are en-
gagedin a secret -conspiracy to rob certain
wealthy people of the Street.”

“I should imagine that -was a pretty daring 

game.”
“It is certainly .a risky one.” '
“How does the lady ﬁgure in the matter?”
“She told me that she not only had a fortune

of her own, but had recently made a lot of ‘money; ’ if

out of the market. She has.been operating

through a broker who she believes is a member"

of this Brotherhood. At any rate, he introduced
her to Conway, who appears to be the head muck-
aniuck,’ and soon afterward she was induced to
visit the yacht, when she was made a prisoner.

The object of her captors is to get all her money, ‘ A

away from her.”
,“It' seems to me that this rascally

“No. I’m going to wait till I can lear ‘some-

“Then come on. Let’s go home.” ».
Before he went home he went to the office of the I _
newspaper in which he had inserted the adverti~se- ‘ » “
ment and paid for two more insertions. , '"
There was nothing in the afternoon papers
about the robbery at his office, which convinced
him that the police were keeping the matter quiet. .
Next morning when Dick consulted the market \ 
repotrt he, saw that M. & C. had advanced half a. ’ 7.
poin . ,. ;
“That’s good,” he told himself. “Every little - ’
helps. It shows that somebody is taking an inter-
est in it." .
Things went on as usual thatday. The market‘
continued dull as a Whole, and very little business ..
was done at the different exchanges. {Dick and,’ '
his fellow messengers. had a comparatively. easy
time of it, which, as the weather was hot, they, 

   

grouchiest mood, and the office force found‘
things correspondingly‘ unpleasant. Dick admit-
ted the detective to his room about noon, but the r
sleuth did not stay long, from which fact the boy
concluded that h chad nothing of importance to
communicate on t e subject of the robbery. VASE 
Dick was .passing the Manhattan Building on.,.his‘ ; - ,
way up Wall Street, he saw Conway and another
gentleman come out and proceed at aleisurely  
pace toward Broadway. He followed on behind
them and saw them enter a big cafe on Broadway.
He waited awhile, and when they didn’t come
out _he went in and looked around. They were -.
standing at the bar drinking and talking. Dick ’
went outside and waited ﬁfteen minutes longer. ‘
Then they came out and jumped on a‘ Broadway
northbound car. . ' , g‘ ',
Dick caught the same car, sat down near the :/
door and pulled his hat down over hiszforehead.‘
The car went up to Twenty-third street and
then turned off eastward, which was a sign that ,_,
it was going up Lexington avenue; ‘At Madison" ' 9'“
avenue, however, the two men got off, and so _did» '
Dick. They took a Madison avenue car, and Dick
got aboard, too. When the car «reached a certain
block well uptown the’ gentlemen aiighted, and
Dick followed them to the sidewalk. Half way 3
up the block the men stop.ped in front of a high- "
class bachelor apartment-house. Here Conway  -L,
parted from his companions and went rintothe ; D
building. . ~ ‘ ,.-' ' ‘
»“I guess he lives there when he's in town," ‘,.,U«‘
thought the boy, making a note’ of the number.‘ i
Dick continued up the avenue, intending ,to  I
catch the next uptown car that came along, and ’ ‘. 
go on up to One Hundred and Twenty-fourtl_x'=-‘
street.‘ . As ‘he was passing a high-stoop res-
idence, a very pretty young girl came out and
tripped down the steps.» Some thoughtless personw .

tell how he made his way aboard the sloop; en-‘
tered the cabin, vacant at the time, and saw the“ ‘V ,
lady, who subsequently told him her name was '
Ward, and whom he heard addressed as Ethel by
Conway, standing at the head of the campanioii
stairs looking out at the storm.  ’
" He described: the lady more minutely than be-'

her mother in every way. Dick told-her every-
thing he went through on board the yacht‘ with‘ . "
which her mother had a connection, explaining ‘
such facts about the Brotherhood of Gold as Mrs.
Ward had imparted to him, not forgetting the
incident of the‘ drugged coffee. To say that Edith
Wardwas astonished at his recital would be put-.
ting it quite mildly. Indeed it is doubtfuliif she
would have believed it but for the unaccountable ,-
silence of her mbther, from whom ‘she had re-
ceived no communication, but Dick’s meagerand
unsatisfactory message, in a month. ' ~

Conway. ' . ’ _ ‘

CHAPTER XV.——~Conc‘lusion.

7 Althoughthe. destination of the sloop. wastin-
 -known to Dick, he believed s_he'was bound to some
1 Long Island town. Some time passed before, he
ventured tolift the door of the boiler to look out,

.for he could not tell but one of the ‘sailors might
' -ibe standing close to it, or even leaning on it.

 He looked around the deck. The two sailors
were forward smoking. As smoke was issuing
from a pipe that rose out of the deck the boy
7concluded there must be another manpbelow’ in
;the' place called the galley. The captaifl was
< steering and talking to; ‘Broker Caxton. The
sloop passed through the Narrows, skirted Graves-
end Bay, skimmed out on the lower bay, and was
now practically on the edge of the broad Atlantic
Ocean. . Insteadaof continuing on down the Staten

 the sun" was low down in. the western sky. Dick
-was growing pretty tired by this time of‘ his
‘cramped quarters in the boiler, but he had to put
_-upwith it. The sloop appearedrto, be a fastsailer,
“ forvshe made good_t1me. It was after sundown,
andone of the sailors had taken the ,Skipper’s_.

of Rockaway Beach. In the meantime the cap.
tain and Broker Caxtonihad gone into thesmall
cabin and eaten supper, served» to them by a
':rriu1ai3to cook, who also stood on watch and did a
spell at the helm later ‘on. It was now, so dark
that Dickxventured to get out of the boiler and

“When do you expectrto reach Jo-nes’ Inlet

“If this wind holds, and I reckon it wi1l,%wei
ought to fetch it about ten o’clock,” replied the
skipper. f .. "
“The yacht lies just inside, I believe," said f
Caxton. . ’ V "
“She’s anchored behind one of the islands..’.’ ,
“So, that’s where she is,” thought Dick, .wh’o'i
had easily heard what passed between the twb. .
men. “Rather an out-of-the—way place.-' ‘I am 4
not surprised that the detective who is looking for
her failed to ﬁnd her anchorage.” ,  —
More than two hours dragged away, and than
the sloop was headed in toward the shore. T 
Twenty minutes later she passed through the
inlet into the westernearm of Great, South Bay”-
‘and soon shot into a passage between two. of the.
manyislands in that vicinity._ Behind the rlargefrr i‘

up the stairs to the quarter deck.

‘ A ' ’ “There are three men beside the skipper aboard

‘:1 The Mysterious Valise

By Col. Ralph Fenton

. .“Sentry, will you kindly keep your eye on my
 for a few minutes? I am going to have a
plunge in the Serpentine,” said a well-dressed,
.m'rddle—aged gentleman to me, one warm ‘summer
morning, a few years ago, as I was on duty at the
park gate of Knightsbridge Cavalry Barracks.
="“A11 right, sir,” I replied.
‘ before you return, I shall hand it over to the next
sentry.”
‘Oh, I shan’t be more than half an hour, at the
V test, as I must be in the city by nine. I prefer
leaving my valise with you. There are so man
»vagabonds' always swarming‘ about Hyde Par
that it is quite possible one of them takes a fancy
=1:'o it while I am bathing. It doesn’t contain very
'.’IIa'.luable property—0nly a suit of clothes and a
 documents of no use to any one but the
ci‘m1er, as the saying is. All the same, however,

have no desire to lose it.” So saying,.the gentle-
Juan, turned away, and walked briskly across the
. ‘park in the direction of the Serpentine.

‘About half—past eight I perceived a great com-
motion in the park. Men were rushing from all
'qu”ar.ters in the direction of the Serpentine, and
soon, afterward I ascertained from a passerby that
the excitement was caused by one of the numerous
-hagthers having been drowned. An uneasy suspi-
. ion‘ was at once excited within me that the per-
son ’who,had come to such a sad end was the

‘which suspicion was intensiﬁed when I was re-
' ‘_e_ve'd- at nine, with the article still unclaimed. I
‘ ected, however, that its owner might have
__‘ ‘ chained to the scene of the disaster by: that
ind}; id curiosity, which induces people to linger
ﬂirt th'e'spot‘where any calamity oftthe kindvhas
, ’_c'ently occurred, and then, ﬁnding that he was
pressed for time, and knowing that his property
vgoiild be perfectly safe, had gone direct to the
c .’ . '
’ .l1anded over the bag to the sentry who re-
_. e, without mentioning to him anything of
7'e circ Instances. of the case; and when he re-
, ned from duty at eleven I eagerly asked him
“the valise had been called for. _ .
g‘.‘No,” he replied. “It is still lying behind the
wall.” . ,
, I went on sentry again at one'o’cIock, and no
“qnehad come for it. It was the height of the
Landon season, and Hyde Park presented its cus-
teéirgary  appea_rance;y but the imposing array
fusplen 1 1y appointed equ1pages,kdash1ng eques-
tlians, and fashionably dressed ladies and gen-
‘-ﬂe.men, which at other times'was to me a inost
gnfherestirig spectacle, that afternoon passed by
-;u_1deeded,”'as all my thoughts were centered on
‘ggculations regarding the fate of the owner of
" ‘bag. Before being relieved at three, I had it

Qgigveyed to my room in the barracks, and after »

;ii9"r_tling oﬁ’ guard, placed it, for greater security,‘
nxthe troop store. I That evening‘, before’ “sta-

you while on sentry this afternoon,” was the cor-
poral’s answer. , .

After stables I left barracks for my customary
walk,.and purchasing‘ a copy of ,the Echo from‘ a,
‘Juvenile _news vender, I read the particulars of
the fatality of the morning. Friends had identi‘-' ‘
ﬁed the body, which was that of a gentleman
named Nixon, who had resided at Bayswater.

“Nixon! That corresponds withlthe initial ‘N.’
on the bag,” I thought to myself, now perfectly‘,
convinced that the deceased was the person I had
seen in the morning. I also ‘ascertained from
the newspaper report that a man {had been ap- i
prehende on suspicion of having attempted to
riﬂe the pockets of the .clothes of the drowned ; 
man, and who had been roughly handled by the ,
crowd before a policeman could be procured to W
take him into custody. After a moment’s reﬂec“-»
tion I decided to call at the address given in the

. paper in order to arrange about the restoration ;

of the bag to the relatives of the deceased. _,
Reaching the house, I knocked softly at the’
door, and stated my business to the domestic
who appeared, by whom I was shown into a room,
and immediately afterward was waited upon by a V
young lady, the daughter of the deceased, who, '_ . "
naturally enough, was perfectly overcome with  .
grief. .I explained to her in a few words the ob- 
ject of my visit. ‘ . r  ~ I _
‘‘I [am uncertain whether poor papa had fa, 7
valise of that description when he left this morn? '
ing,” she said, “but possibly you may recognize '
him from this photograph,” submitting one she " "
took from the table for my inspection. ' V  - '
The young lady thanked me heartily for the  ~
trouble I had taken in the matter; and .1 le?f_t~tl;1ef 
housegof mourning and returned to the barracks; ” ’
in a very mystiﬁed state of mind.  ‘V
Next day I attended the orderly room and» res = ;
ceived a severe admonition from the commanding» T
officer. Fortunately for me, as it happened, Sir" j, ._
Carnaby had been in plain clothes, so my offense; 
in the eyeof martial law, was of a comparatively 7
venial character. Immediately afterward I c"o1i'-'

 
  

communicated with the police authorities latvscot-=  j
land Yard,’ and that evenin , pursuant to instru_c- -
tions received, I had the ag conveyed to that’:
establishment. .,After I had explainedkhow it was
placed in my charge it was opened ‘in. m .- re-f

, sence by an official, and was found to conta1n'Just\
‘a suit of old clothes and a-few newspapers, .but

no documents of any kind, as stated by its owI1e'r,'»
Some time afterward I ‘was on Queen’s Guard},
Westminster. I had just mounted my horse, an
taken up position in,«one of the two boxes,facin¢.. '
Parliament Street, when a gentleman stopped'_o’pf‘--
posite me and scanned me curiously. Addressing
me, he said: “Don’t you remember me?” Q _,-5
There was no mistaking the voice. Itwaslth

I r "I. will try,” he said. . ‘
* I received permission and one of the corporals
on guard received orders to accompany me; so to-
I','”g-etner with the gentleman, we started, and,
I crossing the street, reached,the police headquar-
/ tors in‘ a minute or two, and on making inquiries
' were directed to the “Lost Property” department.
.I We ,s1;ated our business, and an ofﬁcial, after re-

 
  
   

ceiving an assurance from me that the applicant-

'- was the right person, speedily produced the valise.

that his ‘property had been restored to him, giv- V

I up his property and we‘ left the office.

slipping a sovereign into my hand.

I “Well,” said the man—-whom I at once Tsar-p

We entered a room in the interior, and the

LAFTER SEEING NAME IN NEWSPAPER AD
 three-line notice in a discarded newspaper
found on the docks of Copenhagen has resulted
1 in a fight for a $5,000,000 fortune. '
.'Bruce' Thorborn, twenty-year-old sailor, has
' xéhhsted the aid of Max J. Mosloow, Boston law-

 

,,through his father’s will.

The newspaper notice told of'the death, in’

Perth, Australia, of James D. I. Tliorborn. It said
is left a $5,000,900 estate andvthat zhis nearest oi:

Thorborn has a small photograph of his motha ‘ ,

1 er, which she presented to him just beforesha 
died at Seattle, Wash., about seven years ago. On‘ ,

the back of the picture the mother had written: ' "

Bruce, “God forgive me. Born Aug.'5, 1908,

Perth, Aus., of Ena Hopkins and James D. I., .'."A’>

Thorborn.” V

 

 

 

Thorborn told Moskow his mother never ex-.

the James D. I. Thorborn mentioned in the news- I

paper notice was his father.
The lawyer\, is seeking additional information

from Australian authorities in the hope of su’p- Aw

porting Thorborn’s claim.
