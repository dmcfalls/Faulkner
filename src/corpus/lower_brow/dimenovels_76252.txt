4 OR, RUNNING HIS FATI-lER’S BUSINESS ‘

‘By  SELF—MADE MAN

 

“It’s a wonder your mother didn’t try to sell ‘
the store.” .‘ i ‘

“She did try. Quite a number of would—be
purchasers made offers for it, but none of them
was willing to give anything like what I ﬁgured ,
the business and stock in trade is worth. Every-, 5’ .
body seems to think that it’s the proper thing . I
to take advantage of a w0man—to do her, in fact .
—and when that woman is a widow they look
upon her as a fair mark. Well, I’ don’t propose 
that my late father’s business shall be sacriﬁced.‘

  
 

it over with mother, I persuaded her to ‘let me
step into my father’s shoes and get on the job." 
“I wish you success. Who's been running it f,

“Mr. Grafton, the bookkeeper. When I take
full charge on Monday, thesﬁrst thing I shall do’
will be to ship him.” _ ~.,

“Ship the bookkeeper! How can. you get on 
without him? He’s been inthe store a longtime, ‘_ s
all of tenyears, I guess, and ought to know the  
business from A to Z. I should think he'd be \ '_
just the man to help you out.” I I

“I know it. He’d help me out—of the business" .'_
altogether.” _ Z 

“Why, what do you mean?” , i . _.

“I mean that Mr. Grafton is not the kind of'_., ' "
‘man I want around. Since he’s been running;tl_i‘e" ' ‘
store ‘for mother he’s been working for hisowir
interests more than hers.” * :

“He has?” ;..-.

"‘Yes; he’s a sneak. He ke t straight under.
my father, because he didn't are do otherwise.
But since he’s been in charge he’s been  -

things to the ground."
“Why should he do that?” .
“To discourage my mother with the_ view, no.
doubt, of buying the store out cheap himself. I ‘
dare say he represented things to the people‘ who‘

.Wanted to purchase so” as to queer their‘ oifers

and prevent them from getting the store.”

“Have you any proof of that?” -  ,

'1 “Yes, I have proof‘ or I wouldn’t say so... I-.{
have proof, too, of his general duplicity. .He’s
a ‘snake in the grass, and has; overreached la’ ,

her actions, azed at theink as_if expectinglsome; ‘ I

remained just what it was-—a drop of ink. The 
gypsy appeared to regard it as a black mirror . "
in which her eyes saw what was not revealed to ‘ ’ _ ,
others. Three pictures of future events she de- y 1 
scribed with great accuracy to Tom. The boy
was rather staggered by some details, in one
which he knew to be true, and that lent an air

of credence’ to what he otherwise would have » H
laughed at. What she told Tom we will not now '

tell all that was to happen_ to the boy, forshe ‘ '
did not attempt to draw the veil further than the
point reachedby the third picture; nor could she
tell what lay between the events her mystic
powers had evolved from the drop. of the ink. 
The girl who was to ﬁgure so prominently in‘ . ,
Tom's life she described with as much accuracy
as though looking at her photograph,.and the boy
was rather pleased to hear that she was uncom-
monly pretty and ‘accomplished. The third pic-
ture was a thrilling one, but when the woman-
reached ‘the most critical point‘of it the sudden’ ‘
appearance of Mrs. Nugent caused Tom to move‘;

 

 

 

ﬂoor, and that brought his fortune-helling seanqe. 
to an abrupt conclusion. ’ . . ._.- ‘
 §‘She’s been telling my_fortune, mother,” said
Tom, in some little confusion, for he was a bit; ..
ashamed of having yielded to the temptation of '
such a thing. ’ » 'f
. .‘His mother smiled indulgently. She did not put, 5
any great faith in such things, although when a. ;

l he 'couldn’t make his _escape that way, so he
I‘ {rushed into the counting room, and dashed for
the back door, where the continuation of the
lley lay. Through that he made his way to a
ack street, and hastening to his rooms, packed
 ‘his trunk and took a train out of town. In the
' fmeantime, Mr. Jones, the salesman, alarmed by
 'Billy’s cries, rushed back and asked him what
‘- " ’, ‘was the matter. Billy explained matters iii great
agitation, and Jones entered the private ofﬁce
 and found Tom insensible, looking pretty bad.
’ ,He sent Billy post haste for a doctor, and then
I __proceeded to try and revive the young store
manager. He was successful in bringing him to
_ ..his senses. Tom declared he felt all in, but
 . managed to acquaint Jones with all that had hap-
‘ pened between him and Grafton. By that time
Bill brought the doctor back with him. The
* ,ph sician carefully examined Tom’s head, and
‘ was soon satisﬁed that there was no fracture
_of,the skull. After binding the boy’s head up
. {he gave him something that braced him up, then
told him to lie down and go home when he felt
"able to do so’.

v: half hour till you feel better, then make it every
_.hour. , You’ll be comparatively all right to-
.in'orrow.”' ,
* He took ‘his leparture, and Tom sent" Billy to
the drug—store for’ the medicine. Jones brought
‘ ~a'blanket for him to rest his head on, and then
', closing the door of the office, he went to the tem-
. phone and notiﬁed’ the police of the occurrence.
ahdasked them to arrest Grafton. By that time
"Grafton was on the train a mile out of town.

‘. told to him. . \

One morning Tom was ‘standing in‘-the front 
part of the store talking to Jones. At that me; I <

merit a nurse maid with two little girls in 7

charge came down the street. She stopped to
look in at a window where some pictures were 5“
displayed, and the children walked on ahead. vAn .-
automobile with two men in it came slowly down.
the street abreast of the maid and the children.,
Suddenly it came to» a stop, both men jumped
out, and while one of them rushed at the‘chil-
dren the other stood between them and the maid.
The little ones took to their heels screaming with 
fright. The man singled out one of the two,
named Daisy Adams, and reached for her. The V
screams of the two girls attracted Tom’s atteii~
tion. He rushed out of the store in time to see
one of the kidnapers pick up little Daisy.

“Drop her, you rascal!” he cried, darting for-
ward, but the man's companion blocked him. ~*

During the excitement that ensued the first i T
rascal sprang into the auto with his victim and, * j
after‘ a hurried glance at his companion, started ’
off at full speed. i 1 g_

 

CHAPTER VII.———0n the Track of the Kidnapers.

Tom gripped the kidnaper’s accomplice around ,'
the waist, and the man dug his ﬁngers into the V
boy’s hair to make him release his hold. In this ,
way they struggled around on /the sidewalk in’ 
front of the store, while the nurse’ maid ran ,_
screaming after the fast vanishing auto. Of’ 
course all this created great excitement in.that lg.-
neighborhood. Storekeepers and clerks ran to‘ ~ 1
their doors, people upstairs threw up their win-
dows ‘and looked out, while pedestrians stopped ,
and gaped. None of the latter oﬁiered to help V 

Tom. Indeed they hardly knew what had'hap-' ,,
pened so rapidly had the game been ulled off.
Jones, however, came to Tom’s aid, ut Jones ,.

was an old‘man of limited muscular power, and‘ ,
he could not do as well as some of the spectators 
had they come forward. The kidnaper’s accom- 1 7
plice, seeing his danger, lifted Tom oﬁ his feet _
and swung him around at Jones. His legs hit 
the old man, and he went down like a ninepin. ~ ’
The rascal then succeeded in shaking, himself’-V 1;
free of the boy's grip, and, throwing him on top
of Jones, started for the nearby corner, around.
which he disappeared in a jiffy, just as a. police- .4
man hove in sight up the street. . i ,1 -
Tom was on his feet in a moment and, seizing.‘ :
his hat, which hadfallen off, darted in chase of;
the ﬂeeing accomplice, determinedsto ‘overhaul
him if he could, and land him in the hands of a1 ‘
policeman. The boy could run some, and he g,‘o't..
a hustle on in his eagerness to catch the rascal.’
The fellow crossed the street and hurried down;
the next one. This led to'the water front where
there were some very common houses. Thefman
kept straight on, with Tom rapidly overhauling «
him, till he reached the middle of the lastblock .-
in that direction, ’ Then he darted into a ,cheap'*

therascal was‘big’ger and stronger than he. _He
 as"satisﬁed that this chap and his companion
were the "two men who had tried to get_into _his
, store, for he_had heard them plan the vkidnaprng
- . off the little daughter of a judge, whose identity

was at present unknown to him, but which was
V su;'e.to come out in the newspaper.’ The abduc-
. ; tion was apparently a success so far, but Toni
;. V hoped that if he could capture the accomplice the
 rscheme might be defeated. Both rascals were
/, . badly wanted by the police for the laying out of
"  the three oﬂicers, and he would be doing a public

" ‘Tservice if he could get the man he was after.

. _,“’He’s in one of these rooms at this end of the
_ hall,” thought the boy. “The only way I can_get
 at him is by looking into the different rooms till I

._ ,hit the right one.” ‘

.C‘:"’ He started opening the doors, one after the
other, and found them all unoccupied. The win-
 now of the end one was open, and Tom suspected
‘that the rascalghad entered that room and had got
out at the window. He ran to it and looke_d out.
.CHe«was just in time to catch a glimpse of the
’ fellow vanished down an alley toward the
~'~~wharves. Tom saw that he had made his escape
. by sliding down the leader at the corner, a couple
 [of feet away. ‘ _ _ v
 ’- “If that pipe held him it’ll hold me,” muttered
. '- the boy. “I sho ld miss him entirely if I return-
’ Med to‘ the stree and followed him around the
’ .- thlofck.” ,
 So Tom stepped out of the window, grasped the

,pl-pe-jand slid slowly down to the alley. As soon

as his -feet touched ground he continued the
chase, though the fugitive was now out of _sight.
:-When he emerged from the alley he saw the
‘ ‘rascal, walking rapidly "along ‘the water-front
about half a block ahead. He followed him at
a walk for fear the man would look around, catch
jsight of, him running, and surmise at once that
lhewas on his track again. i ‘

  
 
 

 

 

 
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
  

, ’  There were many sailors and other habitues
‘ _. of ‘the’ docks along the thoroughfare,'and by keep-
- ‘ ing-some of them between him and his quarry,

 he hoped to be able to approach the scoundrel
unobserved. He saw the fellow look behind sev-
eral times, and then, as if satisﬁed he had thrown
‘his pursuer off his track, he reduced his pace.

‘ _Tom‘7 gradually neared the man,- but was very

‘showed up, nor did’ his man reappear. Tom grew

That was a chance heihad. to take and hetook it?‘ ’
He reached the back door without attracting no«.. ,
tice, and slip ed into the kitchen just as the»
woman bade t e men good—by. The auto started’ .
down the lane and Tom slipped into the entry. "
back of the kitchen and shut the door. He heard" i_
the woman come into the kitchen and start to.
clean up. I
‘.‘That will take her some little time,” thought .
the boy. “I will take advantage of it to make *
my way upstairs and search the rooms for the
little prisoner.” _ _.
Striking a match on the leg of his trousers.
he saw a back stairway in the entry. : ‘ 
“This will answer all right,” he muttered, re"-.g .
moving his shoes and then starting up‘the ﬂight,
which creaked under his weight. ' t ’-
He went slowly and cautiously in order to I
make as little noise as possible, lest the woman
might have sharp ears, think the sounds sus_-_
picious, and come into the entry to investigate.
Nothing like that happened, and Tom reached
the landing above without misadventure. ‘He;
found a door_facing him and, opening it, dis:
covered that‘ it led into a vacant room above the’ ,
kitchen. Another door opened on a small apart- "

. ment on the opposite side. This appeared to be 

used only as a store room for 21 miscellaneous as-J I ‘
sortment of traps. A third door admitted him to

a short hall that brought him to the front of .
the house where the main stairs were‘that came
up from the front door. .-

. There were two doors off this landing. Both ' .
were furnished in a somewhat meager way, and, '-
there was no sign of the little girl in either.‘
There was a stairway to a ﬂoor above, built only
The ﬁrst door that
Tom came to was locked, but the key was in7it'. » »-
“I’ll bet the prisoner is in here if she’s in. the '
house at all,” thought the boy, turning the key,
and opening the door. 4 ’»

He was right. He struck‘ a match and looked

around the room. Lying on a cot, fast asleep, 

with traces of childish grief on her face, ~was'the ~
little girl Tom had vainly tried to save from be-" ,.
Tom gent-

ly roused her. Her scream would have echoed 

over her mouth. 7 I‘ / ) , ,
v‘‘Don’t make a noise, little on'e,”lhe,said inJre-f‘;
assuring‘ tones. “I’ve come':to take you home, to‘ ~
your papa and mamma.” I ;«

Her paroxysm ceased at once, and she became xf

"tractible, though she could notsee Tom very well

in the dark.
‘ “What is your name, little girl?”

_“Daisy,” she ﬂuttered. / , ,

“Daisy what?" ’ I '   '
* “Adams. ‘My papa is Judge Adams. Do take,

I After the lapse of nearly half an hour Tom
éleft his hiding place and started to look around.
SHe saw a hole in the rocks where the crooks
jkept their supply of provisions. To investigate
further he had to pass the men. Smith lay on
his side with one hip thrown up. Front‘ his
pocket peeped the butt of his revolver. Tom won-

awakening the rascal. It would come in plenty

The two rascals had already made them ou 
and though the young people weretoo far ahea 
to be recognized, the kidnapers believed that the ’
girl was their late prisoner, and whipped up toy».
overtake the pair. Tom dragged Ruby into the  J
bushes, and there they crouched dgwn, hopin
they had not been seen. When the wagon dash ..
up and stopped almost- in front of then‘ lace-jof _

; concealment, and the men jumped out an ran to- .
’ ward the bushy screen that intervened, Tom knew 
that further hiding was useless. . 

So he drew -the revolver he took from Smith,. 
rose out of the bushes and confronted the. scoun-1'4 ‘
drels. Both of the crooks started backaghast on‘ «
beholding his face. Presuming he was/dead: inn‘
the pool, they thought this was Tom’s ghost. ; _'

“.T_hr‘ow up your hands, both of you, or .I’ll"
shoot,” cried Tom, "raising his arm out of‘ the ,

. bushes and covering them with the muzzle ofthe j;
revolver. .Smith was unarmed, but Shackley: 
clapped his right hand to his hip pocket andhf.
pulled out his gun. Tom wasn’t taking » any 3 .
chances with the rascals, and the moment he’ saw‘ A

‘theglint of the weapon he ﬁred point blank at 

- .Shackl'ey.: The ruﬂian dropped the revolver, *
clapped both hands to his chest, and with avcry
‘fell to the road. , /,1 ‘ ‘ ' "  ' »;

“You'll get the same dose if you don't hold up .

 Tom stepped over to the buggy to get. the piece
 “bf rope he had seen lying under the seat. '
 _ “Now,” he said, walking up to Smith, “drop
nyo-ur hands and put them behind your back. Do
7 _-as ‘I tell you,” he added, threatening the rascal
.. miwith his revolver. “After What you chaps did to
ﬁne I’d just as soon shoot you as not.”
' ‘ The buggywas provided with a small extension
ack, and across this space Tom managed, with
.5 uby’s help, to place the wounded and uncon-
lbcious Shackley. Tom assisted Ruby on the seat,
, {and after securing Smith so he couldn’t get away,
7 ‘and would have to follow the vehicle on foot, the
 — boy took his place besidethe girl and started the
c ' lhorse toward Barpoit the houses became more
‘ Erequent, and theymet more people who stopped
. ‘. and stared at Smith tagging on foot behind the
" ’ lbuggy because he couldn’t help himself. Finally
they reached the town, and Tom drove straight
[toward Judge Adams’ house, followed by an in-
icreasing mob of the curious.

Just before Ruby's house was reached the
icrowd became so large that Tom had to pull his‘

_  on the leaders and order them to keep back.
" A , he approach of the buggy and the crowd was
1 9' noticed by the servants of the Adams’ house, and

7 lthe judge's attention called to it. The moment he
ieaw the girl in the vehicle he surmised that it

. was his daughter, and rushed‘ 0111‘! of the house
 zinuch excited. A couple of policemen came down

 B. side street at this juncture, and the odd sight
'_,)natura1ly attracted their attention. Tom stopped

’ sand beckoned them over. '
. . “Keep the crowd away, will you, officers? I'm
bringing Miss Adams home, and I have caught the

j ltwo kidnapers.

’ ‘ ilbut I had to shoot him in se1f-defense.’’

, The whole police force on duty had heard about
the. abduction of Ruby’ Adams the night before,
and every detective in the city was out looking
for her. The oﬂicers cut the crowd oil’, and Tom

 droveup to the gate in front of the Adams’ resi-

dence just as the judge came running down the
walk. A moment later Ruby was in his arms. Tom

7 did not stop to make any explanation, leaving

 ’_ that for Ruby to do.

:; He drove straight for the police station, accom-
 aanied by the two policemen as a bodyguard. Tom

,  ad now acquired an undoubted reputation in

 . ‘town, ‘and he was admitted to be a most uncom~

Anon young man. Nugent’s hardware store was

: ‘icoiisidered the place to deal at, and Tom was

" Tom now called once a week regularly on Ruby,

and Mrs. Adams quickly saw that he and her

, Tdaughter. were deeply in love with each other. She

‘ Ztoldher husband, and they agreed that, as Tom"
',«‘was an uncommon ﬁne young man, and was bound
‘ to make his mark in life, matters could take their
"course. In due time Shackley recovered from his
‘w'o11nd.and was placed on trial with Smith for the
abduction of Daisy, and they were convicted and

he should give bail for George.

Mr. Williams immediately sat down and wrote
a note to the lawyer, to be taken back by the
messenger, that if he gave bond for his son he

would have to make itrgood himself, as he would ‘
not more spend another cent for the defense of '

the wicked boy. ..

“I have worked hard,” he added, “for my money
and don’t propose to waste it on drunken boys, if
they are my own.” _

That night the town marshal went prowling
around the town for young fellows who had wit-
nessed the ﬁght and encouraged it to notify them
to appear in court the next morning and pay any
ﬁne the judge might impose upon them. .

Some of them were youths under age. Others
were young men who were of legal age and who
knew that they would either have to pay a ﬁne
or prove in a satisfactory manner to the judge
that they were not there designedly.

‘ The next morning there was another crowd of
excited citizens in the village courthouse. Jimmy

and a few of his friends came in. Sally Holmes ’

and Mrs. Watson were also among the number,
having come in to town in Jimmy’s buggy, while

Jimmy and his boy friends drove in with the ,

Jersey wagon.

Lawyer Johnson met Jimmy and asked himif
he should represent him the second time. ' .

“Yes, Mr. Johnson. If I need any representa-
tive at all in the court-room, why, ‘I want you to
be that man.”

“All right, Jimmy. Don’t' worry. I have

picked up all the facts in the case, and you need ..

not worry at all about the expense. The marshal
tells me that there is no charge against you, as
he was a witness of a part of the ﬁght and will
swear that you were simply acting on the defen-
sive and were, therefore, not to blame.”

The young lawyer was making much capital
out of the cases, and was satisﬁed to do the work
freeof charge. - *

One of .George’s friends came to Jimmy and,7

asked him what he was going to do with George.

“Not a thing. He is in the hands of the law.
I only acted in. self-defense and will simply tell
my story to the judge.”

“Well, wha in thunder did you take him back‘

to the station-_ ouse for?”

asked.

“Why, you could have turned him over to his

friends.” V

“Nonsense! His friends were present and en-
couraging him to break my neckfor me, and._‘I
unders and that they have almost to e man-been

notiﬁe’ ‘to appear before the judge and pay such‘ . 

ﬁnes as he may see fit to impose upon them.”

“Well, if George were a boy of mine,” retorted V

_  Someof Jiiiimy’s -friends reported to himithat

him and that he had better look out.

‘ “All right,” said Jimmy. “I am on the lookout

.- ,?rown because he is a much stronger man than

’ , and I have always regarded him as a danger- _‘

i “Here, Jimmy,” said one of his friends, “you '

take my stick until I ask you for it,” and the

young man placed an exceedingly strong hickory
cane in J immy’s hand,’ saying:

 ' “Use it if necessary. There is no danger of

‘ its going to pieces when used on a. , an’s head,”

. "and with that the friend went awa ,' leaving his

 powerful stick in J immy’s hand. » -

left in his hand rather admiringly and remarked:
~ “It's a pretty solid weapon. 1' hope I_won’t

' mother and Sally Holmes had stoppedand helped

 J “Why,_Jimniy,”

are you doing with Mr. Emmonds’ walking-cane?”
 “He lent it to me to use-, if I should have need
of it," said Jimmy,Awith a broad smile on his

face. , 8 . .  l

HIGH AIR ROUTE T0 EUROPE PROPOSED} .
TO EVADE STORMS ,

A regular transatlantic ﬂying service  ‘ ‘
would not be at the mercy of bad weather is en-_ .
visaged in connectionjwith the experiments pro-_-1
ceeding in Germany for the perfection of a plan

capable of ﬂying at an altitude of from 30,000

40,000 feet at a maximum speed of 300 miles an!  

hour. V i '

A machine starting out for Paris from New; ‘
Yorkwould ﬂy by way of Boston and Halifax 
to a point in Newfoundland. At all times duringi‘  .
this 1,0 —mile journey the plane—an ordinary’.
land mac ine—would be in touch with emergency . I
landing ﬁelds, and the trip would be no moray -
hazardous than ﬂying to Chicago at present. Inn‘ “-
Newfoundland passengers, mail, etc., would pbei
transferred to a high altitude, ocean-going; aiJ.'_\‘
-liner. I »
It is argued that the next stage of the ﬂight.-—-, ‘._ -'
across the Atlantic by the northern route—wouldn 
not only ﬂy above any bad weather that could
possibly form, but would make the distance in ‘an.
far shorter time than is at present possible by a. ,
machine ﬂying at a lower altitude. This is ac- 1- ,
counted for by the higher speed which it is hoped, »

mosphere. It is also held that the time use,d‘in.f,:
ascending to 30,000 or 40,000 feetwould be motel 
than compensated for by the saving made pos-,
sible by the increased speed. '

After completing the 1,900 miles of ocean cross-... _ »
ing, the high altitude plane would descend ing '.
Ireland, whence passengers would be ﬂown in :
laiznd planes’ via London to any part of the Cone‘
tent. ' v ; ’ "

The first test planes, made entirely of meta
are} small in proportion to thehuge high altitude’
air liners for the proposed. tra_nsatlantic.servinc,
In‘. the body of these planes ‘is a sealed cabin’,
comfortably furnished, -for the passengers.‘ A:
blower system is provided to supply oxygen when
rareﬁed air is reached and‘ is operated in ‘con-
junction with the heating and ventilation ’
