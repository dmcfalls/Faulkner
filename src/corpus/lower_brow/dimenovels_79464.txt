CHAPTER I.

A Mv§raR‘1oU‘s MESSAGE.

‘alonein the house, save for the presence there of Joseph

I.

the valet, and the other servants. ‘
, It ‘was a warm, pleasant evening in September, and

. Patsy had taken his icliairioug on the‘front steps to enjoy

his cigar the betteryiin the

’ pen air ;- the darkness had
only just fallen, "Chick was absent’ from the «city and

was not expected to return for more than ta ‘week more,
‘and the detective himself had gone ‘out early in the day,

leaving word for Patsy that he would return early in the

evening. The second assistant was aivaiting his arrival,
‘while he smoked his cigar on the front steps of the house.

Presently a messenger—boy rode up to the curb  fiionti
of _‘the house, dismounted ‘from his Wheel, Stationed it,

(against the curbstone, and then ran up the steps and
gave a crumpled‘ bit of soiled brownpaper into PatAsy’s

ioutstretched hands, 3‘ /_

atsy was obliged to take the note inside the hallway

 cider to read‘ it, and even‘ then he found ’-some dif~
lﬁculty in decipl1ering_it, although the moment he caught

   

slmeanin he was not lon in imbibinrr its,entire con-

‘Patsy Garyan, Nick Carter's second assistant, {was

into a ball, and the writing upon it; although unmista-jg
kably in the hand of Nick Carter, bore evidences of haste _ 
‘ and 9f extreme diﬁiculty» in writing it. ‘ ' * 

The ‘message. was short, too, and erctreinely unsatisfac-V-V 

prise. »

: 9 it "
The paper on which it was written had originally

served ‘as part of a piece of wrapping-paper, and had "[7
away to supply the jpurposév ‘

evidently been torn hastily
it-now ﬁlled. ’ T

‘ Itxwas ragged at the vedges,'of no particular shape at” 

all,_was badly soiled, it had been crumpled as ifrwadded ‘V

to_ry‘.’ It readas follows: \ T ,

« “Come to me at once: This boy will lead the way. 
gjuess they have got,me this time, al' A

can hold out till you get to me and bring help. See Billy J’
St'udley. Wire for Chick, if you don’t ﬁnd mekat once.

I can’t tell you where I arn, for I don-’t know, but the

boy who picks this up will be able to tell you where he
‘got inf V v . ‘ r . N.  .

 Patsy had to read the note over twice before he that-

oughly mastered its contents, and he-returned
front steps with a jump. ’ ’ A  r »
I “Here, boy!” he eérclairned to the urnessenger who
brought the note. “'Ilell me about this.” ~ T 
,W“Tell you about it .5" asked the boy, in~ap_parent etsujr;
“What shall I team you jabout it?‘ If’the message

Some of the intensely interesting stories of Nick Carter
in the pa‘ have had to do with sea-diving, and here are
some facts connected with that business which, we believe,
will be of real interest to our readers. I

“The dangers and terrors of diving have ever been the‘

V subject of _ miich visionary exaggeration. v Men who have
 , spent their lives in subaquequs performances agree that the
profession is, if anything, “far less dangerous than many

a‘ «which are carried on upon dry land.

’To be a good diver, a man must be slight and wiry, and
havea strong constitution. So long/_ as there is no organic
,disease,, the occupation is by ho means an? unhealthy one.

H As a matter of fact, serious accidents seldom occur, pro-
_, ‘vided ordinary care is exercised. The perils of divingﬂare,
iv  for the most part,’ entirely imaginary, ifonly small matters

are attended to as well as big. A 
T A very popular error ‘is ‘with regard to the beauties of

‘got abroadare hopelessly extravagant. The enchanted daz-
izling halls, whose pearl-paved courts are graced with dainty

. "meigmaids, are composed of slimy sediment, sand, seaweed,-
 and other stiénge but» scarcely beauteo1is'objects of the
ideep. A, T T M ' ~
