By A SELF-MADE MAN.

 

CHAPTER I.—Hal's Narrow Escape.

,_ “Say, Hal, you want to keep your eyes skinned
 for Titus Gregory. He's down on you like a car-
. load of bricks.” said Will Chambers.

. “Tell me something I don’t know, Will,” re-

lied Hal Halman. “I’ve not been asleep since
came here, and I can read a man as well as
the next one. I know he's down aonme, but I
_ haven’t given him any cause that I know of.

However, I_don’t care, and won't lose any sleep ,-

V over the matter. I’m not afraid of him, or any-
’ ‘thing he can do to me, for I attend to business
right up to the handle, and the boss is perfectly
Zsatisﬁed with me.”
. “Well I thought I'd warn you, for I’ don’t want
‘ to see éregory get his hooks into you. I don’t
- like him myself even a little bit. He’s got a bad
'- eye, and in my opinion is not a man to be trusted.
I don’t see how Mr. Glass ever hired him as his
cashier. If I was the boss I’d be afraid to trust
_',him with the key of the big safe, let alone the
_', general management of the counting-room.” ‘,
., The two boys had just arrived at the oﬂice in
V», {W all Street,,where they were employed as mes-
‘ _ sengers by Broker Glass. They were particular
5 friends and traveled around Harlem,,where they
* both lived, a great deal together.
, ‘ ~ At the time we introduce them to the reader
‘ they were in their employer’s private room look-
ing out of the window at the stream of clerks

   

 
 

*7 and girl stenographers on their way to work in

 the various buildings in the neighborhood. The
~ ‘frequent opening and shutting of the door oif the
corridor in the next >room,,where a space was
; railed off for the accommodation of the customers
and other visitors, indicated that the clerks of
V the office were dropping in fast. The last to ar-

rive was Titus ‘ Gregory. He was a man of
“ average build, with a dark, saturnine face, which
:-never bore a. ~‘ood-natured smile. »

  
 
   
 

N 'I_ieath beetling brows, and the stubbly mustache,
 which failed to hide a cruel mouth, bristled more
ike ﬁne quills than hairs. I-Iewas not a favorite
'1': the office among the clerks, who‘ feared, his
3. roving glances, and mimhd their F3 and Q’s even
when his back was turned on them. Mr. Glass

 

  
      
 

and his executive ability and sharp business tac-
tics enabled him to fill the bill to the’satisfaction
the broker. He looked around the ante-room

His black,'beady eyes twinkled restlessly under-I

A when Will, with an _ejaculation of alarm

as he walked toward the counting-room gate, ‘ -2
and noticed that the messengers were not in their:;
seats. A frown settled on his countenance. With- ‘L
out a friendly nod to a soul in the room he went .
to the safe and opened it without hangin up; ‘T
his hat. The clerks came up and got their ks
and papers as usual. ,
yet?"‘_‘

  
   
  
 
  
  

“Haven’t Halman and Chambers got here
he asked the second book-keeper. . ‘ i ,
“Yes, sir. They were outside when I came ‘in.’
“They’re not outside now."
“Maybe they're in the private room.”. ,
“What are they doing in there?” asked
cashier, sharply.«
“I couldn’t tell you, sir. They go in there:
sometimes before work begins.” ~ 4,
, “Thev do eh? I’ll teach them to stay wherrﬁr
they belong, almost hissed Titus Greg‘ory..
He strode out of the counting-room and crossed ’
the waiting-room. There was a savage glare in
his eyes that boded no good to the boys.. "At
that moment the young messengers had spiedla, I
couple of girl friends of theirs on the opposite
side of the street. They put their ﬁngers to
their mouths and uttered shrill whistles to at.-
tract the attention of the young ladies.

This wasn’t the first time the fair stenogra-,
phers had been saluted in that way by thélllg
and the misses looked up,, recognized them,
smiled beamingly at them. While the two boys
were at the open window, laughing and waving.‘
their hands at the .two girls in the street, Greg-V - :,
ory entered the“ofﬁce. Picking up a ledger he ‘
stole behind the boys ready to deal Hal a bow.
He stood there with the heavy book poised in
both hands, and a ﬁendish look on his evil face.

He had been waiting a long time for an ex-
cuse to jump on the lad with both feet, and be
gloated over the fact that the time had come ﬁt
last He hated Hal with all his heart, and for
reasons which only himself lmew. He meantttou
lay the boy out good and hard, and was only
waiting for Hal to turn and see him. It hap-
pened, however, that it was Will who turned‘
around ﬁrst. Although he had heard no " p
in the oﬁice, something seemed to tell him that
they were not alone. He looked around and p_
ceived the presence of the cashier and his men;
acing‘ attitude’ toward Hal. =
i Seeing that he was discovered, Gregory ,‘ "
about to bring thebook down on ,Halman’s,

the ..

considerable‘ force. The end of the book hit Will’s
warm‘ and bore it-down‘ like~a ﬂash, while the

aout of the window, after striking the sill, only

Qback. ' , . . _

Instead of expressing any gratitude to them
_he turned on Hal, with a face purple with rage,
‘and ordered him out of the room, biting his lips

 

pose. Will walked after him and joined’ Halat
;’tiiei'r chairs. ’
“‘I saved you from a broken head that ti_me,"’
he said.
~,’~_“Was he going to hit me with that book?”
‘ asked Hal.
 “Was he? Well, say, there was murder in his
eyes,” replied Will with solemn earnestness. “I
'._never saw himlook that way before.”
 “Surely he didn’t intend to hit me on the head
wit}: that ledger?” said Hal. “Why, he might
-;.have killed me.” ~ _
V “He was aiming at your head. ‘I had only
“just.time to shove you out of the Way when the
.i book, came down‘. My arm is numb where he
, struck me,” and Will rubbed his lame arm vig-
orously.
. C“He’s a vicious rascal,” said I181.’ “One would
-think I’d done something particularly bad to him.
SI guess you were right in advising me to look
out sharp for him, for it looks as if nothing
would suit him better than to do me up.” -
;‘‘That’s what I think; and I never thought
so more than now.- He certainly has it in for
you, and he's a bad man to have for an enemy.”
 .At that moment the‘ cashier called Will and
sent him_out with a message. Soon afterward
Hal was handed a bunch of stock certiﬁcates
to carry to three different transfer ofﬁces. When
he" got back to the oiiice there was an envelope
waiting for him to take over to the boss, who
was’ at the Stock Exchange. The market was
-' ely that morning, as one of the stocks had
boomed several points. »
fj‘It»happen_ed to be a- stock that I-Ial’was inter-
ested into the extent of 100 shares. A broker
-.for'_whom he had done a special favor a‘ month
before, had tipped him_'oﬂ”_ to a coming rise‘ in
‘the stock, known by the initials of D. &_R., and
~Hal,_who was something’ of a small spéculator
n the, quiet, had put up all his capital, $1,000,
svmarginal security, on the shares. He had
bought them, ten‘ days before at 86, and they
werenow going at 94,‘ Naturally he feltgood
when he _saw that the expected boom had set in.
At this stage _of the game he was $800 ahead
mixhis deal, not counting expenses, and judging
from what the broker told, him, he expected to
make $1,500 at any rate. While’ he stood at the
rail waiting to deliver his‘ note, the price went
up half a’ point more. _
‘ There was a lot of business done in .the board-
oioni that day, for the lambs we-re coming down-

After. he got off for the day

and told the margin clerk to sell his shares. at

eleven o’c1o.ck-next morning. He signed the or-- _'
der to that eﬁect and left. A few minutes after _
eleven on the following day the" market suds,‘

certainty all day as to the fate of his deal. Not ,
until he visited the little bank at ten minutes" ' "

at the top price of 102 and a fraction.

est amount he had made in any

of his previous
deals was something over $300. . . ’

L CHA'PTER II—Robbed.

“Hal, I want you,” said‘ Mr. Glass one» after-, I

‘noon as the two messengers were calculating that
it was pretty near time for them to ‘go home.

“Yes, sir,” replied Hal, jumping up and f01__  .

lowing his employer into his private room. '

“I want you to takethis package to Edwin 

Black at his home in Newtown, New Jersey. ‘His

address is on it. He lives near the center of,

the ‘village, two blocks from Main street. You
will cross over to Jersey City, and take the New-
town and Westlake trolley car, which you will.
ﬁnd within a few steps of the ferry entrance.

Here is a dollar to pay your expensgs. You may 3,

keep the change. Start at once.”
“All right, sir.”

“Be careful of that packet, for it c ta" 
$1,000 United States bond, which beino; oi1:‘mth:', .

coupon kind, is easily negotiable. Put it. in your
inside pocket.” ‘ ,-.

0 Hal walked outside, told Will wherehe was
going, and left the office. 5 '

A sporty-looking man of perhaps twenty-ﬁve .
years, who had been standing at the 'cashier’s ’
.window_ for as ‘long as ﬁfteen minutes talking?!
in a low tone to Titus Gregory, started for the

door as Hal passed out into the corridor. ‘I114.
‘stead of taking the elevator he ran down the”
’stairs and landed in the main entrance of "the 

building at the moment Hal stepped out of ‘the
elevator. The,

left Wall Street, and purchased ferry tickets one
after the other and» boarded the same boat. '.

Reaching the other side, Hal found that there

man_waited till the car was on the point of’
starting with a dozenpassengers, and then he
got on andseated himself, beside Hal. »It was
quite a ride to Newtown, and the trip woul

 as he pushed the paper in front of his eyes.
He then talked glibly about _the past perform-
ances of the new men,_and about the relative
Jinerits of the other leading teams of the league.
. Hal listened to him and concluded from his talk
Iivthat he was a died-in-the-wool fan. What he
’ didn't know about baseball seemed. hardly worth»
considering.’ He also wondered if the fellow was
a street salesman, or perhaps a professional bark-
er for some summer show, for he certainly could
talkvliké a house aﬁre. And‘while he kept up
his talk the car .went bowlingalong at a rapid
rate till it stopped at the junction of two tracks.

the other of the towns. .

the conductor. _ . ‘
“I’ve got to get out here,” said Hal, getting up.
“So have I,” replied the sport, following him
out. - ‘ . A
The car behind was not in sight. .

“Take a, soda, anyway,” urged his -companion.

The sport looked disappointed.
" “Ever been out this Way before?” he asked.

on board. Half an hour later the car stopped. I
at the -head of Main street, the end’ of the’-route,
and Hal, followed- by the sport,- alightedc‘ 

“I’ll inquire in this store where Mr. "Black
lives,” said the young man, heading Hal off.-as ._
he was about to do the same thing. Hal, how-5
ever, followed him in. The only person inthe
store was the proprietor, and he was ﬁxing some
of his stock in Atradeat the far end. The «sport

“I knew I was bright,” said the \other, whenﬁi I

he returned. “He lives down facing the lake.”

“I asked for Edwin Black, retired lawyergoi

“By the way‘, I haven't asked your name; Mine
is Gabe Case.” I ~-
“M name is Hal Halman.". I
“T anks. Now we know each other,” said Cas‘e.;,"'
“The lake is over this way." ' ‘ ”

Hal, wondering how it was that Mr. Glass

had directed him wrongly, accompanied his talk-

» ative companion. Inside of ten minutes they cazne

in sight of thelake, glistening in the last rays
of the declining sun. They passed several pretty _
homes standing back in extensive grounds, one.
of which was Mr. Black’s. ‘ “; '

Clearly Gabe Case had some special reason for“,
leading ‘Hal down to the lake.’ When they reached].
the water they saw a number of ﬁne villas facing '
the lake, which was quite a large and charm-
ing body of water. Hal was quite taken withit,
and also with the several handsome little 's1oo'p_s
moored ‘off the ends of the privates wharvesi
He was something of an amateur boatman, being I
a member of a Harlem yacht club, whichhad a '
club-house and a number of sloops at the foot
of one of the streets ending at the North River.

“That's Black’s place,” said Case, pointing at
one of the residences, which was embowered in
trees.

Hal accepted his word. for it, and entered the

, gate when his companion held it open for him.

As he passedvthrough he received a tremendous
clout under the ear from Case’s first which
stretched him dazed upon the shrubbery; In" 3.
twinkling the sport bent over him, riﬂedfh.
pockets of the package, ‘gave him another sniasli
in the face, and skinned out at the gate- 
Hal soon recovered from the rough handling
he had received, and got on his feet to find him-
self alone. 'His ‘astonishment and anger at 
unexpected assault was great, and he could we

Hal to Newtown and robbed him of the bond, but f 4-
owing to the young messen'ger’s alertness had,;=._’*
failed to get away with the goods. —  1

He went into the counting-room and questioned’ 
the cashier about the man. Gregory was shrewdl 
enough not to deny the conversation, but declared. ’~

‘he had never seen the visitor before. 'He stated;
in general terms what had passed between them,
and that was all that the broker could learn from-‘_ _
him. Mr. Glassy communicated the fact, and "‘-:3
Case’s descriptio;i,'to the police, and asked that

made any effort in that direction nothing cam “
of it. Somedays afterward Hal noticed‘ the.‘

the_..tock was a gilt-edged one and decide‘d"to,.
take a chance on it, so he purchased 200 shares7
at the market price of 105. " ’

Next day it was up to 108.’ Hal thought of ;"
cashing in at that ﬁgure, as he had no line fond,
the stock. He hesitated, however, as the chances’
looked good f'dr a further rise. He held one..-
few days longer, and when it went up to 111 aifid;
a fraction, he sold out and cleared $1,200. Tha ,

I returned and bade him follow her. She took him

“Bring George Halman’s son here and I will

“You would swear to anything, Titus Gregory,‘
to gain your point, but your oath, like your

snapped his ﬁngers. ’ ~ ‘

“Say you so?" cried the cashier, his ra e mas
rtering him, “then l.et me tell you that I wil marry
Vivian King in spite of you, or I will bring‘ ruin

As Andrew Goodman was ,about to make .a;‘

with a slender but well-molded ﬁgure, and an
expression of tenderness which cast a halo\".of‘
loveliness over her features, entered the room.

duced to Andrew Goodman before her marriage
by her prospective husband. ’M:I'. Goodman their
lived in’ Brooklyn and was a‘ produce broker. ‘He.
was a man of about forty-ﬁve‘at that time. She"
had never Spoken to Hal about Titus Gregory‘
who had wooed her at the‘ same time that George
Halman did. _Greg'ory, eve'n_when turned down’.
by her, had given her no intimation of~wh‘a-t;_his‘ -
feelings were on the subject, non of vhisrveng-efiu
intentions toward his cousin, the successful wj”

Whatever he did,- he did in the dark, by under

the new cashier, whose name was 'Gre'gory,"w'as
treating him, he did not mention his first name
and so is mother did not associate this in‘
with her disappointed suitor, whom shezhadffn
seen or heard from~for over twenty years. 7‘ Now
however-,‘her eyes were opened when Hal related
the events of the evening. , " -‘:3  .‘
“Then you did not suspect that the cashier of

shabbily, was Titus Gregory, my fathers cpusigjz,

harge of the oﬂice. After attending’ to his cor-
respondence he went to the Exchange. The early
afternoon papers had the story of the shooting
f Andrew Goodman by Titus Gregory, whose re-
lationship to the wounded man/was given. The
acts were rather meager,‘ though several re-
vportcrs had interviewed Vivian King early in the
drning. When the papers went to press Greg-
ory had not yet been arrested. I§ef.ore_ he went
‘home Hal wrote a note to Vivian inquiring about
«Mr. Goodman's condition, which the papers stated
tovbe-favorable, and telling ‘her that he and his
inother would call whenever he got Word from he!‘
‘that her guardian was able to see. them. He
'”-mailed the note on his way to the Sixth AVeI1119

I -So after supper that evening-' Hal and his,» 
mother went up to the Goodman house. Hal rang "
the gate bell and the old woman let them in‘. -
wit‘hout question. They were ushered’ into the’ 
parlor. Vivian appeared in a few minutes and _’
gave Hal aiwarm greeting. Hal introduced his
«mother, and then ‘the irl took them both upstairs
to Mr. Goodman’s be room. '

“Guardy, this is Hal Halman, son of George
Halman, your nephew," said Vivian. ‘ -

Hal approached the bed and took the old man’s
hand. The money-lender did not speak at ﬁrst,

. but ‘gazed earnestly into the lad’s frank and open I "

countenance. - \ ‘

“Yes,” he said, “you are indeed my grand- 
nephew, for you have your father's features.“ “
Welcome to my home, my dear boy. For years ‘
I have longed to see your father again, but"
now I know that can never be, for Vivian tellsi .
me he is dead—that he died many years ago in
California, where he went tolive with his bride.”‘ ,

"Yes, sir; and here is my mother, whom yo'uj'— i‘
once met as Agnes Bassett, but so long ago that 

  
 
 
  

 

“Welcome, my-dear,f’ said Mr. Goodman. “As 7
the widow of my nephew you will ever become'~
welcome in this house.” i  

The old man asked many questions of Mrs. 
Halman about her husband's brief career in Cali- ,
fornia. She told him that her busband had start— " 
ed on a good business in Oakland, but that though _ 
it prospered at first it proved a disastrous failure — 3;.
inside of the year owing circumstances which ’ '
her husband never divulged to her. ‘ ’ 
' “Your husband was deliberately ruined by a
relentless enemy,” said Mr. Goodman. »

’ Mrs. Halman looked startled.

“That enemy was George’s cousin, Titus Greg- ;

ory, who hated him because he had won you for

  

  
 
 
 

“Never,” replied Mrs. Halman. . _

“It is the truth, for the rascal’ himself told me, ~-_
last night before he shot me that he followed his, ’,','
cousin to California in order to ruin him out of

revenge." _ .  _. , __
~.“He’s _a reater villain than I ever dreamed he _
was,” said al. ,. '

“He is worse even than you have any idea,” _-
said the oldman. “I trust he will be ‘found by .
the police and put behind the bars." ' 

“You will prosecute him, I suppose?” , ’

, “I will, for I have a greater motive even than
the injury he inﬂicted on me. He is a shrewd’
designing villain,‘ but he made a fatal mistake .
when he attacked me. Were the wound twice as «
bad I would welcome it, as it has resulted in}
bringing you to my house. It was my intention .
that my Vivian, who is the dearest little’ girl 
the ‘world, although no relation‘ whatever» to me
should inherit all my property; but now that you
will not object to

Judging from the way the girl ‘took that an}-‘

‘nouncement she evidently had not the slightés

objection to the arrangement. , Indeed, there wa

_not a selﬁsh‘ drop of; blood in Vivian Kitig’s bod

Had herguardian said he intended to give the
bulk of his property ,to Ha1’she would notsliave.

  
   

V lmurmured against his decision. Hal‘ and his
mother stayed as long as they thought was. good
« ‘A for the old- man, and then took their leave, prom-
ising to call again before long. The days passed
away and Mr. Goodman recoveredfrom the effects
of his wound. He truly ‘believed that Vivian had
saved his life by shielding the most‘-vital parts
‘of his body with her own. Hal called frequently
until he ‘got on his feet again andy resumed busi-
_ness. Perhaps the presence of:Vivian had as
much as anything to do with his visits, for to see
and converse with her was to learn. to love her,
She was such a sweet and gentlecreature, with
. ‘none ‘of the wiles of the world about her.
',o:ld man had raised her like a choice plant in
the conservatory of his home, and she had

" bloomed into a girl of unusual loveliness. Small

, her.

 

7" ‘ CHAPTER IX.—The'Burglars.

 

. One day, a few weeks later, Hal carried a mes-
‘sage to a broker in the Vanderpool Building in
Exchange Place.
" “I want to see Mr._Kirkman,” he said to the
oﬂice boy. ,
. “He is engaged with a visitor. ‘Take a seat,”
v replied the youth.
, ', “Well, you can take this note into him, can’t
‘.y01'1?” ‘said Hal. ' ‘
I '. ‘‘All''rig'ht,’’ said the boy, taking the envelope
' "and knocking at the door of the private oﬂice.
, ' T He was told to come” in. In a few moments he
. returned. .
'‘‘He will have an answer for you in a few min-
utes,” said the boy to Hal. V I
_ Hal nodded and walked to the partly open
window to look out. While he stood there he
heard apart of the conversation going on in the
‘ privateroom, for the window of that office was
’ also partly open. . _
“I think that's all, Kirkman,” said a voice. “Get
W on the job at once and buy every shareof L. &

"you when to stop. Understand?”
“Certainly, Mr. Price,” replied the broker.
“All right. There is nothing further, so I’ll
get over to my oﬁice,” said Price, who Hal be-
lived was the millionaire operator of that name.
He was certain a moment later when he saw
;the gentleman come out and go away. ‘
“I, guess I’ve got hold of a bang-up tip,” thought
the young messenger. “Mr. Price wouldn’t give
" that order unless he meant business. Evidently
some syndicate, of which he is the head, is
' going to try‘ and corner that stock with the View
of» booming it, and afterwards unloading on the
lambs. I must get in on the ground ﬂoor with
i the insiders, and hold on till I judge they are get-
ting out from under. If I work the trick all
.1‘ig‘ht I shall make another good haul, and prob-
ably double my capital.”
 At that point in his reﬂections thelboy brought
..iiim the‘ answer from the broker, and he started
back for the office. When he got off that after-

-That .evening‘-Halrjwent, up to Andrew 

 

 

man’s house, where he was welcome at all-times, .. .
to call on Vivian. The aldman was pretty.shg-e_w_tl , 
he saw with half an eye, as the sayingis, that
1-lal was greatly taken with his ward.‘ He.chi-1Ckled- ‘
to himself as if such .2. thing hadpleased him
greatly. Hal had already won his way into the’ . ;
money-lender’s heart, which was inclined toward 
him from the start. ‘ ' ' ~_
Mr. Goodman saw that the young-lmessenget. _. _r
was a ﬁne young fellow in every way. He had "
not acquired any of the smallvices of youth, and, - I

 

"he gave every promise ofturning out to ‘be a true

andupright man. as well as a smart one, 'That‘-
was the kind of person'-5M/r. Goodmanconsidered
a. worthy mate for his little girl, as _he a.ﬁ"ection- T
ately called her. As he had just added a codicil 7
to his will dividing his possessions at hisdeath "
equally between Hal and Vivian, he figured that i
nothing would suit him better than to have rnade“j'.
a match. As Vivian received Hal's visits ‘With
pleasure the old man had great hopes that thing": ‘
would turn out to his satisfaction. .’ .
There was an alley running upon one side. of
the" grounds to and beyond a small gate where
tradesmen’s clerks were admitted-by ringing .a_
bell. To savethe old woman, or the gardener and-
generalphglper, the trouble of going to the front .
gate to a mit Hal when he ca led, the boy was '
intrusted with a key to the side ate so he could
admit himself to the grounds. n this evening’
Hal entered the alley as usual and walked for-
ward in the darkness. Two men, oneof whom
was in the‘ act of hoisting the other to the ‘top

of the fence, heard his approach. , _

The immediately crouched down close by and
waite to see who the newcomer was, and what ’
business he" had —in the alley. Never dreaming
of their presence, Hal took _out the key and -1111-,
locked the gate. He was about to pass in when
one of the men glided forward and struck him
a blow on the head with a slung-shot. Fortunately,‘
owing to the darkness, the blow was only a glanc-
ing one. - I *

Nevertheless it was enough to put Hal out of
business for the time being._ He dropped_.senae,-

  

 

, less in his tracks and lay still. .

“I’ve ﬁxed him,” said a voice thatsounded like
Titus.Gregory’s. “He must be a new servant the
old man has hired, otherwise he wouldn’t ‘have.
a key tothis gate. Drag him out of the way,
Gabe, and then we'll walk in andattend to our
business. Goodman little thinks I am so 'riear~
him. Neither have the police any idea that Iain;
in the city. I have sworn to get square with the
gld dgtard, and this night I shall strike myﬁrst’
' ow. 

The speaker’s companion was Gabe Case,"the'
sporty chap whom the police of both New‘ York
and Jersey City had hunted for in vain. afterthé
bond affair, seized hold of Hal and pulled him.
out into the alley. The two men then entered?
the grounds and closed the gate after them. '— . 

Gregory looked through the window of Mr.
Goodman’s' oilice. The Moorish lamp burned‘ Iow-
above the closed desk, and there was no sig'n*i¥o
the money-lender in the room. It happened t f

and it _didn’t take/that individual long to get the
window open without making much noise. The
two rascals then enteredthe rcorn. Gregory tried
the door leading into the hall and found it was
not fastened. He listened‘ for some sound that
would indicate the whereabouts of Vivian and the

,. old woman. Hearing nothing he Judged that the

‘ »:girl was either in the sitting~room or in her own
apartment, and that the housekeeper was in her

 “Maybe two hours.

' “I’m afraid the old man will be back before the
two hours are over. ‘we’ll have to let the safe go

‘ Then wel_’ll ﬁre the house and make off.” '~ ‘
v‘ The sport got the desk open in short order and
;»Gregory began running over the documents he
 init. He did not expect to»ﬁi‘id‘any -money,‘ .
but his object was to _do as much ll’lJ\11‘y as pos-
sible to his uncle’s business. While the men were
busy in the room a face appeared at the, partly.
[open window.‘ It was the countenance of Hal
ﬁalman. He had recovered from the shock of
the blow and entered the grounds through the
gate, which he found unlocked. He reasoned ‘that
~he’lia‘d been attacked by one or more men_ who
 been hanging around the place for _no good
(purpose. He be ieved that the rascals had en-
red the grounds through thegate he had un-
locked after knocking him out.‘ It béhooved him,
hen, to be cautious in his movements, and in-
stead of ringing the front door-bell,’ as he would
have done but for the unexpected turn of events,
, investigate the premises and see if anything
crookedwas going on." Walking to the ~back_~of}
he ‘house, as the most likely place to make such’
.a'*ais‘cWery, the ﬁrst thing he did was to ,look
’iﬁto.Mr.— Goodman's oﬂice. p ' "
There he saw the two rnen——one at the desk
and the other gliding around the_ room _in a

bered that. the old gardener had his quarters
there. ‘ »
“I'll go over and get’ him

_ He acted on the idea at once. There was »_a
side door which opened on the stairway leading ’
up to the rooms above the floor where the‘car- , ,
riage and two horses were kept.‘ This was locked, V: 
but ‘there’ was a bell which Hall pulled. In a>
minute or two he heard steps of the oldfi/n_an_
coming down the stairs. The door opened andf“
the gardener stood there in his‘ shirt sleeves.
He did not immediately recognize Hal, whom -he .

‘.‘What do you want?” he asked. ~: V
“I am Hal’ Halman; don’t you know me ?” ,
“Yes, Idoinow," ‘ 7 ' 
“Have you a revolver in your room?" . ‘_
f‘A revolverl’? exclaimed the old man in stir‘-3
prise. ' T
“Yeas. There are two rascals in Mr. Good-
man’s oiﬁce riﬂing the room.‘ I just discovered,‘
them there. We want to put. a stop to their
operations and capture them if we can.” ' T -’ .
The gardener uttered an exclamation
sternation. _
“I know both of the scoundrels,” went on;t
boy. “They are wanted by the police for crimes
tlieyhave already committed. I ’might as well
tell you that one is Mr. Goodman’s nephew, Titus
Gregory, who shot the old gentleman a few» Weeks
ago.” . ~ ‘ _
_ “My goodness!” .  .
, “Get your revolver, if you have one, and let
me have it. Also fetch something that will;
swer for a club.” I . I
The gardener said he ‘had a weapon and would
bring it down. He went back upstairs for it
and—pre_'sently it was in Hal’s hands. It was, a
he_'a_vy;*six—shooter of the navy pattern,’ and -3 fo‘
mida le looking weapon. The gardener‘ then

I A CHAPTER X.——-Hal Balks the Burglars.

.:“'I‘.itus Gregory ‘was still seated at the desk  .
a pile ofpapers before him which he‘ was tying’
up to take away for future examination at
leisure. Gabe Case had ﬁlled a suitcase he found

_in a closet with the choicest portable treasur,

of the room, of »which the oldﬂmoney-lender Ilia’
many_whi_ch_he pI'lZ8d. for their rarit moreTth‘ai'i
their intrinsic value, which was cons‘ 1-able.’ Hal
and the gardener caught a good view’ of them
through the window.  ' ‘ -  T
-“Ihave a. key to the kitchen door,”,said\"the
latter. ’“We will enter that way and then: fw
can come unexpectedly on them.’ _ K r 7 ,
He openedthe door and led Hal inside.lThei_\
they passed into a wide entry which divided the
ground floor in half. The -kitchen, pant 
dining-room were on one side, the,oﬂice an 
lor wereon‘ the other. 1A capacious -cell'ar, ran 
der both. They crossed the entry with great can
tion, -and H,a'l.laid~h,is hand on. the door or]

“They have locked themselves in to prevent in-

’ zterruption and sudden discovery,” whispered the
boy. “You had better stand guard here with the

ﬁitchfork, while I will go back and stand them

 up’ at the window.”

The gardener agreed to that and Hallleft hini.

: When Hal looked in at the window again the suit-

case and the bundle of papers stood on a chair

‘within his reach. The rascals had. placed them
"therein readiness to grab them up the moment

they started to beat their retreat. Having accom-

“ plished part of their purpose they were both now

preparing to finish the business. They were pil-

, .ing a mass of crumpled—up paper and light draw-
"ers from which they had emptied the contents

' door.

‘would obtain sufficient headway to ultimately de-
stroy the house.

Their object was evident, They intended

, “The infernal scoundrelsl” breathed Hay.
“Gregory knows there’ are two women upstairs

‘~ whose escape might be cut oﬁ’ before they were
j ‘ aware of their peril.”

The window was now all the way up so that

. the rascals could quickly make their exit. They

were so busy that they did not notice the boy

reach in and remove both the package of papers
and the suitcase.

Having’ accomplished that, he
‘brought matters to an immediate issue.
.“Hands up, you scoundrels, or I’ll shoot you

i down without mercy,” he shouted.
‘ ,’Gregory and Case turned around and cast a

startled look at the window. There they saw the

head and shoulders of a boy, whom they did not
-‘-recognize in the gloom, and the dim outline of

a pointed revolver- They started back incon-

-ﬁsternation, and for the moment/did not know

what to do. '
“Hands up, I say!” cried Hal again.
Gregory, however, was a crafty rascal, and

‘ . never more so than. when driven into a corner;
uAs Case threw up ‘his hands in ‘a panic, he threw

up-one, whilethe other sought his hip pocket.
Quick as a ﬂash, taking his life in his hands, he
‘ﬂashed out is revolver and ﬁred at Hal.

Halwas rattled and he fired blindly, missing

«his mark. Gregory ﬁred again, but the smoke of
‘Hal’s discharge prevented him from taking ac-

‘curate aim, and Hal stood unharmed. -Case took

‘advantage of the shooting to make an attempt
; to escape.

Wfivian, from her chair in the sitting—room on

from her guardian’s oiﬁce.

,'She immediately jumped to the conclusion that

Mr. Goodman’had returned home, and was now ’

being murdered by somebody—perhaps his ras-
‘ally nephew, whom the police had not captured.
With. ‘her heart in her mouth, and pale as death,

causing him to drop his weapon. With acry/on ;: g
rage and pain the ex-cashier, who had already 
recognized Hal by the light of the lamp and the _. 
ﬂashes of the revolvers, hurled a. volley of ime 2 
precations at him and then dashed forthe open,
door himself. ‘ » /' . v

Hal ﬁred at his retreating ﬁgure, but missed
him. The boy then sprang into the- room and ,.
started to follow Gregory. ‘Phat rascal had found ,
his companion struggling with the gardener after , s 47’
receiving a slight wound from one of the tinesﬁa .'
of the fork. He jumped in and laid the old man»  
out on the floor, then the rascally pair ranfar
the front door. Here they were blocked until ..
Gregory could unlock it. «I-Ial coming, on the __
scene quickly would have had them cornered only T »
he tripped over the gardener’s legs and measured: ~.
his length on the floor, his revolver ﬂying out ~
of his hand.

Before he recovered his weapon and grasped V
the situation the rascals had made-their exit, and .
were ﬂying down the path to the front fence. Hal  . 
rushed to the door and sent a bullet after each
of their scurrying figures but missed them. i -

They clambered over the iron fence with the _‘“~”~
quickness of desperation and flew down the street.  ¥
Hal went back and helped the dazed gardener to
his feet. While doing this Vivian, who had paused
 fear on the stairs, falteringly asked who was . 

ere. - . .-
“The gardener and I, Miss Vivian,” replied‘-ﬂ 
Hal. “DQn’t be afraid, the trouble is over." * .

“But guardy. is he ” , , , _

“Mr. G.oodman has not returned home yet,” an’ 
swered Hal, who had learned from the gardener '
that the money-lender was out on a business visit,

“Thank Heaven!” murmured the girl. “He is
safe then. What was the shooting about? Who’ -‘
were those men in the house? When did you
come, Hal?” V r ~  '

“I'll tell you all in a few minutes, Miss Vivian.

 
   

which those chaps turned upside down. Come 1
down and secure the front door.” 5
b flit that moment there was a ring at the gate
e . »
“There’s guardy now,” cried the girl running:
down, out of the door and toward the gate. ' , ‘
She was mistaken, however, for the person ‘at V
the gate was a stalwart policeman who had been
draw thither by the last two shots ﬁred by Hal.‘
Hal and the gardener re—entered the oﬂice, and.
the boy pointed to the pile of paper and other,
material that the rascals intended to use for ﬁring
the house. ,
“1Whati do you think of that for rascality?” said

a .
“They ought to be strun up,” said the man.
“They’ll have to be caug t first. Now that the‘
rascals are back in the city I hope the police will‘
exert themselves. Mr. Goodman and his home
are not ‘safe while they're at large.”, ~ ’
Hal told him that there was a suitcase full of
plunder outside the window, and a small bundle
of what seemed like papers. ~

CHAP‘TERcXI.-—A Sharp Trick. .  

The attempted burglary and arson at Mr. Good: .ﬂ 
man’s house was duly chronicled in all the mom- _, ‘I
ing papers. and.H.al' I-Ialman’s name appeared in ‘
connection with it as the person who had balked  ’
the rascals. Will read about it on his way to the ,

oﬂice. . . .
“Gee! Hal /appears to be distinguishing him-V‘ ‘
self in great shape,” he thought. “It's funny how.
he is up against Gregory every time, and then
gets the better »of the rascal. It's singular that-
the police haven’t caught that rascal yet. Just
think of his nerve to make a second attack on
his uncle. He is certainly a bird.” .
_ Hal was already in the olﬁce when Will walked  .,
in. I - . V
W‘_‘l11T see your name in the paper again,” said _ j, ’
i . ' « ‘ i
“ es, did you read about last night’s affair?”
“Sure I did. The story occupied a piiominenll,
place in the pa er. I couldn’t very well miss it.
ave had a strenuous time.” - .
“You can bet I did. Gregory ﬁred twice at me,
‘and one of the bullets came so close to my head
that I don’t see how it missed me. He wasn’t '
ten feet away when he shot at me.” _ * ,
“The paper states that you did some shooting ' "
yourself, and that you slightly wounded Gregory,‘
in the arm,” said Will. ,
‘‘That’s right. I ﬁred ﬁve shots altogether, but
without.much result. I’m afraid I never woul
win a prize in a pistol contest.” _
~ “Shooting at a man-is different from shooting 
at a mark I've heard, particularly if that man has i ,
a gun himself.” ~ ‘ '
“I guess you’re right)’. I «V
“Tell me all about the affair. I'll bet the paper 
didn’t have half of the facts.” _
Hal gave him an outline of the affair, which
was much more complete than the‘ newspaper ac-.
count. By the time he had ﬁnished all the clerks
were standing around listening. The cashier's 
appearance sent them to- their desks, and soon . 1 ._
afterwards both be s were dispatched on errands. V a
Strange to say t e police failed to catch either
Gregory or Case. They had either left the city,
or were stowed away in some secure hiding place.,
At the end of a week Mr. Goodman ;oifered.$1,00,0E  ,
for their apprehension, or for the capture of his“ 
nephew alone. This stimulated the detective force’ 
to fresh exertion, but brought no results. By that
time L. & N. shares had advanced to 95. r That . -~
rise of three points put Hal about $1,000 ‘ahea f 
of the game. « . ~ ’ I
“Iguess I’m a pretty lucky chap,” he told»
“,"I‘he boom I’m looking for ought to,
come soon. . ‘ _
The boom did come soon, four days later. T1165’
stock bounded up to par in an hour one morning,
and set all the trhders by the ears. There was .
excitement to burn‘ that day as the price mounted.

went ~to“106.‘ When” Hal went to the Exchange

‘ with a message‘ to his‘ boss it was up to.108. He
concluded not to take any more chances withit,
but circumstances prevented him from getting

to the little bank till along in the afternoon. L.’

Si N. was going at 110 and a’ fraction when he

ﬁnally put in his selling order. As the inevitable
decline did not come till the following day, he
realized a’ proﬁt of $6,300. That made him worth
$10,000. He told nobody about his success in the
stock market but his mother, from whomhe had
no secrets.

.- m . She congratulated him on his luck, and hoped
it would continue. A week later he noticed that
 M. & H. was going up, an he decided to take

a chance on it, as it was regarded as pretty good
stock. He bought 500 shares, putting up half
of his capital on margin. As he wasnot trust-
-ing to a tip this time, he did not believe he
ought to risk any more money on it. The little
V bank got it for him at 81, and next day it went
up two points. — ,

Next day was Saturday, and as Vivian had
promised to take a_sail with him on a small’ sloop-
_ yacht belonging to a member of his yacht club,
"  e’ went up‘ to. the Bronx to‘ escort her down to

the cl-ub-house as soon as he got his,lunch at a
‘ restaurant.

As the owner of the boat was not going along,
,‘ Hal had invited’ Will Chambers to accompany

them, telling him to be at the club-house at a

certain time. Will was on hand and was not a
little impressed by Vivian’s beauty and sweetness

when Hal introduced him to her. Hal also in-
troduced several of his club-mates to her, and
 they were all agreed that Miss King was a peach.
The three young people put off to the sloop in
a-small boat, accompanied by a .club member to
take the rowboat back to the landing-stage‘.

“Run up the jib, Will," said Hal, as he began
removing the stops from the mainsail.

,‘In-a few minutes both sails were set d the
4» boat was heading down the North River under
’ la ‘smacking breeze which keeled the little craft

over till the copper sheathing on her starboard

side ﬂashed back the rays of the afternoon, sun.

~ Havdnrr perfect conﬁdence in Hal’s ability to
sail a boat as well as to take care of her, Vivian
yielded to the exhilarating sensation of being

whisked along over the sun-kissed water at a
lively rate.

A , she covei-ed»~the distance to thekBattery in a short
. 0 ‘time. ‘Hal kept her well out of the way of the
‘ numerous craft in the river, for he was‘ taking
no chances with such precious freight as his
“charmer on board. _ _

, “Now where do you want. to, go, Vivian?” he

- asked“her, as the boat darted into the bay.

“I haven't any choice,” she replied. “Go any-
where you wish.” . i .
“Then we’ll go down the bay and back, I guess,”
answered Hal. — » _
_ He headed for the island where the Statue ‘of
K Liberty reachedits gigantic form into the air.

tiller, went to see what he wanted. . ‘

“Come in and look at him,” said Gregory. _

He m‘ght have said, “Walk into my parlor, said

"the spider to the fly.”

Hal fell- into the trap and entered. Case was
not in the bunk now, but waiting to’ pounce‘ on
the victim- ‘Before Hal knew what was going to
happen he was down on the ﬂoor in the grip
of_the two men. Case gagged him quickly to
prevent him calling out, and then he was swiftly
bound and thrown on to one of the bunks. Will ,
was next decoyed in and treated to a dose of‘ .
the same medicine. A trap in the ﬂoor was lifted
and both boys were dropped into the hold. Greg'- 3 .
Dry thenwent on deck and Case followed him,
going to. the tiller. ' ‘

,“You arewanted in the cabin, miss,” said
Gregory, in his politest tone;
Vivian wondered why Hal wanted her to come ‘

"there, but she Went in without any hesitation.

The place was vacant. /As she stood just inside
the entrance‘ somewhat bewildered,’ Gregory
stepped inside and closed the door. ‘

“I.will now reveal myself ‘to you, my dear Miss

beard. V , ’

. .Thus speaking, Gregory opened the door,
walked out, and then locked it on the outside,
leaving the girl a prey to the most unhappy re-
ﬂections. Below in the hold the‘ two boys were
alsoup against their own unpleasant reflections
as they lay close together in the dark, wonder-
ing what the whole thing meant, for to neither
had the rascals exposed their identity.

' Hal was not a lad to remain idle in an emer-
gency. His thoughts did not dwell on his own
disagreeable situation, ‘but on the position Vivian

, was placed in. She was under his protection
and it was his duty to ﬂy to her aid if he could
by any means manage it. He struggled desper-
ately to release his*arms. The rascals supposed

, they had bound him securely, but in their hurry
j ” they were not as particular as they might have

.been. ' In a’ few minutes he got one of his arms

’ loose, and the other followed without any trouble.
He tore the gag from across his mouth and threw
it aside. "Pulling out his match-safe which he

always _carried, he struck a li ht and saw‘ where.

his companion lay. He whis ed out his knife
and cut Will free in no time. ‘ - ..
U “Gee! What are we up against?” asked Will.

“Blessed if I know, but we've got to turn the
tables somehow, for Miss King’s sake if not for
ourselves.” V
. “‘We’re in the hold of this hooker. Strike an-
other match‘ andlet us (look around."

Hal did so. ‘There was nothing but a lot of
iron ballast and rubbish to be seen within the
ski‘ ing‘ribs of thepsloop. There was a, narrow
bu khead aft close to the sternpost, and another
forward, much wider, dividing off a small section
"of the hold. The boys made their way to the
latter, and feeling of it, discovered that one of

. the planks had been broken in the center by con-

’ , _ tact with some weighty object. It was not notice-
able except on inspection. Hal put his ‘foot against
the fracture and it yielded in a way that" showed
it could be broken off by suﬂicient pressure.

He looked around among the ballast for a piece
of iron of suﬁicient size to use against it. He
‘founda piece of gas pipe, and uttin the end
of this against the spot in the p ank, oth boys
exerted their muscles, and presently caused the,
board to break off. Pushing the upper half in
so that Will could grasp the lower section, the

;,‘.:.."plank was dislodged after awhile leaving an
opening. Through this Hal ﬂashed a match and
discovered that.the space forward of the bulk-

. head was used as a cook-room .or galley.
V “If we can get in there we can no doubt reach
the deck and put up a stiff ﬁght against those
two rascals,” said Hal.
’ “Then we must get in there,”, said Will; “but
to do that we must dislodge another» board.”
All the other boards appeared to be pretty

 

V «' ‘strong and well secured, but the boys were de- .

. j _termined to overcome the obstacle somehow, and
* " they worked at the bulkhead in various ways but
withoutinuch success. Thus more than an our
assedand darkness was settling down over the
'ace.o‘f nature. The sloop was now. in Newark

-.The~three.younpr people then went to a res- M

late when Hal landed Vivian at her home. ‘Al-
though Mr. Goodman knew she was in Hal’s com¥,

she was out so long. When he heard theirstory 
he was astonishedto ﬁnd they had got into §the’~

«Gabe Case had, in the meanwhile, been brought
to Jersey City.‘ He’ refused to‘ cross the river

voluntarily, so the District Attorney instituted’
extradition proceedings to get him to the Tombs. /

, This would take time, however, and w-hile it was
under way Case was held in the Jersey City“ Jail.
Before the end of theweek Hal sold his M. dz

' H. shares, for a sixpoint advance; making $3,000‘

proﬁt. After theirticklish experience aboard_ the"
sloop, Hal and Vivian were warmer friends than
ever. , .

He showed his- devotion to her in many ways,_

 ' while she gave him every reason to believe that“

she was not indiiferent to his attention.

The old man was perfectly satisﬁed with the-

. ‘way things were going with them, and had ‘lit-
tle doubt that in time Hal would ask him for
.'Vivian’s hand. For a couple of weeks things
went along in a rut with Hal. Then one Satur-
 day morning he recalled the fact that he had

not availed himself of Dick Cunningham's invi-‘

, tation to visit him at his home in" Newtown.
“I guess I’ll go out there this afternoon and
’ call on him,” he thought. “I haven’t anythin
else on'the hooks and I don't believe I coul
put the afternoon in better.”
Accordingly after lunch he crossed over to

Jersey City, and took the trolley car for -New-.

town. When he reached the lake front near
./ Dick's house he saw that the—sloops belonging
to Dick and his chum Archie were not at their
, moorings. That was a sign that the boys were
 ’ off_ somewhere on the lake. ‘However, he called
at the Cunningham residence and asked the gar-'
dener, who was at work on the lawn, where Dick
was. V
“-Gone off sailing,” was the reply.
. “Isuppose he is not likely to be back soon?"
replied the disappointed Hal.
“No, I don’t think he will be.” ‘
, “Well, tell him when he returns that Hal Hal-
man, of New York. came out to see him.”
“I will,” nodded the gardener. ~

Hal started for the trolley car'to return to

New York. After walking a couple of blocks

 ‘ he took a wrong turn, and walking some distance,
he woke up to the fact that he was going in the
wrong direction. Looking around he saw the
spire of a church in the distance which he recog-
nized as belonginq to a house of worshi not far
‘from Main Street. He started towar it. He
», _ soon came to an extensive piece of property cov-
 ered with trees. '
ﬂ He had got half way across it when suddenly

*:'*"- a wicked looking dog dashed out of the shrub-
" fbery and made for him in a menacing way. Hal

 ’ good runner, but could not outrun the dog. The
7_ r only thing, but could not outrun the dog. The

_‘ . into the place where the trunk divided into three
poiiderous branches when the ‘dog was up to him.
He made a ﬁerce spring and snapped his jaws
viciously‘-within an inch of Hal’s right foot, and
‘then ‘fell back on the ground. The minutes‘

is adventure with the ferocious dog on the previ-
pus afternoon in Newtown, and how it led to his
' etting hold of a ﬁrst-class tip which he proposed
a back with his capital of $13,000.

He told‘Mr. Goodman all he had heard Mr..

Sanford tell his friend Dixon about the discov-‘

ry of a great ﬁnd of iron ore in the Iron Moun- -

in mine, and what effect that would have on‘
the stock of the railroad line running between‘
the mine and the 0. & B. road. Mr. Goodman‘

, ,went over the matter with Hal, and at length he‘

was satisﬁed that the boy had hold of a good
lihing.

“I agree with you,'H-al, t at this is a chance
you can’t afford to miss. B you can’t go into

and We will 9:0 into the further details of this
matter in his oﬂice.”

Hal was at the oﬂice next morning at his usual

, time, and entertained Will with the story of the

dog episode, but said nothing about the matter
connected with his tip. When Mr. Glass came
in Hal told him that he wanted a. vacation of
two weeks, as he had some very. important busi-

The members. of _ the swell athletic club left

Tom Cuny’s .face«.Wore a look that was almost A

savage until he happened to look up and see a
handsome, stylishly dressed girl of perhaps six-
teen coming down from the other side of the
grandstand.

She was ‘Lena Bagley, the only daughter of the
wealthy mill-owner.

Cuny lifted his hat and bowed politely, and as

the girl rather coldly acknowledged the salute she .

stepped upon a plank /that had not been nailed.

It tilted with her, and overthe rail at the end of l

the andstand she went, a frightened? screamon
her ips. T

 

M CHAPTER VI.
Sam Has a Fight.

Sam Walters and Pete Perkins happened to be
near the grandstand when they heard a scream.
Sam’s quick eye located Where it came from
instantly. He saw a girl falling over the end

__ of the structure almost above him.

Perkins was so surprised that he stood still in
his tracks. < ’

But not so with Short—stop Sam! .

He bounded forward like a shot and caught
the girl in his arms, breaking her fall and land-
ing her lightly upon her feet.

The mill—owner’s daughter did not faint or go
into hysterics. She was not hurt, she articulated
rather faintly:

hurt. Oh, how can I thank you!”

“Isii’t necessary, miss,” retorted the young
shortstop of the Peerless nine. “Calm yourself,
please.
you.”

By this time a number who had witnessed the‘

accident had crowded around. 
“It’s Short—stop Sam!” shoutedthe small boy
who had worked his way into the enclosure by
climbing the high board fence, and who had as
sisted so much in the rooting for the home, team.
“Gee! You jest oughterseen it, fellers! He
catched dat young -lady jest as easy as ‘he did
dat high ﬂy a little while ago. Short-stop Sam
is a regular hero, an’ .don’t you make no mistake
on dat!” ’ .
Then it was that a wild cheer went up.

There were enough of the spectators who had ‘A

seen the boy save the girl from falling to the

ground to make the welkin ring, and they did it,

with a Will. ,
. Lena Bagley‘ was a rather brave sort of a.
girl. She proved it when she did not go oﬁ into , * »

a swoon, as most girls would have done.

“Thank you, Short-stop Sam,” she said, taking
the boy’s hand and giving it a gentle squeeze. “I
shall never forget you for catching me and saving
me froma bad fall.”

Before’ Sam could make a reply Jack Cuny 

stepped up and took the girl by the arm.

“I will escort you home in my auto, Miss.-.
gB‘agley,” the young man said. “I am so glad you. i
1 are not ' ~ L '

“You saved me from being killed, or badly

-She went away with him,‘ and then our hero
was seized by several of the admiring throng and
carried from the enclosure on their shoulders.

"The rest of the nine followed and the yelling"
‘ and applause was deafening.

:.All this was enough to give a boy a “swelled
head,” as the saying goes, but Sam did not allow
himself to get that way.

V He took it all good-naturedly, and when he was v
ﬁnally placed upon his feet on the ground he

simply said:
“Don’t do that again, fellows.
I like it. I am only an ordinary boy, and have to

. work for a living. If I put up a good game to-day

I am gladgof it. And if I happened to come along

East in time to catch the young lady it was a

for her. Any one would have done

the same t ing had they been there, the same as
I was.” 2 . . ‘ i

“No, they wouldn’tl” declared Pete Perkins.

“I was as near tofher as you were, Sam, and I'll

' _be hanged if I had sense enough to make a inove."

“_The.fellow who laid the planks on the stand

. ought to be punished for not nailing them right,"

said, one of the citizens and backers of the game.
‘«‘I am going to have it investigated.” ‘

The boys got back to their quarters over the ‘
feed store after a while, well satisﬁed with the

result of the game.

Short-stop Sam was the lion of the hour.
Everybody praised him, even to Len Marks, who

had appeared at thelast moment, realizing that ~
it was best for him to act ‘friendly toward the '

boy‘, since his foul scheme had failed.

or, be it known, Marks had bought the bottle
of ‘ginger—ale and doctored it with a nauseous
drug, just for the purpose of rendering the new
short—stop unﬁt to ﬁnish the game. ‘ .

all the young
villain thought of now was to let it drop.

He knew the whole circumstances, and he’

thought it would be best to say something about
it in, order to clearhimself of suspicion.
“Walters,” said he, as he shook our hero by the

A , hand, “I am very sorry that the ginger-ale made

Simms sick. I bought the stuff to give you an
invigorating drink, and if there was anything
wrong about it the manufacturers are respon-
sible for it. I can prove where I bought it and
you saw ‘me open the bottle, you know."

“That’s all right,” answered'Sam. “So long as
nothing serious resulted from it I am satisﬁed.
Simms is about all right, they say, though he suf-
fered w_ith fearful cramps for a while.” ,

Harry Bates looked at Marks ‘rather scornfully
but said nothing, as he took Sam by the arm and

v pul1ed_him away from him.

It was well toward supper time when our hero
had removed his baseball costume and donned his

M . street apparel, so he started homeward with Pete

Perkins, who happened, to live close to the little
cottage Sam’s father had rented.
,.«It was in the part of the town known as the

“working-class quarter that the two boys lived,’

and as they neared the corner where they had to

Pete Perkins shook his fist at the young

THE HOT CORN MAN IS HERE AS HERALD
‘ OF . THE SUMMER

The. hot dog and the chocolate—covered ice
cream bar are suffering a temporarylapse of
popularity on the sidewalks in the neighborhoods
fringing lower First Avenue. Roasted chestnuts
have gone their seasonal way ‘and steaming sweet
potatoes, too, having lost their lure, the sweet
potato man has trundled off his clumsy, high-
stacked cart with its tray of baking roots. The
hot corn man heralds Summer’s approach.

The hot .corn,ven’dor turns off from the busy .

avenue, where fruits and notions mingle on carts
in the gutter and snails bring twenty cents a.
pound in the shell. He passes a. corner where

the atmosphere reeks with vinegar and a bearded ’ if

merchant spears fat cucumbers in a sauerkraut

‘ setting. With an odd little stove, freshly be- ,
smeared with a thirrcoat of aluminum paint and’

its capacity‘ augmented by storage bins made
from old gasoline cans, the hot corn man creates
a small sensation in the side streets. He trudges
along silently, leaving it to his kettle’s aroma to
speak in his stead,’ and by the time he reaches
the middle of the block business is waiting and
dashing after his stove, .
“Hot corn! Oh, gee!” a child on the sidewall:
exclaims, and rushes forward for a coin. Pennies
are extended to the hot corn merchant in as many
grimy hands as he can serve for the moment. He
Ilifts a newly polished, lid and pokes into the
vaporous depths with a bent fork bound to 8
long stick. Out comes a dripping ear, none too
carefully shucked and still entangled in its silk.
It is sufficiently tempting, however, to those who
stand by, judging from the eagerness with which
they crowd around. With something of a ﬂourish

the ear is laid on a board and ﬁrmly grasped,‘

whilea sharp knife divides it into portions. About

an inch of hot corn sells for a penny, with a. free a

hand permitted at the big tin salt—shaker.
One youngster after another takes his bit of

corn, loosely folded in a scrap of paper and puts it \ 

to smacking lips.
Any odd bits left unsold for the moment go into
a pot on the other side of the stove, to be ﬁshed

out when other pennies are proffered _  . H

,« At a. certain period in my professional.career_,
now many» years ago, though I do not propose» to
tellihow many, forifear you will try to reckon
up my‘ age, a subject upon which I am rather
reticent, ‘a. number of mysterious -robberies and
murders occurred. in this city, to the perpetrators

I of which,there appeared _.to be no clew.

, One event in particular set me to thinking, and

I when a man of my business begins to do that he

means something. .
. A,well-known resident of an uptown street was
foundupon his own street in a state of uncon-

—: _sciousness, and robbed of everything valuable
about his person, gold watch and chain,.diamond

‘shirt studs, money, rings andsa locket set with

, pearls and diamonds.

“This latter article was of a peculiar shape, and

_I had ‘the portraits of the owner and his wife in-
side, and was valued far beyond its intrinsic ‘

worth.

The man recovered after several days, during
which the physicians despaired of saving him; but
at last, w'en he was goingso rwellvthat there
was no longer any doubt that he would regain
his health and strength, I visited him to see if
he could recall where he had been on the eve-
ning of the robbery, as. by that means I might
discover some trace of the villains, for I had no
doubt but this was a piece of work done by the

V gang I was looking for.

‘ In the first place, I warned-Mr. Blake—we will

, call him so, although that is not his real name—-

not to sa_ anything to the newspaper reporters,
or, if he id, to give them the impression that he
remembered nothing whatever concerning his do-
ings that evening. '

-I‘ also requested our chief to say to those in-
guisitive busybodies that the police were uttterly

. .' nonplused, and had‘ no clew whatever to the
K V rogues.

.The’ papers abused us roundly for not ﬂ ding
out the scamps at once, but I kept my own c un-
sel, and laughed in my sleeve at the wiseacres
whothought they knew so much more about the
business of detecting criminals than we did our-

I determined to ferret out the densof these
‘sooundrels, and, if possible. get myself enticed
into them, being perfectly conﬁdent that I could
thwart them, once I discovered a clew to their

I identity. A _
' p .»I discovered one quicker than I expected.

,.Knowing that many of the robberies were com-
mitted at large public balls, I got myself up in

I ‘full-dress one evening and attended a‘ high‘-toned
' [affair at the Academy. '

{Here it was that I met Ma’m’selle Berthe, as

” she was called, and took up the end of the thread
..which led me through the labyrinths of criminal

life, and ﬁnally brought me face to face with the
rogues for-‘whom I was searching.

; it happened thus: "‘ '

' She dropped her fan; I picked it up, and trod

 - on her dress, then apologized; a tall, full-bearded
 ‘man. came up, and asked the lady who her com-
 ganion was.

I noticed that the general had many secret
conferences with ﬂashy-looking men in the ba'
parlor, Berthe saying that they ‘were his’ era

I thought I recognized two of these inexorable
creditors as notorious conﬁdence men, but my own

AUSTRIAN LABOR DISPLACED BY
_MACHINES, JOBS INCREASE

In view of the rate at which labor-saving ma-

chinery is displacing workers in the Austrian»

Republic it is considered remarkable in European
labor circles that the little country has been able
to reduce the number of its unemployed drawing
doles’ during the last two years. This is partly
explained by the municipal construction activities
,' of the City of Vienna; these furnish work for

many thousands who otherwise would be idle, and 

at the same time they reduce the housing shortage.

In Austria every application for a permit to
import foreign-made labor-saving machinery duty
= free‘ has . to ‘go through the hands of the
Austrian Engineering Association. ,It keeps rec-
ords of those imports; consequently, it is possible
