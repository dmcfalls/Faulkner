p“Oh, shut up. Don’t talk to me!” growled the other
watchman; and with a shrug?” of his shoulders and\a
short laugh, McGrath slid down a little lower in his
chair until he rested his head comfortably against the
back of it, and then he half—closed his eyes to enjoy
the delicious fragrance of the cigar that had been be-
stowed uponhim. ' i s .

The position of Meeker was such that he could
watch distinctly every move that McGrath might make
while the latter, until he turned his head for the pur-
pose, could not see Meeker at all. i y ' V ,

And so they sat there in silence for aconsiderable
length of time; a silence which was partly ‘trying to

had been before with a surly response. _ M

‘$011’, don’t talk to me,” said Meeker. “Can't you

see that I’m suffering tortures, Mike? It hurts me‘

 every timed I open my mouth to speak.’

 Mc(_}‘rath,shrugged his shoulders a ‘second-time and

black cigar that Had been ‘given him. _ s L

he crossed the room to the window and stood there be-

shoulders projected above it, rendering him perfectly

CHAPTER VII. 
‘THE CONSEQUENCE OF A CLEAN SHAVE.‘-‘pg.

Mike McGrath was plainly disturbed byiythei ques-'
tioning of his.fellow watchman ;,and even Nick Carter,
as he watchedathe man "who, was doing the question-
ing, began to ask himself if after all the plot to rob V
the bank was not deeper than he had dared to guess. ‘

The detective,recalledtvaguely a circumstance not " L
unlike this one which had happened in :the city of "
‘New York many years before, where a plot not un-‘

4

_ like this one had been hatche‘d,by"a gang of robbersl

for the ‘looting of a bankg A W .

M In thaticase, as in this casei—if”what Meeker was . 
contending should‘ be true——-a Watchnianihad’ gbeen‘
impersonated, had reported at the bank Without ;be- ‘
‘ing recognized,’ and a robbery had taken, Vplaceliwhich,
while not like this one, resembled it summarily’ to‘

Nick Carter‘ wentfrom the home of Mrs; Atkerns
straight to the headquarters of police where he spent
a‘1ong time in going over the pictures in the .rogue’s
gallery ;= but, although he madea thorough search he
-could not ﬁnd there at single face which suggested the
original of the bank messenger. »

Once he stopped longienough in-his search" to te1e- I

phone to. his own house, but nothing had been heard

r from‘ Patsy, and so:he continued his labor.

_ When he left the white building in Muibmy Street
he took a Broadway car up—to_wn, and got down from

it at Madison‘ Square; then, as he was about to cross,‘ 

the parkytoward his home he cameface to face with -

Like a ﬂash it occurred to him that doubtless Boyne,
in his character as the count, had carried away with
him a key to that suiteiand had now found it an avail-
able means of escaping from his pursuers.

The detective glanced at the number on the doors

closest tothim, and then moved swiftly along: to the
third one ‘beyond, which was the number he sought.

_ There he paused for an instant,_ and, taking from his
pocket his own pick-lock‘, an instrument quite as eﬁ“ica-
cious as any pass—key~the hotel detective carried, he ap_~

. plied it with great care and caution to the lock,’-s‘o that
. . not even the grating noise of its contact could be heard;

and, having inserted it properly, he gave a sharp. quick’

turn, thus throwing back the bolt of theilock and the
next instant he had leaped inside the room, reaching

the nugget in the place where Joe had kept it and then
turned in ourselves. , ‘
In the morning we got Joe to show us the last place
‘where he had seen his treasure. When his eyes fell upon
the nugget a more astonished man you never saw in your
life. Then to the wondering crowd we told the story of
how we had found it.

Then there was a strange silence, save for an occasional
I rustling of the ivy outside and the whisper of a fine rain as
it felltamidst the leaves clinging about the window-sill.
Click! Click! Click!
Again the soundsbroke the stillness. This time louder
and‘ sharper than‘; before.
Geoffrey Lefroy rubbed his eyes lazily and blinked spas-

modically, in ‘the semidarkiiess. Then again he heard the '

noise. .
‘_ It was unmistakable. Some one was attempting an entry
into. the" dining-room. 7 Silently he slipped on.his bedroom
slippers, then cautiously creeping, _to his bedroom window

of the'ro_om below. i y

C view of the nocturnal visitor. ' ’ ‘

rift of racing clouds. In the ‘light of the moon Lefroy:

kperceiived a.darl< ﬁgure bending over the winclow-sill. For
