Boyd. "

K7»

Bob Howard was just seventeen, and as bright‘
as a new steel trap. Helived with his widowed
mother, sixteen-year-old sister and younger, ~
brother in the top flat of ‘sane of the corner houses ‘
on Eighth Avenue and 1..6th Street. After work-‘
ing two years in Wall Street he had just losthis
position, as he had explained to Mr. Boyd, through "
the failure of the ﬁrm that'had employed him.
Promptly at ten o’cIock next morning Bob entered ‘
the reception-room of Warren Bo_vd’s oﬁice inrtlie 
Barnum Building. To .a clerk who asked his
business, he said he had been told by Mr. Boyd-
the night previous to call at ten o’cloclC '5

"Take a seat, then.” said the clerk. “Mr. Boyd _
hasn’t arrived, yet, but ought to be here any» .
moment.” A , I ‘

So. Bob sat down and waited for the big opera-"
tor to show up. He did not have -long to wait, 7
for Mr. Boyd came in shortly. He recognized his '

and invited him into 
private room. v i

“Glad to see you, young man," he said, genially-'
“I suppose you are prepared to take hold at once ' v
.5Yes, sir," replied Bob promptly ' . . I
' ,“You say you were emllloyed hv Hicks & Harley’:
until that ﬁrm went to-the wall the other day!’?;

“Yes, sir.” ~ ' " ‘

“How long did you worlrfor them?”

“Two years and three months."

And before that?" .  ,

'“I was attending High School; but the sudden?
death of my father compelled me to leave in orders
to “tile sorrgething to help support the family." "g.

. . , .
“I have a recommendation from Mr. Hicks,’
continued the boy, putting his han’d_ into 
jacket pocket. 9 . _  . '
“It isn’t ‘necessary for you to show it,’ Bob--.--* 
I shall call you Bob hereafter-—what you didfior '
me last night is a sufficient recommendation; in
fact, the best you could have. I feel myself 1111

_hint of their import become permaturely known
on the outside it might lead to the_ failure of, ‘or
a large ﬁnancial loss to, interests identified_w1th
my own. I had to call for the immediate resigna-
tion of your predecessor because I had good _rea;
son to suspect that he had yielded to temptation.
‘You need have no fear of me on that account,
sir.” replied Bob, earncstly.

  

‘I think not, for you appear to be of different‘

mold from my late messenger. NOW. Bob. an-
other tliing—-I' hope you have said nothing to
V anybne about last night's affair." ,
‘.1 ’ “Only to my mother and sister, sir.”
“Then see to it that it goes no further I_do

‘~ ' as the man who struck me that cowardly blow,
which might have killed me, is a close relative
 of my wife's—a man who has an office in this

 

 

spectable as anyone in the district._"

"Very‘ well, sir. I shall say nothing about the
matter at all.” ,

“I shall consider it a favor. Bob, and won’t for-
get it Now I will introduce you to my cashier
and head bookkeeper, and then you may take. your
seat in the waiting-room. Your duties will be
somewhat similar to those you were called upon

.- . to perform in your late position.
you will begin with $8.”

Bob was delighted to hear that he was to com-
mence with a dollar more than he had received
from Hicks dz Harley, after two years’ service.
Mr. Boyd was not a member of the Stock Ex-
change, and consequently did not do any busi-
ness direct, but he had a score of brokers at his
heck and call who were always ready to execute
I , .the orders which issued from his oflice. Many
 gwealthy ple, who were seldom seen in the

e I V" Street, did trading through Warren Boyd,-and
' some of his clients were ladies in the inner circle
of the “Four Hundred”—New Yorh’s exclusive
social set. _

Bob had been three days at his new place, which
he liked ﬁrst class, when, havin been dispatched
on an errand to the Mills Building, he met a
friend named Fred Price. who was employed by
Howard Bristow, a lawyer, with an office inx\tlic
 ‘ , Bullion Building, on Wall Street.

“Hello, Bob! -Got another job?” asked Fred,
 olserving the envelope in Howard's hand.
I ‘\ ‘Sure thing,” laughed Mr. Boyd's new messen-
ger. ‘You don’t suppose I can afford to loot
around indeﬁnitely, do you?"

“Well, hardly,” replied his friend.

“Warren Boyd.”

“Is that straight?” asked Price. in some sur-

'se.
“Straight alan arrow}:
' ‘Christopher! You’re in luck."

, ‘I agree with you. It’s a dandv place.”

-» ‘That’: what I've hearda There's hardly a boy

MONEY TO BURN - 3

CHAPTER III.—What]:3:b Banana Peel Brought

Next morning, about eleven o'clock, when Bob
had returned from his second errand, Mr. Boyd
called him into his private room. A small, square
pasteboard box, with the imprint of Benedict
Bros, the jewelers, stood on his desk. .

“Bob,” said the operator, “take a seat a mo-
ment. A few nights ago you saved me from a lot
of trouble, as well as a large monetary loss. I
feel I have not expressed my gratitude in a suf-
ﬁciently substantial manner. I gave you a posi-
tion in my oﬂice, it is true, but that really counts
for nothing, as I had to have a new boy anyhow,
and you’re easily worth every cent I am paying
you. I didn't feel as if I ought to pay you a sum
of money for what you did, for you look like a boy
who would be apt to refuse such a thing as a
monetary compensation, so I am going to sub-
stitute a little present, which I think you will ap-
preciate.”

Mr. Boyd took up the box.

“Permit me, therefore, to present you with this
watch and chaiii as a slight evidence of my ap-
preciation of your kindly action in interfering in
my behalf on the occasion in question.”

The wealthy operator handed Bob the box with
a smile.

He opened it, and saw, resting in a nest of
cotton within, a handsome gold watch and ‘heavy
chain. On the plain, polished case was Bob's
monogram, artistically engraved, while on the in-
side of the back case was the following inscrip-
tion: “From W. B. to R. H. April 16, 190——."

“I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Boyd,”
said Bob, as soon _as he found his tongue. “I did
not expect to receive so handsome and valuable a
present for doing what I can only look upon as
my duty. I shall value it much above its intrinsic
worth, as an evidence of your good opinion, which
I hope always to deserve."

“Well,” laughed the operator, “that was quite a
neat little speech. I have known several distin-
guished men who were unable ‘to express them-
selves as well when taken by surprise by a pres-
entation committee. I am glad you like the watch,
and I hope you will wear it every day, and not
keep it merely as a Sunday ornament.”

“I shall be glad to do so,” replied Bob.

“Very well. That will be all for the present,”
said Mr. Boyd, turning to his desk.

When Bob returned to the waiting-room he
placed the watch in his ve pocket and attached
the chain to the proper bu n-hole. He looked at
the watch half a dozen times that morning to note
the time, though there was a big clock in the
room, and he felt very proud of his new, posses-
A little after twelve o’clock he was sent
to the office. of a certain prominent broker in the
Vanderpoel Building with an important note. The
broker was engaged with a couple of other Stock

Exchange men in his private oﬂlce when Bob ar- .

rived.
“You'll hgve t‘or:ait until Mr. Hale is disen-
gaged, sai a ce “ t."
“I wish you'd tell him I‘heav‘e havery important
note here from Mr. Boyd, to which he wishes an
immediate reply," said Bob.

lavatory, he thought of the sealed and unadilz-esse-l
envelope he had in his pocket. He took it out, and
after feeling of its contents, tore the end off and
‘looked inside. There were several bank bills in
it. .
“My gracious!" he exclaimed. “Why, it’s
money!”
He shook the bills out into his hand and found
there were ﬁve $1,000 notes.
“Gee whiz!” he fairly gasped. “What a find!"

 

CHAPTER IV.—The Kind of a Boy Bob Was.

“Five thousand dollars!" ejaculated Bob, after
examining each bill separately. “Somebody is
_ probably pullin his hair over the loss of this
. money. What 518.“ I do about it? I could keep
it, and nobody be the wiser. I never wanted

_ more than I do at this moment. But then
I'd be as good as a thief, and that’s something
my conscience.wouldn't stand for. But how am I
to ﬁnd the owner? I guess the proper thing for
* . me to do is to speak to Mr. Boyd about it and take
is, _' his advice." ‘

L -’ So Bob, who had not a thought of keeping what
~  not belong to him. if by any possibility the
' ';-*‘‘owner .of the money could be located, went and
knocked at the door of the operator's private
» .,room.

' " e in,” was the rsponse.

Bob entered, and Mr. Boyd regarded him in-

‘ 'ringly. .

? man picked two envelopes up and handed them to
. me after he had helped me up. I didn't notice

~.. that I had two in my hand till I got out of the

_{._’elevator. Then I looked at the second one and
' w it was in a white envelope, sealed and un-

addressed. I felt as if there was something inside

of it. I just opened it, and found ﬁve $1,000
. ,, .

. t"What’s that!" exclaimed the astonished oper-
a or.
“There's the whole business," said Bob, laying
_ the envelope and the ﬁve bills on Mr. Boyd's
*' desk. “Iwant to know whether you think there
is any chance of the owner of that money turning
up to claim it."
- -, The big operator took up the bills and examined
‘them carefully.
‘They appear to be genuine. In fact, there
ian’t much question of that fact. This is the
yuivelope they were in, eh?” ‘
‘Yes. sir."
 Ir. Boyd looked it over as carefully as he had
'-the money. - “
1 ‘There's not the slightest clue to the owner of
 money. ~ You say a paaserby picked it up and
handedit to you, thinking it had been dropped by
with  other envelope?’

— read the note and then turned to Bob. s

 

I

- . g ‘ MONEY T0 BURN 5

“Weren’t you tempted at all to keep this money
and say nothing about it to any one?" asked Mr.
Boyd, watching his new messenger narrowly.

“No, sir. My mother didn't bring me up that
way. She has told me more than once'that no
good comes of dishonesty, and it certainly would
be a dishonest act to retain those bills without
making some efforts to ﬁnd out who they belong
to," said Bob, in such a square, honest way that
Mr. Boyd saw that he was a thoroughly upright
lad at heart, and that knowledge gave him a l'.ill'lll
of satisfaction.

“I am glad to know that you have such excel-
lent principles, Bob," he said, in a friendlier tone
than he had yet assumed toward his new em-
ployee. “You must have a splendid mother.”

“The best in the world!” exclaimed Bob, em-
phatically.

“I can easily see that you appreciate such a '
great blessing. A_ good mother is almost sure to
turn out on the world a good son. Well, you
came to ask my advice about this money, didn't
you?” _

“Yes, sir.” .

“Then I will say that until its owner is found
you have a perfect right to retain it in your pos-
session- It will probably be advertised for-, though
I have no doubt the person who lost it will con-
sider that a sort of forlorn hope. Money is the
easiest thing in the world to negotiate. You
could carry those bills to ﬁve different savings
banks, and each would accept one and open an
account with you. If I had lost that envelooe I

I should consider I had about one chance in a thou-

sand of ever seeing it or the money again. Nine
hundred and ninety-nine people out of :he thou-

sand would argue that it was perfectly honest to

hold on to that money under the circumstances.

At least that seems to be my experience with the

world. Now let us see how we shall try to find the

man who lost that envelope. As you fell in front

of the Morgan Bank, it is impossible the money

might have been dropped by a depositor. If you

wish, I will notify the bank that a sum of money -.
was found by my messenger in the gutter at the 
corner. Of course, I will not mention the amount, ~
neither will I say it was in an evelope. The

owner will have to prove his property in order to

regain it. There are sharpers who would try to V

get hold of this money if thgy had the slightest

clue to work upon. If a depositor, or any one w'h_o_ \,
drew_ this money from the bank, lost it, the ‘
cashier is lll(€l_V to learn of the fact. and‘ in that . .
way we shall get a line on the owner of the bills‘. ~<,‘_
Qtherwise, the only chance of being able to return ’ 5
it will be through an advertisement. If the owner

doesn't advertise, why then you can do so in a <'.'
guarded way. That’s about all that can be said 
on the subject." 7 :1

“I think you had better ut it in your safe and
keep it a while, sir. I on’t care to take the
chance of carrying it around with me," said Bob. .

“Very well; I will do so. I'll write the note to
the Morgan Bank, and you can take it over there
right away and hand it to'the cashier."

Mr. Boyd did so, and Bob, whose head now felt ‘
very much better, carried it over. The cashier

“Then it was you who found the money?"

“That’s right.”

“You are evidently an honest boy.”

__ “You might have kept those bills and said noth-
ing about them. Most boys would have done so.

. I hope your honesty will be suitably rewarded, for
s I can place you in communication with the lady

who lost that envelope. She reported her loss

’ about half an hour ago.”

“It was a lady, then?” said Bob.

. “Yes. I will enclose—her name and address in
a reply to Mr. Boyd.”

‘ oﬂice.
“It was a lady who lost that money, Mr. Boyd,"

said Bob, laying the cashier’s note on his desk.
“How do you know that?”

found them, you say?”

“Yes, ma,’am. If you wish, I will tell you just
how it happened,” replied Bob. .

“I should be glad to learn,” said Mrs. Hubbard,

looks and gentlemanly department. V

Bob then detailed the’ accident which had hap-
pened to him in front of the Morgan Bank, and
how the white envelope containing the money _
came into his possession. '

“You are certainly a very honest boy,” said
Mrs. Hubbard, admiringly, when Bob had ﬁnished
“You might easily have retained that V
mone ." . , ,, _

“I don't think I should have felt particularly 
happy if I had made no effort to ﬁnd the person ' 
who lost it. Five thousand dollars is a "lot of
money, and I could not tell but it might have
proved a very serious loss to the owner.” ;

“Five thousand dollars is, of course, an impor4 .

on having ﬁve kisses. .After supper he gave his

small fortune in consequence. a

CHAPTER VI.——Bob Makes a Good Thing Out
of M. dv. N., and Receives a Shady Proposition.

Although Bob kept a waéchful eye on the ticker
. whenever the opportunity was his, he did not
phrmit his interest in his investment to interfere
in the slightest degree with his duties in the of-
ﬁce. His activity in getting about the district,

' conﬁded to him, commended him more and more
to the attention of Mr. Boyd,,who felt that at last
helhad secured a jewel of a messenger. For
several days there was no noticeable activity in
wll. & N. shares and Bob was beginning to wonder
when the syn ‘cats that proposed’ to boom the
, ‘was going to get busy, when he saw one
‘morning by the market report that some 40,000
shares of the stock had changed hands the day
before, and that the price had advanced to 60.
‘9Well, that looks a bit encouraging," he said to
.-himself. “I ‘guess ‘the pool brokers have com-
rmenced to buy‘ at last." .
, He was kept very busy all that day running er-
‘brands, and did not get a chance to look at the
ticker in the oﬂlce until after the Exchange had
closed for the day. Then he found that M. Jr N.
had been in the active list to the extent of many
. thousand shares, and that it had advanced to 61.
“That looks still better. If I was to close my
deal out at this point, I would be over $500 in

fan: the following morning it dropped back to
5-8. owever, it soon recovered, and closed at
that fternoon. Bob was tickled to death over
His; ghowlng made by his stock, and felt conﬁdent
 would easily double his money.

opened for business, the news passed from mouth
to mouth that the road had gobbled up a com- .
peting line, and, as a consequence, a lot of the
brokers started in to buy the stock. Others fol~
lo\ved their lead, and soon there was a mob of
screaming operators bunched aroundthe M. & N.
standard. The stock suddenly became very scarce,
as those who had shares declined to part with
them when they believed it was bound to go
higher. The result was that the price began to
soar in earnest. The syndicate men gobbled up
every share that was oﬁered, and during the whole
of the ﬁve-hour‘ session M. & N. was the center of
interest. The stock closed that afternoon at 70,
with every prospect of opening next morning at
a higher ﬁgure. Bob felt uncommonly good when
he went home that night, for his shares were
worth $11 apiece more than when he bought them,
or a total of $1,650, out of which the co mission
and interest charges of the bank wo d have to
come. His mother wanted to know what made
him so happy, but he only winked, and told her
he’d let her know all about it in a day or two.

Next morning M. & N. opened at 705-8, and
by noon was hard to get at 75. At that ﬁgure
Bob saw the record on the ticker of 800-shares
sold. The problem which now presented itself to
him was when ought he to sell? He knew well
that it was a dangerous matter to hold on for the
last dollar. Too many experienced, brokers and
speculators slipped up by reaching out for top-
notch prices. As long as there was such a demand - « .
for the shares, Bob thought he was safe enough  '
in holding on a little longer; but still, as the bot- ‘
tom might give way at any moment, he didn’t
feel easy in his mind after the price reached 75.

He was kept so busy at the office that he found
no time to go around to the bank in Nassau street, A
and so the Exchange closed with the stock at
80 7-8. The bank wouldn't act on a telephone
message, for how could the clerk who received
such a message know the identity of the person ’
who sent it? As_he had not left a copy ,of his ' H‘:-4
signature there either, a written message would’ ' .
also be worthless. The bank, however, kept open
till four o’clock for the accommodation of those
having stock transactions on hand, but no de-
positor could draw or put money in after-‘three. ~

At a quarter to four Bob was released for the _
day, and he took advantage of the fact to stop at
the bank, see the margin .clerk, and order his
shares sold at the opening price in the morning. - ‘

He was somewhat nervous that night lest some-
thing nught crop up that would cause a slump
when the Exchange opened at ten o'clock next
day. However, nothing happened, and M. Q N.
began business at 81%, at which ﬁgure his
150 shares were disposed of. The stock cop-
tinned to advance during the day, and when Bob
saw it was up to 86, he was sorry he hadn't held
on awhile longer. " ~ /

“Well,” he reﬂected, “a bird in the «hand is
worth in the bush. I know where I'm at. X, i
know that I have made over $3,000. and that the’ K
money IS as good as if it was in my pocket. I
won't have_§o worry any more about a slump;
which is bound to,come sooner or later.” .  ** ’

Next morning he received a statement of new
count and a check for something over,$4.J.@ '

up-as a margin. Bob looked long and lovingly at
tiult check. -

( ‘Just to think that ten days ago I wasn't ‘worth
;.~. a cent, and now I am quite\a little capitalist.
‘" This is a fine beginning. If I can only do as well
next time, I'll soon be on my way to wealth."

When he went to lunch he took the check to the

Nassau street bank and asked the cashier to izive
him a certiﬁcate of deposit for the 84,000, and the
i, ' -balance in cash. He was accommodated.

“Now I'll give mother another ﬁfty, sis twenty-
ﬁve, and I'll buy a new suit and a few other things
I need for myself,” he said to himself, as he
walked back to the oﬂice. ~

As he was about to run up the stairs for he
seldom bothered with the elevator just '‘for the
' one-story ride, he felt a touch on his shoulder.
3‘. He turned and confronted a well-dressed boy of
his own ageywhom he did not remember ever
having seen before. ,

“You're Bob Howard; aren't you?" he asked the

 

 
 

 

‘Yes, that's my name.”
“Boyd's new messenger, eh?"
“Yes.”
“Do you know who I am?"
‘I do not.”
“My name is Oscar Lovett."
“Oh! You used to work for
“Warren Boyd," interrupted the youth, with a
grin. “Exactly. You've got my place. How do
you like it. so far?”
l‘"I‘1p,top.'_' "
“It's all right. I left because I could do better.
Bob didn't believe that, because he had heard
from Mr. Boyd's own lips that he had discharged
his late messenger for cause. However, he didn't
give expression to his thoughts. He simply waited
to ﬁnd out what Oscar Lovett wanted with him.
. “I've been trying to see you for several days,"
‘said Lovett, assuming a confidential and friendly
manner. _
“What for?" asked Bob, curiously. _
“I want to put you on to the good things you’re
’ next to," with a wink.
“I don't quite understand what you mean."
“Come out on the sidewalk, and I'll put you
wise to a thing or two.”
~ _. ‘ Bob’s curiosity induced_ him, to follow Lovett
 outside. v _ ‘
“Now see here, Howard, you look like a clever
chap, who would be willing to take a vantage of
' any chance that would put an hone t dollar in

would soon have reported to Mr. B. what I was
doing, and then my name would have been Tom
Flynn—that is, I would have got the G. B.”

“That is just what you did get," thought Bob,
but, of course, he didn't say so.

He was anxious to hear all that Lovett had to
say.

“I made cautious inquiries here and there
among ﬂy lads. and after a while I got next to a
man who was in the market for good tips, and was
willing to treat the fellow white that produced "A

can't get hold of any more good things in that

I did, and the tips are bound to come your way if

how to use it to advantage, for, of course, you
haven't any capital. Well, I can intrmzuce you to

“I don't think it is a fair thing to sell a tip

ing Lovett in the eye. “It's too much like skin-
ning the boss."

“Ho! It wouldn't hurt Boyd any, while it would
put a hundred or more dollars in your clothes.

my pocket as well."

Oscar Lovett winked knowingly.

“Six months from now, when you have a good-
sized wad in your pocket, you'll say I'm your best
friend," he continued with a cheerful grin. “I'll
meet you again in a day or two, and if you're the
chap I think you are, we'll go around to the man
I_spoke about, and I'll give you a knock down to
him. After that it will all be clear sailing for
you. _Whenever you get hold of something you

worth his while, he'll make you a good offer, and
when you get the money all you'll have to 'do is to
senézlh me half and keep the rest. You'll have a

Bob was so indignant with Lovett for making

' this proposition that he felt like kicking him into

the gutter. On second thoughts, he concluded not
to have s run-in with him just then, but to let
him think he meant to consider the matter. He
gave Lovett a hint to that elfect, and Oscar went

off with a smile of satisfaction on his cou4ite- ,,

Mr. Boyd smiled and said he _would_ like to ﬁnd

Bob, which was that if he saw Oscar again and
the subject was brought up. that Bob would agree
‘ with Lovett’s proposition and endeavor to ‘get in
touch with the man higher up. after which he

‘I wonder if the man he's going to introduce
me to is Lawyer Bristow, Fred's boss, and Mr.
Boyd’s brother-lb-law?” thought Bob as he con-
tinued on his way. .

When Bob returned to the oﬂice he told Mr.

that he had met Oscar Lovett ,and that
Lovett was going to introduce him that afternoon
to the man who bought tips from messenger boys.

“All right.” replied the operator. “I’ll provide
you with a tip to sell him in a few days." _

He smiled grimly, and Bob _concluded that it
was likely to prove an expensive pointer to the

urchaser. At a uarter to four Bob met Oscar
vett in the vestibule of the Bullion Building,
and the two boys took the elevator up to the
eighth ﬂoor. Lovett led the way along the corridor
till he came to Bristow’s oﬂice. .He opened the
door, walked in, and Bob followed, Fred Price
opened his eyes very wide when he saw Howard,
and was about to address him when Oscar told
him to tell Mr. Bristow that he was waiting to see
him; Presently Fred returned, and szﬁd Mi‘.
Bristow would see him. '

‘Come on,” said Lovett to Bob, and they entered
the inner oﬂice while Fred gaped in wonder.

“Mr. Bristow, this is Bob Howard, Mr. Boyd’s

. new‘ messenger," introduced Lovett.

-- _ The lawyer looked u , and Bob ‘started with

" surprise. He recognize Mr. Bristow as the per-
aoawho had felled Mr. Boyd to the sidewalk with

:3,’ the slungshot that night on Seventh avenue, and

iii‘ ,whom he had struck. in the jaw. causing him to

 drop the paper he had been after. Mr. Bristow,

' however, did not seem to recognize him, though
he had an indistinct impression that he had seen
the boy before.

‘Pleased to know you, Howard," replied the
lawyer, with a bland smile. ‘ -

Bob saw that Fred’s description of his boss had
not been magniﬁed. He was certainly dressed in
swell garments that ﬁtted his ﬁne form to a nice-
ty. His four-in-hand ties were marvelous crea-
tions. A heavy gold watch chain crossed his vest

 from pocket to pocket, meeting in a button hole,
~ ‘ and a splendid solitaire diamond glittered on the
. little ﬁnger of his right hand.

‘So you are Warren Boyd's new messenger,
 eh?" he said, after Bob had acknowledged the in-
."  tT0dnC'ﬁ0n. I
ff -- “Yes, sir.”

. ' “Well, any time yo|_i get hold of inside informa-
“- tion about some stock operation that is under way,
, and you want to raise some money on the tip,
‘ bring it around to me. If I think well of it, I'll

pigeon-hole in his desk and handed ‘it to Lovett.
He read it over.

“That's all right. Just sign this, Howard, so
I'll know where I stand." ’

Bob read it over. It was an agreement binding
him to pay Oscar one-half of what he received
for his first tip and one-third of what he got for
each and every subsequent pointer. Bob signed
it, and Lovett put the paper in his pocket with a
smile of satisfaction. That concluded the busi-
ness, and then Bob and Oscar left the oﬂice to-
gether, not even noticing his friend Price, much
to the latter’s astonishment.

CHAPTER VIII.—-Bob's Run of Luck.
Lovett left Bob at the subway station at the

corner of Wall Street and Broadwav and took a _

street car uptowm Bob didn't take a subway
train, but returned by a round-about way to the
oﬁice, where Mr. Boyd wm waiting to see him.

“Well, who is the man, Bob?” asked the big
operator.

.“He’s a lawyer, and his_name is Bristow," re-
pllellld thekboy‘, \\‘8l’.Cl’1l;ng his boss to see how he
won a e t e reve tion.

“Bristow, eh?” replied _Mr. Boyd, slowly, ap-
parently’ not greatly surprised. "What did he say

0 you .

_Bob gave him the substance of the brief inter-
view. Mr. Boyd was silent for a moment or two
after Bob had ﬁnished.

“All right, Bob,” he said, at length; “that will '

be all."

'_l‘hree weeks passed away, and Mr. Boyd never
said another word to his messenger about the
man who bought tips.

:‘I guess, as Mr. Bristow is his brother-in-law,
he s dropped_the matter altogether,” thought 

The first time he met Fred Price after his visit
at the lawyer's oﬁice, Fred was exceedingly curi-
ous to know how he came to know Oscar Lovett.
and what had brought him up to see Mr. B1-istow,
Bob, however, passed the matter of in an oﬂhand
way, and Fred did not suspect the true reason of

the visit. Twice during the three weeks Lovett-

met him and wanted to know how it was that he
was ’so slow getting hold of a tip.

I in slay because things are closer than wax in
the °ﬁl°°v 1'°Pl1&d Bob. “I haven't been able to

“You don’t listen hard enough.” replied Oscar.’

“Aren't you workip yet?’

_ “No. What's the use . I get my board and ind“-
_mg free. and I manage to pick up a few dollars
one way or another. Just now I'm expecting you
to give me a lift.”

“Well, there's nothing doing yet," replied Bob,
entering the nearest building for the purpose of
giving him the shake. '

_ It was about this time that Bob saw a predic-
tion in a ﬁnancial paper that Lgrtain mining:

stock, largely dealt in on the Broad Street curb, _ i

would reach 15 in two weeks. As the stock was
then selling strong at 29, the Young. messenge:

  

   
   
   
   
   
   
  
  
   
   
    
   
    
 
   
    
 
   
  

could not quite understand why such'a big break

— _ was likely to take place. That afternoon he
[showed the cli ping to Mr. Boyd, and asked him

he thought here wasuany likelihood of such a

’ thing taking place, _

. “Why do you want to know, Bob?” ‘asked his

employer, with a shrewdsmile. _ _ .

; "Because if I thoughfthere was anything ‘in it,
' Pd like to sell a few shares short and make a
stake.” . '

 “So you’re getting interested in the market, are
I - 031?” ’ .:
' , "‘I can’t help getting interested in a good
réwhen I see one in sight.”

- “Well, Bob, Wall Street men do not care to en-

house with plenty of ground in the suburbs of
New York, and take life in a sensible and cheer-
ful way. Bob had the money that made this
dream of their life possible, and now Nellie and
her mother made frequent trips to upper New
York, and to Long Island, on a still hunt for the
home they had in their mind's eye. Finally they
found several places that met their views, and
after Bob had looked at them, one was picked out,
and Bob handed his mother $15,000 to buy and
furnish it to suit their taste.

He then gave his mother $10,000 cash to place
to her credit in a downtown trust company subject
to her check. That left him with $150,000 to
ﬁnance any stock deal he had a mind to. Al-
though Bob might now be considered a capitalist,
no one outside of his own family and the 91‘ ‘in! ant
and cashier of the little bank in Nassau Street,
who regarded the bright boy as a wonder, was
aware of the fact. Bob believed that a still
tongue makes a wise head, and he made it a point
to keep his business to himself. Two days after
Bob_had been interviewed by Oscar Lovett he
carried a message from Mr. Boyd to the oﬂice of
Gans & Co., in the Mills Building.

The message was addressed to Mr. Gans per-
sonally, but that gentleman was so busy that he
could not be disturbed, and Bob had to wait. He

picked up a newspaper and started to read the .

details of a noted murder trial going on in an‘
upstate town. He did not at once notice that a
couple of men, who proved to be brokers, had
entered the room and were conversing if a low
tone near him. They were waiting to see Mr.
Gans,‘and did not particularly notice the boy. who
seemed to be absorbed in the morning paper.
Pretty soon Bob woke_ upto the fact that a very
interesting subject was being discussed at his
elbow-. The two brokers were talking about the
consolidation of two western roads that had long
been rivals in south-western business out of India-
napolis. Bob had seen minors of a projected join-
inggof the interests of the two roads in the news-'
papers for the past two months, but nothing deli:
nite had come to light.

One of the brokers assured the other that the
consolidation was an established fact, and would
be announced in a day or two, and that the veri-
ﬁcation of the'fact was sure to cause I. & W.
stock to boom at once. _

“I've bought as many shares as I can handle
at 90, and I advise you to do the same,” he said
to his friend.

Bob made a mental note of all the facts, and
presently the office boycame up and told him

to the oﬂice he started to consider the chances of
making a good thing out of what seemed to be
a ﬁrst~class -tip. It looked all right, and he de-
cided that he would get right in on the ground

After his return 1

Accordingly, he asked permission to go oil‘ for

customers. . .

to swingthe deal, and Bob put up ten per cent,
of that amount as security on the shares. Inside
operators had been -loading up with the stock for
several days back, consequently it was rather
hard to get-hold of. It fact, it took the bank two
days to put the deal through, but they ﬁnally got
the stock through their regular brokers, and _as
fast as they got it they deposited it as security
with other banks in order to raise the funds nec-
- cessary to make good their purchases.

The day after Bob was notiﬁed that the shares
had been secured the news of the consolidation of
the two roads came out, and then there was a
rush to purchase I. & W. by a crowd of brokers
who wanted to get a slice of the melon about to. be
cut. The rush to buy sent the stock booming, and
its extreme scarceness caused the price to Jump
a point at a time, so that it reached par and
passed it, closing the first day at 105. On the
following day the scramble for the stock was

a worse than ever, and when the chairman’s mallet
" closed business at the Exchange at three o'clock
it was bid at 115, with the ﬂoor in a turmoil.

Notwithstanding the fact that Bob was fairly
coining money, having run up a paper proﬁt in
three days of‘ $325,000, the boy didn’t lose his
head, but went about his daily routine of duty in
Mr. Boyd's oﬂice as though I. & W. had not the
least interest for him. On the next day Bob began
to notice an 'unusual number of ysales on the
ticker at prices from 116 to 118. _ —

“I’ll bet the insiders are unloading to take the
‘mine ‘ proﬁts that are within their grasp.
That’:$i‘nt" enough for me to get out from‘un_der
too, for no one can, tell when a break in the price
in come now.”

7 ~ he got ermission to leave the- office once
more, and be 0st no time in getting to the bank
"and ordering a sale of his, holdings. The stock
was sold in small lots, and inside of twenty“min-
utes he didn't have a share left, the whole going
at an average price of 118. His statement next
morning showed that he had made $415,000 on
the deal. ’

“Gee! I've got money to burn now!" he ex-

claimed, as he looked at his check, “for I'm worth

While Bob was piling up his proﬁts, another

way. The _lawyer was so sure that he had a

a small army of Mr. Boyd’s brokers. The result
was it went down at such a rate that the lawyer
was fairly bewildered.

He failed to respond for additional margin. and
was wiped out. Somehow or another he heard
several days afterward that the whole thing (as.
a bit of stock Jobbing, to do somebody up. and
he thgn began to suspect that he was the victim.
especially as Bob did not show up to ask for his . '.
ten per cent.

He was the maddest man in Wall Street after
he_ had reasoned the matter out, and he swore
to be revenged on Warren Boyd. When Oscar
Lovett dropped in to ﬁnd out how Bob's pointer
was panning out. Mr. Bristow went for his scalp
in a way that made his head swim.

“ “That was a fake tip!” he roared ~at Oscar.

The whole thing was a~put up job on Boyd’:

Lovett was thunderstruck, and had nothing to ‘
say. .

“But I'm going to get square with Mr. Boyd,’
snapped the lawyer. “and I shall probably re-
quire your assistance.”

“I’m with you if you mean to include Bob .
Howard in the scheme,” replied ‘Oscar. vindie~ "*
t1'VelY. for he had counted on replenishing his .-
ﬂat pocketbook out of the proceeds of the tip 
which had gone wrong. and he hated Bob, ac.
cordingly. ‘

“He _shall certainly_be made to pay for his
share in the transaction,” replied Mr, Briseow,
“Come here this afternoon after four. I may
want to see You about the matter."

Lovett agreed to be on hand, and went away
with no verv charitable feelings in his heart for 7'3-
Bob. Mr._ Bristo_w soon afterward sent a iiies— A

man who had been associated with him that

Spicer. and then _the two put their heads to
gether with the view of getting back at Wu-mg
Boyd. Subsequently Oscar Lovett was admitted
to the conference. He was valuable in a, way,’
because he was acquainted with Mr. Boyd's omgg
methods. and many of the details of his business.

Oscar told Mr. Bristow that twice a yea:-_..og _ i

went through the building and rang up a time

They had provided -themselves with heavy
beards as.a disguise, and meant to make their
exit when they had ascertained that the man
was on an upper ﬂoor. While watching Mr.
Boyd and the boy at their work. it struck Spicer
that it would simplify their work greatly if they ’
could get possession of the securities before they
were placed in the steel box for the night. 4
So he set his ready wits to work to think out» i
some plan by which this might be accomplished. ,.
He whispered the matter over‘ with Mr. Bristow,
but nothing feasible seemed to present itself to
their minds. It was at this point that Mr. Boyd
cut the last coupon, which Bob added to its p_ar- i
tzhcular bunch and placed a rubber band around r
em. ‘ .~
“Does everything tally, Bob?" asked the oper-
ator. , \ «
“Yes. sir." i -
“Very well." - '_
Mr. Boyd opened his private‘ safe, placed the :
bunches of coupons in an inner receptable, and y ‘
locked it again. ’ «'9
“Now, Bob. put the securities in that chest,” b
said the capitalist. “I'm going‘ to wash my hands. - “‘
Then we’ll make a start for home." ’ =‘
‘All right. sir," replied the boy. zetting busy. ‘
Mr. Boyd passed through the counting-room
to the lavatory. ~.-
“Here's our chance." whispered Spicer. “We’ll . . i
put our beards on and catch Boyd by surprise in ' 5
the washroom. Then we’ll come back, do up the
boy, take the securities. and vamoose the ranch.’ . v
» . This hastily conceived plan was agreed upon, ,; 5»
and they started to execute it. ‘_. , " “'
“YOU Stay here, Oscar," said Bristow. “‘If‘
there is any noise ‘in the washroom that attmcui‘
Howard's noticeﬁwhy you can head him oﬂ’ if‘
he attempts to investigate." ~
_The lawyer and» his friend Spices then" cau-

moments Lovett heard a scuffle and a muﬂid

cry. ..
l_ tBob heard the sounds, too. and he stopped to "

“I wonder what that was?" he asked himself}: - -_ ~
“I guess I’ll go back and Ba." * '.
He started for the counting-room, Osar saw
him coming. and looked around for somethin
to attack him with. The only thing handy was
an oblomr book, called a blotter—not a vary for-
midable weapoh. but still ‘one which would have is
considerable effect if brought down on a pa-
son’s head with considerable force. _ 
Oscar grabbed the book. and as Bob passed‘  \

and Lovett Jeaped _upon him. The young mes.

He then started for the lavatory. When he

great many of the passengers intended to get
oil‘ at the latter place and go to the grounds
of the Military Academy, and Bob and Fred were
among the number. _
Oscar Lovett was also on the boat, in corn-

- pany with John Spicer. but neither Howard nor

Price saw him. though Oscar had seen em.
When Bob and Fred followed the crowd as are
at the West Point landing, Oscar and Spicer were
not’ far behind them. After spending an hour
or more in the neighborhood of the summer camp
of the embryo officers of Uncle Sam, Bob and
Fred wandered all’ around the neighborhood.

to be all alone by themselves on a lonesome
stretch of the high land. Below Them the water
laved upon the black rocks and flowed into nar-

formed in haphazard fashion. Near one of these
ﬁssures stood a tall. unirainlv-looking tree, which
seemed to be only half alive, for the lightning
had. upon some forgotten occasion. blazed a white-
and raztted trail upon one side of it. At the
foot of this tree lay a _louz_eoil of rope. '

Bob. as he looked at the line.

“Search me.” replied Fred. “Somebody must
have forgotten it."

looked down into the narrow crevice, which was
punctured with rocks and stunted shrubbery that
grew straight out from the rugged walls.

“Well. if you won't go I will. l’ll just do it

I-Ie let himself down over the edge, and using
the tautened rope to steady and sustain himself,
he made his way down into the ﬁssure, from
projection to projection. until at last he stepped
from the ledge where the pocketbook lay.-when

CHAPTER XIV.--Conclusion.

Althouzh Bob was worth one million two hun-
dred thousand dollars in actual money. he ‘did
not think of resigning his humble position as
messenzer to the capitalist. His salary had 
advanced to ten dollars, and Mr. Boyd treated
him with the greatest consideration. He had
made arrangements with the bank in Nassau
Street to loan out on call a portion of his money.
while the balance was distributed among several
trust companions on special deposit. As a re-
sult the boy was making a large income out of
his capital.

He picked up a couple of v uable tips in his
office during the next few mo ths. but he made
no attempts to use them, as he considered he

ﬁes in honor  not to do so. It was along
ward Thanksgiving that the newspapers began

to report the formation of a clique to net con-
trol of the traction corporation of which Mr.
Boyd was president and his friends the directors.
It was a scheme that required millions, but the
opposition seemed to have all the money it needed.
The members of the syndicate had been quietly
buying up the stocks for months. until Mr. Boyd

woke up at last to the fact that the situation was .

critical. He discovered. as the time drew near
when the annual meeting would be held. that

several persons whom he counted upon had gone-

over to the enemy, and that others were waveririg
on account of the large price they were otfe
for their holdings.

It was absolutely necessary for Mr. Boyd and
those closely allied with him in the company
that they should be able to hold the waverers in
line or buy out their stock at the-same ﬁgure.
which was above the market. offered by the com .
bination that was ﬁghting to wrest the control of
the traction roads away from them. A large
Dart of Mr. hoyd's money was invested in other
corporations as well as the traction company’:
h0l<lln8S_» and so he could not bring all of his
capital into the light. The same was also true
of the other directors of the company. Conse-
quently Mr. Boyd and his friends had to borrow
on such approved securities as they could pro-
duce in order to meet Hue unusual drain on
their resources.

Bob Howard knew in a general way how things
stood, for he kept track of the matter in the
99968. _and he heard a great deal that trans-
mred right in the oﬂicc. He knew the day
bef°re the annual meeting that the question or

_th_e control of his boss's traction interests was
still a matter of grave doubt. He could easily
See that Mr. Boyd was very much worried over
the situation. On the morning of the day in
question several gentlemen called -to see Mr.
Boyd. and he showed them into the private oﬂee,
where a conference of at least an hour was held.

When the gentlemen came out of the inner room ' 7

‘I don’t know what I shall do. These people

been offered by the brokers of the opposition. I-
have until three o’clock to take them up. but
I don’t see how I can do it. as I can’t raise
on such short notice within a million of the total
sum, and they insist on‘ spot cash. If Sage,
Barlow & Cummings get this stock it will settle
the ﬁght in favor of the syndicate. They will

“It  too bad, Boyd,” replied his friend. sym-

 “I am going the rounds now for that purpose,

. Mr. Boyd looked. at his messenger as if he
thought he had suddenly zone crazy. .Then Bob
 started in to explain how he had actually made

Mr." Boyd got the millionhe wanted and~bought
the ﬁve thousand shares that‘ turned the tide _
of the traction ﬁght in his favor. He paid 210
for them, though the highest market quotation
was 205. They became Bob’s property absolutely
on the following day at 200,\ Mr. Boyd refusing‘
to accept the other twenty-ﬁve thousand dollars ,
from him on the ground that thel accommoda-
tion of loaning the million was worth that to
him. That afternoon Mr. Boyd and his associates .7
were re-elected on the board of the Northern. 
Traction, and he was also re-elected president for  -2 I
another year. ' 7'

The new year was hardly a week old when Mr. ’ ~'
Boyd was notiﬁed that a man named John Spicer 4
had been arrested in San Francisco for trying to , "1
sell some of the securitiesthat had been stolen; '
from him on the night of June 30 of the previous 47
year. Extradition papers were secured and Mr.-.-. =
Spicer was brought back to New York. When  
lodged in the Tombs he sent for Mr. Boyd. The‘ ,
capitalist refused to visit him until a second .~
note from the prisoner gave him to understand‘ ;:i
that if the matter was not compromised he would _
squeal on a certain party who was the principal ; 
in the case. -’ ’ A

Mr. Boyd knew that Spicer referred to Andrew 
Bristow, and so he called upon him to see what
he had to say. Spicer said that all the  ,-
bonds would be returned if the case was dropped. ;
Otherwise he‘would offer to turn State's evidence 
asrainst the lawyer. The capitalist tookthe mat-  .
ter under consideration and visited his brother-‘
in-law at his oﬁlce. What passed between them
was known only to themselves, but an arranges 
ment was made by which the case was pigeon-‘_- .
holed and Spicer was let out on bail. _;  ll

And Bob never learned the cause of the assault '
made upon Boyd by Bristow when the boy first ,.
made the broker's acquaintance. Oscar Lovett" A
escaped the proiriised vengeance of Bob Howard, 
for the West Point affair, and soon. afterprthat‘ 
incident he got hnother position in Wall Street. ~ ,
Shortly after Spicer was let out of the Tombs;
Oscar was arrested for abstracting a bond‘1rom' ‘
the safe where he was employed. and he was put \ ._
in the very cell vacated by Spicer. He was coin-..
victed of the charge and sent to_the Elmira Re-,-‘ --
formatory for three years, where he.still is, with ;-.9
a few months to serve. -‘ ' ‘ V 

As for Bob, he cast his first vote at the last 
November election. He now occupies a resp<m—‘ 3‘
sible position in Mr. Warren Boyd's oﬂice. and 
is that gentleman's most trusted employee. Ha ‘;
is also assistant secretary of the Northern Trac-

iori Company, the stock of which is now wortli‘~
290, or nearly half a million more than he gave”
for it. It pays him a dividend every three months‘ —
of 1 1-4 per cent... and that is quite an item air -‘

ARBALESTRIERS WERE POPULAR

The arbalest was one of the first machine guns
knoxm to warfare. It was a crossbow which was
so strong that artiﬁcial means had to be adopted
to draw back the cord. It shot a short. wicked
auanel, or arrow. Prior to the Fourteenth Cen-
tury all European armies had troops of arbales-
triers. fI'he,v.. were formed into confraternities.
used at guard duty in times of peace, and were
given many privileges by way of encouraging
them to greater skill. The Genoese even had
arablestriers for hire; at Crecy the French em-
ployed 6,000 of these mercenaries. The Gas-
cons and the men of Brabant were noted for. their
skill with the bow. and many towns of northern
France maintained their own companies of ar-
balestriers, who were called to occasional service
under the powerful dukes when a quarrel was to
be settled. Froissart records an occasion when
an English king borrowed the French arbales-
triers for use in a war in which France was not
concerned. and it is on record also that a com-'
nany of English longbowmen served in the French
forces of Richelieu at the siege of La Rochelle.

(A Serial Story.)

CHAPTER  ( Continued“ .

Brown was gone a long time. Meanwhile Rob
was permitted to roam about the camp and had a
ﬁne opportunity to see everything. By the time
Brown joined him he felt that he had material
for several splendid stories for the Earth, but it
was necessary to trust to memory. He did not
dare to take notes.

Brown took him to the tent. _
that he was excited about something.

"Look here," he whispered, “the general was
intending to send Captain Steinmeyer to Luxem-
burg on a secret mission. There are more papers
coming from Berlin. He wants _me to go and
fetch them and at the same time pick up such in-
formation as Ican. I have accepted the commis-
sion. Want to go along?" T
‘ Robthought of Edith. . _

It seaned like utterly deserting the poor girl.

‘How do we go?" he asked. “Won’t I be
spotted as English at once?" ,

~ “Not when we get through with you. Of course
there must be no ‘English talk except when we
absolutely know we are alone. You will pose as
jay deaf and dumb servant-—see?”

“How are we to pass through the German
lines ‘."' _ _

“We shall pass over them, boy. Totten lS.t0
drop us near the place in his aeroplane and pick
as up again later."

. “I hardly know what to say.” I
._ “Of course it is terribly risky business."
“We‘shall be shot as spies. Think well before
. you decide.” .
. ‘ Rob stood pondering. ‘
I’ "I'll take a chance,” he said at length.
- “Good! I shall be glad of your company. No
time to be lost. Come with me."
They looked up the lieutenant in his tent.
“He'll go." said‘ Brown; “it's all arranged.”

‘  “Glad of it. Oh. Meyers!” called the airman.

 A soldier stepped out of an inner compart-
" lﬁent. ' ~ ‘I
_ “llo your work.” ordered Totten. and he added:
=:“Meyei's is an expert theatrical make-up man.
‘ Ee’l1 turn you into Deutchers in short order. He
, attends. to all the spies." ‘ ,
T The word grated on Rob. He half regretted his,
‘sien, but it was too late to back out now.

Itis, ‘but to have every facility at hand for car-

sling. He wore the uniform of a German soldier
and bore every appearance of having seen hard
service.

Rob, on the other hand, was dressed as a man
servant and his face was so changed that any one
would have pronounced him German. A ﬂaxen-
haired wig completed the illusion.

They were then taken to General Taylor's tent.

“That's all right." he said. “You'll pass mus-
ter. Here are your papers, Brown. Don't for-.
get now, you are Sergeant Stein of the 86th,‘
bound home on a furlough on account of your
wound. Make up any old story you please to ac-
count for Randall. Remember, Randall, youam? 5‘
to be deaf and dum ." "

“I’m not likely to forget it, sir," replied Rob. ,
“I’ve no desire to be shot.” ’

Brown had already received his instructions
and within half an’hour the start was made.

The day was ideal for ﬂying. A
The aeroplane rose like a bird and went soar-
ing over the German army at what seemed to -
Rob an enormous height. . ;‘

“Now, Ro ,” said Brown, after they were well A
up, “I told_ you we were going‘ to Luzemburgg.’
and -so we are-going over it. That is not our real. 2
destination. I have yet to learn it myself. Lieu- Q

“Oh, yes." was the reply. “I have down all?

had a lot of airmen in training. So did France

HISTORY OF SALMON

The history of the salmon begins with a pink
egg the size of a garden pea. In a little over
two months, writes William L. Finley in The
Natwre Magazine, the egg reaches the eyed stage;
that is, two little eyes begin to show through the
transparent shell.

In about three months the baby ﬁsh strug-
gles till he cracks open the shell and emerges,
somewhat as a chick hatches from a hen’s egg.

When the new—bom salmon comes out of the ’ .
shell he looks as if he were all eyes. He has a 4 1
very slender tail. On the under side of the main
part of his body is the yolk sac, which furnishes - , .
him food for a full month or more. He is -an or- 
phan. without mother or father, so from the time i
he struggles up out of the sand he paddles his
own canoe in his world of water weighted clown ,
with the weight of his yolk sac for the first ;: i
month he lies close to the bottom under and be- ,"_,
tween protecting rocks. ’ ’ '

Then, when the lunch he started with is ab-
sorbed, he is more active, buoyant and can swim - 1 .
up. ‘He learns to rise to the surface and snap; 

He develops very slowly day by‘ V "
‘day; his nose always points upstream, but he 
gradually comes under the inﬂuence of the swift ‘g
waters. He learns to keep in the-shallower places a

away from the bigger ﬁsh that may ‘snap him '
u

up ﬁrom the sea to the mountain waters where .
he was born‘ takes possession of him and urges .‘ 4
him on to a life in the sea., It may be nearly .~ ‘
a year and he may be from three to six inches
in length before-he tastes salt water.

As birds of a weather ﬂock together, so the
little salmon collect in schools, swim out of the
river into the nown depths of the ocean. The ~
feedinggro of the schools of salmon are 
likely within a radius of from ten to twenty ‘ ""
miles from the mouth of the arenr stream,
where they are always within the inﬂuence oftho
fresh coastal waters. ‘ ‘ V _‘

MATCHES AWAY FROM THE
CHARGING BATTERY

It is not generally known, unfortunately, that

a storage battery on charge is giving off hydro-
gen gas, and that this gas, when mixed with the
oxygen of the air, forms an explosive. For this
reason one should keep one’s face and lighted
matches away from the vent of a battery while
it is on charge. The small vent of the battery is
auﬂicient to permit the escape of the hydrogen
gas, under normal conditions. In the presence
of a ﬂame, however, the hydrogen gas, mixed with
gen, may ignite and the battery may very
well be blown to pieces. One should use an elec-
tric ﬂashlight in looking into the charging bat-
tery to see the level of the electrolyte in each cell.

WHAT RESISTANCE FOR THE RHEOSTAT?

One of the several questions which arise in the
construction of a home-made receiver is the re-
sistance of the rheostat. There are three general
classes of rheostats, so far as resistance rating is
concerned. Hence it becomes necessary to classify
the tubes in three groups, in selecting the proper
rheostat. A rheostat of 6 ohms is necessary for
tubes of 5-volt ratin . A 20-ohm rheostat is used
for the tubes of 3-vo t rating. A 30—ohm rheostat
is used for the 1%-volt tubes. As for the carbon
rheostat, they may be used with any type of tube
since they have a~range of resistance from zero
to 30 ohms or more, thus covering the complete
range of resistances.

REGENERATION AND RADIO FREQUENCY

While it is true that the regenerative circuit is
making way for the radio-frequency circuits, the
fact remains that the old regenerative circuit,
when properly designed and constructed, gives
an ampliﬁcation equal to between two and three

separate stages of radio-frequency ampliﬁcation. "

Beyond doubt, it is the most economical type of
circuit, but, unfortunately, in the hands of the
inexperienced operator it is allowed to oscillate
and therefore becomes a miniature transmitter
to annoy the radio audience in the immediatq
neighborhood. When it comes to loud-speaker

‘ operation, the single—cii-cuit regenerative receiver,

together with two stages of audio-frequency am-
pliﬁcation, gives the best results at the lowest ex-
pense. It is unfortunate that regenerative sets
are in the hands of so many unskilled laymen who
have made this otherwise efﬁcient type of re-
ceiver a perfect pest to_broadcast listeners.

regard to batteries that the broadcast listener

should observe. ~
Use the size battery adequate to the need of the

particular set. It is possible to get results from

 

multiple-tube apparatus with the smallest size of ‘

“B” battery, but the experiment will be costly,
because of the rapid depreciation of current su
ply and the consequent need of frequent renews s.
The number and type of tubes, as well as the
range sought, should determine the size of battery
required.

Be sure that the “B” battery is not connected
to “A".batter_y terminals, as the ﬁlament in the
latter is designed to operate on low voltage,

whereas the voltage of “B” battery is many times ’ ‘

that of the ﬁlament voltage rating.

Use no more tubes than are sutiicient for the
results desired. It frequently happens that in-
experienced operators will have more tubes burn-
ing than are necessary, and then de-tune to les-
sen the volume of sound. For local stations, for
instance, the ﬁrst audio stage is usually suﬂicient.

Tubes should be burned at the lowest point coni-
patible with good reception.
current not only drains the batteries unduly, but
reduces~the life of the tubes. Once the rheostat

is ﬁxed at the proper point, it should not beg-5

touched again.

The ﬁlament should be tuned oil’ the moment’ A

the operator stops listening. Current is ﬂowing
as long as the ﬁlament is lit, regardless
er or not the operator is receiving.

eat. birds and eggs. Many times they kill and
eat sheep, goats and small fowl of the natives.
These animals come into their greatest sphere
of usefulness in the winter when they are used
‘to draw sledges over the trackless wastes of the
northernmost hemisphere. There are no rail-

It is even impossible to use horses in this snow-

When the snow is hard and even a team of dogs '

’ will carry a load of three or four hi:i di-ed pounds

a distance of forty miles a day. Each dog in the
team has a name which it recognizes when its
master shouts to it. Though the masters often
treat the dogs cruelly with blows and kicks, the
Eskimo dog is patient and enduring and rarely
deserts its master for good. Sometimes, however,
he shows his objection to cruel treatment by be-
ing obstinate and unmanageable.

No matter what the climate, the dog certainly
seems to be man’s best friend. He makes himself
useful in many ways. It may be as a companion
to the children on the farm, it may be as a guard-
ian to a great estate, it may be as a pursuer of
men or animals but the dog reaches his highest

here of usefu ness in the Arctic sphere, where
life without ‘him would be next to impossible.

By use of the phonograph records canary birds .
have been taught to sing like nightingales. ,'
' August Mumme of Bremerhaven, Germany,
who raises canaries as a pastime, begins to drum
the song of the nightingale into the ears of the 
little birds almost the minute they are hatched
b keeping a record running all day long and
o ten half the night. p

When the little singers are six or eight weeks -
old, Mumme places them in a cage near real
nightingales, and they are not permitted to hear
the singing of any other ‘birds. Eventually, when '
the canaries begin to sing they quite naturally _
follow the notes they have always heard and, as f .
Mumme says, “feel as if they were sure-enough, .‘
nightingales themselves.”

A canary-nightingale singer is worth about ﬁve
times. that of an ordinary singer among bird fani
ciers. . .

Musk is one of the most penetrating and al-
ready one of the most costly substances em-
ployed in ﬁxing perfumes. It is used as a base
to carry the more perishable and less penetrating
ﬂoral scents, such as rose, lilac, violet and lily of

the valley. Natural musk is said to he so pene- A

trating and so capable of retaining its strength
that an inﬁnitesimal bit will scent a large room
for more than two years, but perfumers dissolve
the natural substance and dilute it hundreds of
times.

One representative of a French perfume con-
cern has lived on the border of Thibet for twen-
ty years for the sole purpose of buying musk
from native hunters. Even at the source of sup-
ply in this remote district musk is very costly.

The only other source of natural musk is the
Altai.Mountains in mid-Asia, but the product
from deer of this range is much inferior to the
Tsarung musk, Doctor Rock.said.
