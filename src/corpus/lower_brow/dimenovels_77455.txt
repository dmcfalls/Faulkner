  *CARTER’s WORK “FOR A FRIEND.

 

By the Author of “NICK CARTER."

 

Niel: had known Guswein for years, and
the two were warm friends. Guvswein ad-
mired the great detective greatly, and on
mere {than one occasion had spent whole
days  getting up wigs and other things
strictly according to Nick's minute direc-
tions.

‘,‘I-Ie vos der most barticular man I efer
saw," Guswein would declare. "But ven ,
der vig vos done, it vos look like nature had
made it, an’ not Carl Guswein at all. alretty !” \

Guswein’s establishment was situated on
the second ﬂoor of a large building on East
Fourteenth street. M ' _

When N ick arrived there he found

with another German, 3  59'.-3‘

   

“Ah, how you vos, Mr. C. l" exclaimed
Guswein, as he nodded, pleasantly to Nick.

He never mentioned his customers by
their names in the presence of others.

"How are you, Guswein,” returned Nick.
 "I vill  vid you in chnst von minute,

Nick nodded again, and the German

such low tones that although Nick could
. understand the language very well. he failed
to catch more than a few stray words such
as “bonds," "best chance,” "I do it for
 you only as a friend," and so on.
_,_ I 7 Presently the two ‘moved over to where
V I . ;Guswei‘n had his large safe. The wig maker
a brought. out a tin box and took from it a
package’ of bank bills. He counted them
; over carefully and then passed them to the
 stranger, who, after pocketing them, gave
 M half a dozen engraved documents to Guswein

  with I smile.
X _“Yes. Carl, and you will never live to
- regret it,” replied the little’ man. “I will

NICK CAHTER WEEKLY. 3

After this he placed the document among
the others and put his camera out of sight.

In a few minutes Guswein came back.

“Here are your bonds, Guswein," said
Nick. “Better put them in the safe again,
before they get lost.”

“Dot’s so, Mr. Carter. I vos a poor man
und gan’t aﬁord to lose me much.”

“When do you expect to see Frederick
Bauermann again?”

"I said somedings apout some ponds for a
friend, and he said he vould see me apout
dem in dree or four days.”

“Oh, all right. Well, if he comes in. ask
him to stay and send word for me.”

“I vill, Mr. Carter.”

With this understanding, the two sepa~
rated, and Nick at once left the building.

Out on the street he called a cab and was

driven to the office.

Here he spent some little time in develop-
ing the pictures he had taken.‘

When they were "fastened” on the plates,
be armed himself with a powerful micro-
scope and then set off for down town.

He was bound for the oﬂice of the Aus-
trian consul on lower Broadway.

When he arrived there, he found he had to
wait all of an hour before he could see the
dignitary, despite the fact. that he sent in
his professional card and stated he was in a
hurry.

“By thunder, but I could see the Presi-
dent quicker,” he muttered to himself. "But
with these foreigners it’s all style and front,
and everything has got to move just so slow
for appeara/nce’s sake."

But at last Nick found himself closeted
with Mr. Ollendorff, the consul’s chief
clerk. He found" the young Austrian very
agreeable and willing to give any informa-
tion in his power. g

"I wish to ﬁnd out about certain Austrian
bonds,f’ said Nick.

“Then it’s a go all the way through?"

Nick's next move was to call on Carl Gus-
wein again.i He found the wig maker at
work over the wigs he had ordered.

“How do you do?” he said, in German,
and then he said he was looking for Fred-
erick Bauermann. “Somebody told me you
knew where he lived.”

“Yes, I know,” returned Guswein, in
German, and at once gave Bauermann’s ad- ‘
dress to Nick. . I

The detective thanked him and went out.
He could not help but smile to think how
easily he had fooled even the man who had
made most of the disguise he wore.

The address given was of a second-rate
hotel up the Bowery. Why Bauermann
should choose such a resort and still pretend
to be rich was a mystery. ”

“If Guswein wasn't so wrapped up in his
business he would see that all couldn't be
quite’ straight,” he said to himself. “But
being a hard worker and strictly honest, he,
no doubt, imagines the world won't ring .
in any swindle on him.”

As rapidly as he could, the great detective
covered the distance to the Bismarck House,
as the hotel was called, and entered the -
oﬁice, where a stout German sat behind
the desk. , g 

“Yah, Mr. Bauermann had a room here,;. '
but he‘ is . gone now," was “K 1991)‘. in

The hotel keeper had the addrem on Third
a avenue and gave it to Nick.

, "Ten to one it's a fake,” thought Nick,
‘ ‘V as he -left. '

' He was right. When he reached the place
he found that a large candy factory occupied
"V . the ground, and nothing had ever been seen
if or heard of Bauermann. ‘

* , “That settles it,” said Nick to himself.

the jaw, and then‘ the second got a crack in
the eye that made him see more stars than
are out of a clear night.

“ Mine gracious!”

“Mine eye vos knocked owit!”

The third man, seeing the fate of his com-
panions, tried to dodge out of the way.

But it was too late. Flinging the others
aside, Nick leaped in front of him, and then
and there that anarchist lost two of his big-
gest front teeth.

With a crash, he went staggering up
against the wall and then fell down all in a
heap.

“Now have you fellows got enough?" de-
manded Nick, who was still as cool as a
cucumber.

“Don’t—don’t kill me!” spluttered the
chap who had lost the teeth.

“I say, have you all got enough?”

There was noireply at this. But the anar-
chists were oowed, and they showed it very
plainly.

“Now all of you "stay there till I get
back,” went on Nick. “If I catch you try-
ing to escape, I'll serve you worse than I
have."

With these words, the great detective ran
out of the room and down the two ﬂights of
stairs, with all possible speed.

In the lower hallway he found the door
leading to the cellar steps locked. But this
was speedily burst open, and into the dark
and foul-smelling hole he descended.

The little windows the place contained
were thick with cobwebs and coal‘ dust, and

consequently the place was almost totally
black. Nick had hardly taken three steps

‘ before he went into a pool of rank sewage

water up to his ankle.

As he came to a halt, he heard a slight
noise in the extreme rear of the cellar.

He was provided with his pocket lamp,

and now took time to bringfit out and turn ,_ .::t

it on.

 

  
 

  

The long ﬂash of light moved over the
rough stone foundation of the house and
toward the rea_r.

— Then for less than two seconds it fell
upon the form of Frederick Bauermann, just
as the man was in the act of crawling
through a narrow window, the iron bars of
which had been broken out.

.“Stop!" called Nick, but the swindler

V the back yard.

[Making this way around the pool of sew-

'” age water, Nick gained the window. The
 lantern was put away once more, and soon
1 he stood in the little yard beyond.

Banennann had disappeared.

 

’ There were several directions in which he

“Did you see McSorley’s grocery wagon

“Oi did thot,” was the slow reply.

“A man just jumped in, didn’t he?”
“Yis.” '

“Which way did he drive?”

“Up that way."
“Was he alone?"
“Yis.”

Nick waited to hear no more.

“He knows now that I am on his track.

Nick started on a run _up the street.

At the corner he saw a butcher’s cart tied

to a post. A
The butcher boy was just taking a basket
of meat into a saloon.

“Hi, there, my friend!“ called’ out Nick. ‘

He sprang to one side, and then some-
thing heavy hit him on the left shoulder.

It was a rough piece of iron, and the blow
caused him to stumble.

Before he could recover, another hit of
iron was hurled at him.

This landed on his neck, and over he
went, dazed and half unconscious.

“Will follow me!” hissed Frederick
Bauerrnann, from behind a near-by stack of

“ If I can escape the police of Berlin, Lon-
don, Milwaukee and St. Louis, I fancy I can
also escape the detectives of New York.

“You think you are smart, but I'll show
you that I’m smarter."

Seeing Nick go down, he rushed forward
and gave the detective a savage kick on the
head.

This ﬁnished the work, and the detective
lay motionless on the dock.

Bauermannn had seen the row-boat, and
now his eyes rested on it with great satisfac-
tion.

"Just what I want to go up the river in!"
he murmured to himself.

Then he looked at Nick and at the oil’

barrels lying about.

“I have a good mind to ﬁnish him!" he
growled, savagely. “He knows too ‘much
about me and the friends I have left be-
hind.” It

The dock was oil-soaked, and many of
the barrels lying near were full.

“Your ﬁrst name?”

“Robert.”

‘ ‘ Where are you from?”

“Vienna.”

“How long have you been here?"

“You mean in New York?”

‘ ‘ In the country.”

“Five years.

“How long have you known Frederick
Bauermann ?” ’

“I don't know him at all.”

“Don’t lie to me,” exclaimed Nick, se-
verely. “You have enough to answer for
without getting deeper into trouble.”

“I haven’t done anything wrong,” was
the deﬁant answer. “You had no right to
break into our rooms ”

“I am not speaking about that aﬁair. I
refer to that other little thing that you were
mixed up in."

Nick knew of no other affair to the man's
discredit, but the shot took eﬁect.

“I—I wasn't to blame," stammered the
man.

“The police know better. Perhaps you
won’t acknowledge that you left Vienna in
a big hurry.”

At this_the man grew very pale. He imag-
ined that his whole life was to be revealed.

‘ ‘I—I——" he began.

“We know‘ all about you. And we know
your real name isn’t Schmidt.”

From this, Schwinn imagined that Bauer-
mann and his two companions had been cap-
tured. His face grew even more disturbed
than before.

“I know Bauermann about four months-
since he come from ‘St. Louis.”

"Where did he live?" =

CHAPTER V.

AN Excxrxnc TRIP on Tim BUFFALO
EXPRESS.

Nick had a berth in the parlor car, but
before going to bed, he wandered into the
smoker to enjoy a Sragrant Havana.

. A _fine imported cigar he considered one
of the richest blessings on earth.

He settled himself back in a soft seat and
here gave himself over to long puﬂs and_deep
reﬂection.

Presently Nick saw a man walk from the
end of the car to where the water cooler
stood.

The fellow got a small glass of water,
poured a bit of brandy into it, and swallowed
the potion with apparent relish.

Then he started to walk back to his seat.

As he did so, Nick cast a glance at him
full of genuine surprise.

The man was Adolph Dingler, the princi-
pal member of the New York gang of anar~
chistic tendencies.

He caught Nick's glance, but failed to
recognize the detective, and quietly passed
on to his seat.

The appearance of Dingler set the detec-
tive to thinking. .

"He has taken time by the forelock and
skipped, just as Bauermann has done.

“-No doubt he is also bound for Buﬁalo.

“ Perhaps the two have arranged to meet
at the Holtzniundt Hotel, and then he and
Bauermann will strike up a regular partner-

, ship in this peculiar line of fraud.

“If that isso, Imust beonhand tobag

them both. ' . i V
“It willido no good to arrest Dinglernow.

a sight for a single moment. "

Dingler sat in a seat by himself.

He had been reading a German paper, but
‘now he threw it aside, and got out a note-
hook and a pencil. '

He began to ﬁgure rapidly, and as he

. so, a smile of satisfaction shone on his
_I_1nooth face. ‘ .
’ Nick did not turn his head, yet by the
aid of a small hand mirror, he took in every-
.. 1 thing that was done. ,
g g  A quarter of an hour went by, and Ding-
‘ = I jxér put up the notebook.
 Just as he did so the door of the car
_ i opened and’ another man came in.
He looked around sharply as if he was on

The little town of Carlwell had just been
passed when suddenly through the mist
directly ahead loomed up the light of a
rapidly swinging red lantern.

The engineer sprang with horror to
reverse his lever and put on the steam
brakes.

There was a shock, and the ﬁre ﬂew from
the slipping wheels, but the heavy train
continued" to move on at the rate of forty
miles an hour.

Fifty feet farther,_ and then both engineer
and ﬁreman saw the rear end of another
train directly ahead!

“By heavens, Bill!” burst from the ﬁre-
ma_n's lips, and with a yell, he leaped from
the cab. A

The engineer set his teeth and remained
at his post.

A fraction of time, so small it could not
be counted, and then cameia thump and a
grinding crash, and then and there occurred
that awful accident which to-day is remem-
bered in many homes to which it brought
death and sorrow. T . p

The midnight express had run into the
rear end of one of the locals.

Two cars of the front train were entirely
demolished, and over a score of passengers
were killed and seriously wounded. T

The engine of the express suffered no 7

further injury than that of being consider-
ably battered about the front.

But_the car directly behind the tender was
thrown upward and to one side, and when it

_ came down it was split from end to end.

This was the car in which Nick was lis-
tening to the conversation of the two crooks.

He felt himself thrown forwafd ﬁnd then
against the roof. T

The woodwork‘ beside him .was splintered

Nick walked out of the hotel.

“I ought to be able to trace them withou
much trouble,” he reasoned, and after

and without "hesitation the detective put his
shoulder to the barrier and broke it down.
The crash was followed by another, and
Nick entered the room in time to see Bauer-
mann and Dingler disappearing over the roof
of a one-story addition to the rear of the
house.

He followed through the smashed window,
and a second later leaped into the little yard
below, just as the men who were gambling
Came out to see what was up.

Scarcely had Nick touched the ground
when an unexpected foe loomed up before
him. .

It was nothing more or less than an ugly-
looking rnastiﬂ.

How Bauermann and Dingler had escaped
the beast was a mystery, but there he was,
standing ready to leap at N ick’s throat.

The brute sprang upon Nick, and in self-
defense the detective was compelled to ﬁre
at him. -

The dog was game, however, and it took
three bullets to dispatch him. In the strug-
gle Nick had his left arm slightly lacerated.

By this time the barkeeper and others
were on the scene. .

"I'll ﬁx you‘ for killing that dog!” howled
the barkeeper, as he struck at Nick with a
club he carried.

‘His blow did not reach the mark, and he
found himself on the 'ﬂat of his back, while
Nick disappeared through the saloon and
into the street.

By this time the whole dance-house was
in an uproar. ‘

The report circulated that the police were

about to raid the place, and the disreputable»

women within grew wild with alarm.
They ran in all directions, and the so-

called respectable men who were present kept a
4 / them company. *

money on the gambling table up~stairs, and

a number went back to secure it.
Once on the street, Nick looked up and

’ down for Bauermann and Dingler, but found

that the two had disappeared.

He asked half a dozen persons concerning
them, but could get no satisfactory answers.

The two had made good use of the little
time given them and skipped out.

“I'll have those fellows or break a leg,"
said Nick, as in a convenient alleyway he
made several changes in his disguise,’ and
then started a systematic search for his
quarry. ‘

At last he came to the conclusion that the
two had gone to the lake front.

He hurried oﬁ in that direction, and soon
reached the docks. _

A crowd was hanging around, and he
learned from one of them, at boatman who
had seen the pair, that they had got aboard
the je.m'e Harris. *

"What sort of craft is that?”

' ‘She's a big lake tug."

‘ ‘Where is she?"

"Just started up the lake."

This was not pleasant news to the gre
‘detective. 1

He nealized at once if this Captain Harri A
was what the man said, Banernianu an
Dingler would have no trouble in inakin
terms with him.

“Do you know how many hands he 25
aboard the tug ?”

“Four.”

“A tough crowd?"

“I reckon so. They have ﬁghts enoug
along the lake front.”

Nick waited to learn no more.

Evidently Banerrnann and Dingler
fallen in with friends, and if anything W
to be done, it must be done quickly.

Before long the tug would be out of sig
and then to follow her would be almost '
possible.

Captain Harris might land the two
on the United States side or he might
hem over to Canada. ,

Dn looking down the street, the gt‘
Etective saw a sign which at once attrac

steam was up in the gauge high enough to

“Here you are, Mr. Detective. Just three
minutes.”
“And here is your ﬁfty,” responded Nick_
“I'll pay for the tug when we get back.”
“How long do you want her?”

“Long enough to run down the Jessie‘

the west?” Nick went on, to the captain of
the tug.

 *

‘ ‘ I believe that is the Jessie Harris. Any— ~

her.”

“Say; I reckon I'll goalong and enjoy the

“Well, here are ﬁve hearty men at your

service.‘
“Thanks.” .

In half a minute more the steam tug had
left her dock and was running under full
head for the open lake.

At first they passed numerous craft going
up and down, but presently these were left
behind and no craft remained ahead but that
which they were pursuing.

The recent storm had cleared away, and
the sun shone down brightly over the rip-
pling water.

The day wore on: and at noon dinner was
served from the rather scanty stores on
board.

About three o'clock in the afternoon the
captain of the tug came to report.

“The Jessie Harris is running over for the
Canadian line.”

“Well?”

“Can you do anything if she gets in Cana-
dian water?” .

"Well, if I can't arrest my men, I can, at

ileast, follow them," replied Nick, dryly.

‘‘That’s so.’'

On they went until the darkness of even-
ing began to creep upon them.

Soon land was sighted ahead.

“ What place is that?” asked Nick.

“That is Port Colbourne."

“At the entrance to the Welland Canal?"

“Yes."

“Then the Jessie Harris isbound for Lake
Ontario?”

“It looks like it."

"We must reach her before the harbor is
gained.”

“We'll do our best.”

The steam was crowded on, and soon Nick
saw that they were gaining on the tug
ahead.

"More steam, captain!" he cried.

"I'll put on every pound I dare, sir."

The steam tug labored along, the engine
groaning from the pressure.

Nick knew as well as did the others that
they were in danger of blowing up.

But still they kept on, and at last the two
tugs were not over two hundred feet apart.

“We are in Canadian waters now,” w
the grim reply.

“Never mind, that detective means bus
ness,” put in Dingler, “and we don't wa
him to catch up with us."

Steam was added, but not a foot could

drawing closer.

“Look here, have you a cannon '

The cannon was stowed away for

It was indeed a small piece, but in a

“Yes. But look here---"

“Give me the powder and a ball, t
you have it."

“Not a shot on board.”

“Then give me a few bits of chain. 7'3
will do even better, perhaps.”

The captain demurred, but all to no
pose. Bauermann and Dingler meant to
the cannon, and they carried their point ,?.

The piece was rolled to the stern ‘
loaded by Bauermann himself.

Then he sighted the cannon, and at the
proper moment touched it off.

Bang!

The report was tremendous, and the result,
of the shot very disastrous. \ 

The two tugs were not over a hundred and
thirty feet apart when the shot was ﬁred.

One tore a hole in the tug’s bow and

wound in the leg, and the Mary Hough was
stopped, that the damage to the bow and to
the Smokestack might be investigated. _

"The Jessie Harris kept on at full speed,

Colbourne and disappeared in the midst of
V the numerous craft at anchor there. '
M _ ‘Nick was much chagrined by what had
' occurred. He took a long range shot at
Bauermann, with his revolver, and had the
satisfaction of seeing 'the swindler drop to
,, the ‘deck with a” wound in his side, how
éip serious he could not tell.
The damage to the Mary Hough was
found to be considerable, and she had to lay
 for repairs, which would take at least an

he deemed it an honor to be of service to so
distinguished a detective from the States.

But certain formalities had to be gone
through with concerning the Mary Hough
and her crew, and all this took time.

When Port Colbourne was reached it was
night.

What had become of the Jessie Harris
could not be learned at once.

But Nick set off on a still hunt and before
morning discovered that the steam tug had
slipped out into the lake again.

No‘ *, the question was, were Bauermann
and D ngler still on board?

“I’ll ﬁnd that out before I make a move
to follow the tug," said Nick to himself.

And then he set to work with unusual care
to discover what had become of the two
adroit swindlers.

“G0 on and set ’em up ag’in, Bobsy!”

“Don't be mean, Bobsy, while yer got the

cash!”

“Gin and hot Scotch, Bobsy!”

The scene was in a low groggery along
the shipping at Port Colbourne.

The place was ﬁlled with lake men and
canalers, a tough gang if ever there was
one.

In the midst of the crowd was a tall, lank
youth, with a ﬂushed face and restless.‘ eyes.

He had treated the crowd once, and now
they wanted him to do so again.

“Not to-night, boys,” he said, faintly.

“Oh, go on with yer!”

“Another round, Bobsy, fer yer health!”

‘ ‘I say not to-night,” replied the youth,
just a triﬂe sharply. “Imnst take my money
homeandpay the rent.’?.\_

» “I won‘t pay for it, Pete,” returned the
youth tothe bartender. " No more to-night."
e ‘ Am-l_the youth started for the door. ‘
But the crowd did not intend that he
‘should escape them thus easily. ‘
: They knew he had nearly ‘thirty dollars.
’ ‘ V on his person, and they wanted him to spend
every cent for cfrinlr.

V It was nothing to them that this lank
sailor lad from upper New York State had a
wife anda baby at home who needed that
money. .

He could go when the cash was spent.
and not before.

“We have run far enough," he said.
“Now come with me.”

‘ ‘To where?"

“Over to the Lord Grasmere House. We
will be safe there.” '

“Are you stopping at the Lord Gras-

ment.

“Yes. Now come on.”

With his hand still on the lank youth’:
arm, the speaker led the way to a well-
lighted thoroughfare.

Upon a’ near corner stood the hotel that
had been mentioned.

Nick——for the so-styled pugilist was no
one e1se—led the way inside and up to an
elegant room on the second ﬂoor.

The sailor was still more astonished.

"Se; here," he faltered. “You did me a
good turn, but what is your gamenow ?”

“You will soon see. Come in.”

And motioning -the sailor to a seat be

Then he removed his tattered coat and his
wig and false beard, and washed his hands
and face at the marble bowl in the corner.

The sailor eyed him narrowly.

"Say, I know what you are," he said,
ﬁnally.

“What am I?”

“A detective."

“You have struck it, my young friend."

“But what brings you after me? I ain't
done anything."

The lank youth tried to speak boldly, but
his voice trembled.

“I think you have done a great deal.”

“Ain’t done nothing, I say.” '

tightly, and, after getting full directions,
set oﬁ fdr the racing m_an’s residence. 7

He found an old-fashioned place, built of
stone and covered with ivy. It stood in the
midst of a grove of cedar trees with a high
hedge hiding it from the road. In the rear
was the stock farm, with several stables and
other outbuildings. '

While Nick stood near the main gateway
to the place, a carriage came dashing up the
roadway. _

It passed but a. few feet away from the
detective, permitting him to get a good view
of the occupants.

Four men were in the carriage.

Nick recognized Bauermann and Dingler.

The others were utter. strangers to him.

The face of one of the strangers appeared
to be full of misery and despair. The other
stranger was smiling sardonically.

“Hullo, some new game is up, that’s cer-
tain,” said Nick to himself. “Hang me if I
think that one mam likes the company he
is in. ' g , V T I g

“I am half inclined to think he is with
that crowd against his will.”

The carriage turned in at the gateway and
rolled up to the side entrance of the great
stone house. . ‘

Three of the men got out and then lifted
out the fourth.

Sure enough, the fellow's hands and feet

were bound.

In a feiw seconds the three other men had . 

their prisoner behind closed doors.

Brandt winked. .
“ I can trust you, Dingler, " he said. “But

“You can trust him,'too," replied Ding»
ler, promptly. “He is about as deep in his

“Then we are three of a kind, as the say-

' “That's it."
“But you haven't told me what brought
you up here?” ~
“We'll do that after you are done wit

“I’ve a good mind to do him!" hissed
Brandt. “He got me in trouble and made
me drop six thonand dollars."
“Suit yourself," said Bauermann, with a
shrug of his shoulders.
“Yes, go ahead, we won't squeal," added
Dingler. ~
j “Mercy! mercy!" shrieked the wretchin

And thus speaking, Brandt disappeared
with his victim.

‘Time for us to act!" whispered Nick to
Chick.

“You take Dingler, and I'll look out for

Bauermann." \
\¢

Thus speaking, Nick threw open the door
of the room and strode in.

“Up with your hands!" he said to Bauer-

mann, sternly.

The bond swindler sprangto his feet in
consternation, while the cigar dropped from
his opened lips to the carpet.

“ Who—what———" he began. " What, the
New York detective?” he shrieked.

“Exactly, Bauerrnann, and the game is
up."

“And it is also for you, Dingler,” added
Chick.

“The devil take the luck!" roared Bauer-
maun.

“We . are caught like rats in a trap!"
howled his companion.

“Caught? Never!"

With a wild leap, Bauermann threw him-
self upon Nick, and seeing this, Dingler
rushed at Chick. _

But the contest, ﬁerce as it was, was of
short duration. .

Chick ﬁred at Dingler, and the ball en-
tered the man's knee, bringing him at once
to terms.

A Nick had no time to use his pistol, but he
struck Bauermann in the jaw with his list,
and over went the swindler like a ten-pin,
and in. exactly ﬁve seconds the man was
handeuﬁed.

In the meanwhile Chick slipped the brace-
lest upon Dingler, whose leg was broken,
fastening him back to back with Bauermann.

“Watch them, Chick. I'll go after
Brandt," said  '

-And down he wen’ into the regions below.

         
 

g .
He met Brandt returning from a stone cell
in which Nasou had been locked. The villain
was taken unawares and soon subdued.

But little more remains to be told.

Nason was at once released, and he offered
to go at once for the Toronto authorities.

An hot! later Bauerniann, Dingler and
Brandt were taken to the local jail.

Brandt was soon after tried and sentenced

T to prison for five years. -

Bauermann and Dingler were brought back
to the United States as soon as the extradi-

. "tion papers could be obtained. Both are now
suﬁering long terms of imprisonment.

Captain Harris was caught in Detroit, and

he, too, was made to suﬁer the full penalty
of his misdeeds. _

Carl Guswein was much astonished to
learn that his Austrian bonds were worth-
less. He thanked Nick over and over again
for the service rendered in securing the
return of most of the money paid for the
bonds, which Bauermann was forced to
disgorge, and the great detective has never
had any cause to regret the work done for a
friend.

RUE detective stories are stranger than fiction. The Shield

I Weekly is a new series of detective stories, but it is “some-
 and boy like nothing better than good detects’-ve stories. We
have, in the past, published many of the old style, where

the detective passes through a series of marvelous and hairbreadth
weekly will contain a history of a complete and intricate crime, the solution
of which is worked out by the skill and ability of the detectives. These are
True stories, absolute chapters of experience taken

thing different.” Street & Smith’s long experience in the
escapes and ﬁnally secures his quarry. The Shield Weekly will,
from the note books of the greatest and most noted

publishing business has taught them that the average man
however, be an absolutely new departure. Each and every number of the
Chiefs of Police in the largest cities of America.

r~ UVCRC.‘/CK

Their fund of knowledge upon this subject has been drawn upon by
special arrangement. We propose to demonstrate to the reading public
of America through the Shield Weekly that the true histories of real crimes
contain as much and more of romance than do the imaginative tales which have
been constructed in the past by the ‘Iv:-t‘ters of detectt'=ve stories. We feel that
the time is ripe for the presentation of this absolutely new class of
detective tales. The ﬁrst number in this series will consist of manu-
scripts from records in the archives of the Boston police, as repre-
sented by. INSPECTOR WATTS, who is well known throughout the
New England states, in fact, throughout America, as one of the sh!-eswdest
and most clever Secret Service Officials in the «world. The great inspectors
of other large cities of the country will figure in due course.
