stopped and said: » _

“Wait for me here. I have business with a
man in thesaloon on the corner. I ‘will return
presently.”

Without waiting for any reply from his com-
panion the lawyer hastily passed into the grog-
shop through the swinging doors and disap-
peared. Hal, standing near the curb, amused
himself watching the sights in the street. Five,
ten, ﬁfteen minutes passed, and then the boy
began to think ‘it was about time that Mr. Hooker
reioined ‘him. The lawyer, however, did noi

.3DP9a1‘y even after the lapse of half an hour.

By this time Hal had grown impatient over

his lengthened stay. Approaching the doors he '

glanced inside. There were two or three custom-

ers at the bar drinking, .but no sign of~Mr._
‘ Hooker. -

_He waited ten minutes longer but the lawyer

He could not understand why Mr. Hooker re-

into the place and inquire. The bar was clear
for the ‘moment, and Hal stepped’ up to..the man
in awhite Jacket who stood washing. some glasses
behind it.. ~ . '

“There ain't no room he could have gone into

"He said that'.”.’ faltered‘ Hal, fairly paralyzed
by the situation. ' ‘ ’

“No. Do you know where Mr. Hooker went?”

“Haven’t the least idea. He didn’t saywhere
he was going.” _ r , . ,

“Then you'don’t know whether he intended to

“I do not. He went away in a cab, taking his
‘trunk with him.” -

“And he left no letter for me?” V \

“Nothing of, that kind. The only. directions he
left was what I just told you. We’ were to ‘give
you your baggagewhen you called.”

Hal was certainly staggered by. the aspects
of the case. Taken in connection with his morn-
ing’s experience at the corner of the.Bowery.and
Canal street, it looked as if the lawyer had de-

Don’t you understand

‘V liberately deserted him——thrown him out on the

world into the streets of a strange city. Why had
he done this outra eous act? If, after bringing
him up from child cod. and in a way that left
no room for complaint on Hal’s part, to throw
him over with such brutal suddenness, and with-
out a single word of explanation, was certainly

. most inexplicable. The boy could not understand.

I-Ialstood like one dazed at the hotel desk.
“I guess I’m up against it hard,” he muttered

' half aloud. . ~

“What did you say?” asked the clerk.
“Nothing,” replied the boy, too proud to con-

‘less his trouble to the clerk. “May——may I leave

my things here a little, while,” he said after‘ a.
gﬁw, minutes’ theught. “I am not ready to take

“Certainly,” 'r:1plied,the cllerk. “'§‘he’3tr can itaéy

“Thank-you,” replied Hal, vhlking slowly to-
ward the street entrance. A * v.
Reaching -the sidewalk the boy stopped to con-

’ ‘g sid'er what he should do. ,

“Evidently Mr. Hooker has washed his hands

done is, in my opinion, downright brutality,” said
Hal.- “However, I don’t intend to lose any sleep

Q The only point that Hal withheld was the fact
that he did not know who his parents were.
.. After‘ spending a couple of hours in the sitting-
‘ ‘room, Hal excused himself ‘on’ the plea that he
‘was tired, and returned to‘ his room. ~He was
up, early next morning and out of the house.
' On his way to breakfast he bought a morning
paper, and while waiting to be served at the

The first on his list was a John street house

 ‘ ‘s John was’ the next street below Fulton,‘ he
would have no difficulty in ﬁnding it. and then

I . .;_ all he had to do was to look for the number -

in the’ advertisement. Having decided to make
his ﬁrst application at that house, Hal boarded
a train‘, and was soon speeding downtown.

He found the place, and also several applicants

not to notice the bag i.n any way just then. Hal,

CHAPTER VI.—-The Stolen Pocketbook.

Hal was sent out twice more that afternoon,
but by using his tongue as well as his eyes, he
found the places he was sent to, and made a
careful note of the streets as he came and went,

just as he had done on his ﬁrst errand, and th s

got acquainted with the neighborhood aroun
the store. ’ _
“It won’t take me long-to get the hang-of the
business section down here,” he told himself, com-’
placently. “How lucky I have been to get ‘a

situation right away, before I had exhausted my ‘:3’;

funds, and how fortunate to ﬁnd a nice family
to live with!” ' '

The store ‘closed at -half-past ﬁve, and Hal
decided that it would be to his interest to walk
around some and learn a few more streets. This
he did till it began to grow dark, when he took
an elevated train for uptown. He knew the
station he had to get ‘out at, so he couldn’t lose
the bearings of his lodgings. He did_n’t go there,
however, till he had eaten his supper at the
same restaurant where he had taken his break-
fast. The cashier, who was the proprietor, re-
membered his face, and the fact that he was
looking for a job.

“Well, did you catch’ on anywhere?” he asked
the boy. ’ - ‘ . _v
“I did. At the first place I struck. The John
street address you told me the way to reach.” , -

“You’re'lucky. I have known people to hustle-
around for weeks without getting work.”

“I have done pretty well for a stranger, don't ‘
you think?” ‘ , ‘

, _“You bet you -have; but then you look neat
and gentlemanly, and that goes a long way in
most places.” _ .A _ gv -

Hal asked about the lay of the “ streets in that I
neighborhood and learned that those: nning
north and south were called avenues, wh e the

4

cross street: went, by numbers, with E. or W.

attached to them, according to which sidelof Fifth
avenue they ran. The restaurant man wrote \
down for his guidance the names ‘of all the
avenues in their order from the East to the North
rivers, and then advised him to purchase a street ‘ ,
map at a stationer’s, so that he could familiar- ~ I
ire himself with the business section downtown A ‘
where he was em loyed. Hal lost no time in get. , ‘
ting a small fpl ing pocket" map of Manhattan ' '
island, and _took it to his room. Before, going-.‘,
into it he knocked at the sitting—room door. Jea- - -
sie opened it and invited him in. I

“I’1l come in for a few_ minutes,” he said; “but
I haveto devote my evenings to studying a street
map Ibought. I wanted to tell you and your
mother that'I_ have been fortunate today!’ in se-
curing a position in a good store on John street."

’ to refresh his memory when he was at fault, and
during the next twq_ days, which endedhis ﬁrst

Hal was glad that Sunday had come so that he
would have a day to himself to explore the city.

preparatory to going to breakfast, when Mrs.

~ — Adams’ appeared and wished him good—morning.

'six"o’c‘lock he'returned to his lodgings. Jessie

‘ to make it pass off all the pleasanter.

“That’s favor number two. Maybe I'll be able

“Good-night,” said .Hal, closing the door.
I On Monday morning Hal "carried the Wallet
,  -downtown with him. He showed it to his em-
' ployer, told him how he, got it, and asked per-
mission to ~20 to Wall streetto return it to the
owner. He received permission to do so.’ He
reached Wall street, and was looking for the
' number,‘ when a gentleman came out of a build-
_ ing, crossed the’ sidewalk and sprang into a
v , waiting cab- Hal recognized him as Mr. Hooker,
 and, he madea rush for the vehicle. He was anx-
‘~?*' ions to have an explanation from the lawyer.
The cab, however, drove off so quickly that his
purpose was defeated. He gazed after the re-
ceding vehicle in much disappointmnt. He might
‘ have chased it, but the chances were against him

Bachelor's office was on the third ﬂoor, and Hal
entered the reception-room and asked for the
broker. He was shown into a private room. ,
“What can I do for you, young man?” asked
Mr. Bachelor. . _
“Did you lose a wallet on Saturday ni ht?”
“A young thief stole iny pocketbook aturda

“I was on Broadway at the time and saw the.‘

beginning of the pursuit. The ‘thief rushed up to
a me. grabbed me by the arm, pulled me around
‘ and then’ kept on.” _
 “Well?” said the broker, curiously, wondering
what was coming. ' I
‘ “He ran around into Twenty-ninth street, with
the crowd after him. When I. reached my lodg-
. ings and was going to bed I found a’wa1let in my
side ocket.” -. ’ ,
“A !” egcclaimed the broker, in atone of inter-
“ est. ‘
“There was a sum of money in it and a bunch
of your cards. I judged. the wallet belonged to
you. Will you give me an_idea of how much
‘ money the pocket book contained?” V
' “Something over $900. There were also valu-
‘ ,-.- able gmemoranda.” ‘
v ’ “I didn’t pay any attention to the papers after
’. , seeing the c_ards. Here is the wallet,’ and Hal
pulled it out of his pocket.’
“That is mine,” said the broker, taking it.
He dumped the money out and examined the
- papers, evidently caring more for them than the
cash. Finding everything all right, he said:

After sc..ie trouble Hal forced one of the bills

on Mrs. Adams, but she positively would accept‘

‘no'more,' so the -boy let it go. at that. , With the

relieved their minds of a great load. Their grati-

wardvone of the clerks in t e store presented Hal

with an invitation to a vaudeville show and ball  
tobe held in Terrace Garden -on theifollowing‘  ~‘

“Come up there and you’ll have a good time,”

said the clerk. “I’ll be there with my girl,Tand

I~’ll introduce, you to her.” . ‘
“Thanks. I, will endeavor ‘to go,” replied Hal.‘

When he reached his lodgin s after supper‘

‘he went into the sitting-room. e showed Jessie

4‘ Mrs. Adams understood J essie’s reasons for re-
fusing so expensive a present, but what would
have been out of the question from any one else

9 7 ‘she regardedas permissible from I-Ial, to whom

 

they were growing more attached every day.

' 5 After some argument Hal tossed a $20 bill into
the mother’s' hands and told her to get Jessie ﬁxed
up for the entertainment, and the matter was so

, arranged. Hal got a new suit and other things
for the occasion, and after supper on the fol-
lowing evening entered the sitting-room to see if

— Jessie was ready. She was, and Hal declared
ghgt she» looked ﬁner than silk, as she certainly

i .

her to perfection, but set off her natural charms
to the best advantage, and the hat completed the
whole nicture. Mrs. Adams regarded her with
pardonable pride, and she was also proud to think
Hal showed so much interest in her daughter.
“Have a good time, my dears. Pardon ‘me, Mr.
Hadley, for the familiarity, but you almost seem
like. a son to me," said the happ.y mother.
“That’s all right, Mrs. Adams,” replied Hal,
breezily. “You are as good as a mother to me,
and your daughter as nice tome as a sister. I
‘shall’ try to give her a good time."
’ ‘ So they went to the big hall, several blocks up-
’ town, /and found a crowd of invited guests en-
tering the main doorway. ,
They secured good seats and enjoyed the show
hugely. . \ . _
“ You will stay to the dance, won't you, Miss
Jessie?” said Hal, after the curtain fell and the
audience were retiring to the side rooms to en-
ablethe attaches to remove the seats to one side
and sweep up the ﬂoor, preparatory to the terps'i-
choreanpart of the entertainment.
“Yes, if you wish me to, Mr. Hadley; but we
mustn’t stay out too late.” . ‘
“We will go whenever you say,” replied Hal.
“You had better go to the ladies’ dressing-room
. and remove your wrap and put your hat away.
. I‘ will escort you to the door, and will look for
you in say ﬁfteen minutes or so.”
Hal put his hat in the gentleman’s cloak-room
and then walked over to ‘wait for Jessie. He
sat on a back chair and watched the crowd around

im.
Presently a sportv chap _’approached with a
young lady in a rainbow attire. She was got up
‘to beat the band, though her clothes were not

‘ ,at‘all expensive. Hal was amazed to recognize
the youn man as Nobby Notman. They sat down
directly in front of him, and Nobby seemed quite
‘devoted to his partner. The youn
ever, seemed to be in an unamiab e frame of

7.  ‘ mind, and did not appear to appreciate his at-

tentions. . ~.

'1 “Now don’t be cross, Tilda,” Hal heard Nobb
say. “What’s the use ~ of my bringing you a 1
the way up here if you're going to be miserable?”

“Don’t talk to me, Nobby Notman,” ‘snapped the

91:  girl; ‘‘I hate you, and Pm ashamed of you.”

   
 

“Well, I must say, Miss O’Brien, that you have
ver little respect for my feelings,” protested
“No by, with an injured’ look.

Tgmjugh he was unaware of the fact, his move-

of a person who took considerable interest

named Adams. .It was like waving‘ a red ﬂa
beforevan angry bull to mention ‘t e name 0
Adams to Mr. Buchanan. ~

Evidently he didn't like the name.
by the name of Adamshad the misfortune some
years before to be lined, u against Mr. Buchanan
in some deal they were hot interested in from
different points of view.

The operator managed things so that the broker
was driven to the wall and was forced out of
the Street. The gentleman owned a number of
cheap ﬂats from which he" derived a considerable
revenue. '

Adams, he did not rest till he ruined the man
and dispossessed him. ,

As soon as he learned that Hal was stopping

with a party by the name of Adams he dictat

a note to a certain gentleman who called 0603",

sionally at his oﬁice and sent it oif by adistrict
messenger. The messenger came back after
awhile with word that the party he had carried

the note to had gone to Philadelphia that after— 
‘noon and might not return for a .‘week. -Mr. Bu-
chanan did not seem pleased at this news, and

with a face thatpsuggested a heavy thunder-gust,
he said more thin s not in keeping with his char-
acter as a. churc '
went home. _ » _

Up to this point things had been going ﬁne
with Hal at the store, but trouble was in store

for him, and it came in the shape of ‘Phil Lang-‘N

don, the proprietor’s nephew.

This young -gentleman was not popular in the _

establishment, as he had a supercilious manner

and a bad temper, and was, moreover, lazy and ,

careless.

Mr. Moore,’ however, for some reason, failed’.

to see the shortcomings of his relative, possibly

because he was not brought into contact with the ,

young man to any great extent, and more prob-'
ably because Phil was shrewd enough to present

* the best side of his character before his uncle,
while he reserved his worst for everybody else.-

Phil had been ‘away ill for a matter of two months

and it was during his absence that Halcame to.

Hal was always tr ing to help somebody, and '1

the recipients of his avers apﬁreciated his kind-

pearance since hisenforced absence. , V ’_
“Hello, who areyou?” he asked surlily, gazing ..

in an unfriendly way at Hal.
Hal had heard about Phil Langdon, and his

crooked disposition, but as the young man was i ’ J‘

“I had an idea that I was,” laughed Hal._

“Who are you, anyway? What are you doing
in’ this’ store? Are you a new errand boy?” he
growled. ,

“I toldyou what I was. Now tellme what I.
can do for you,” said Hal. »

“Say, doyou kmw who I am?” snarled Phil. ,

rightaway, for I'm going to work this morning.”

“You’ll have to wait till Mr. Moore comes, for

‘fDid you hear what I said?” roared Phil, in
a furious tone.

“I heard you, -

“Then why don’t you answer?”

. ‘ , “I have nothing further to say."

' . « .Ph-il doubled up his fists and started for the

‘ “ in and saw Phil with some surprise.

“Hello, ,Langdon, got on your pins again?” said
one. . - ‘ '
Thatfdistracted Phil’s attention from Hal, and

he. got to talking with ‘the two’clerks. Hal put
.,th‘e duster away and went to the shipping c1erk’s
iiydesk at the back of the store. There e got busy

“With the goods he had to sen'd_,away that morn-

. ‘ ‘itigvthrough the store. He‘ hung up his coat and

‘ he walked up to the desk where Hal was ad-

dressing some " tags. ,

V, ‘ began to elbow Hal roughly asi e. _ ‘

 iieverlooked for trouble, but if it came his way
 he believed in taking the bull -by the horns. He
always tried the easy way, if he thought it‘

 the kind of‘ fellow he had to deal with, and he
" decided that the only way in this ‘-case was to

‘CHAPTER XII.——Phil Langdon -Gets What H
1. _, ‘ _ Deserves. -

\

Next morning Hal had an interview with his
 employer. His purpose was not to et back at
“Langdon but to square things for illy. Hal

rehearsed Billy's story, which he supplemented
3‘ with the substance of the interview he had over-
heard between Phil Langdon and the‘ boy. He
" also told the merchant how when he" learned that
"< Billy’s mother was sick" and starving he had
, gI"one with the youth to his wretched home in
~» overty Row, onlyrto ﬁnd that the poor woman
. had died while her son was out trying to raise
'a little money for her. , _

Mr. Moore was rather staggered to hear that
‘his nephew was implicated in the robbery of the
Adams Express envelope,-“and expressed some
doubts of its truth. ,

“Well, sir, you’ll have to look at -the matter

- according to _your own judgment. I am making

‘no charge a ainst Langdon. I am simply inter-

ieve that

. he wouldn’t have taken the money if. he hadn't
. been induced to do so.” .

' ‘(I should like to hear the boy’s statement from
. his ‘own lips,” said the merchant, “and it is pos-
sible 'I y be able to tell from‘ his manner
' whether he is speaking the truth. If I think he
is I shall confront him with my nephew. He will
naturally deny the charge, and the way he’ does
it may show his innocence or guilt. At any rate,
now that the ouestion has been raised, as to Lang-
idon’s integrity, I intend to sift it thoroughly,

ave intended to raise him.eventually
‘to a position of trust, I want to know if he is
’ worthy of my confidence.” I

“llwill see Billy this eveiiin

and W51 have him

1 “Let it be at eleven to-morrow,” replied the
merchant.
“Very well, sir,” said Hal,‘rising. "
‘ Hal met Billv as arranged between them,,and
I after telling him to.call at the store at eleven
" next morning, handed him a dollar. At that mo-
ment the youth spied a policeman approaching,
and with a hasty “Good-by, b.o’ss,’.’ ran up Pearl
 ~Street like a hare with the hounds in full chase.
The officer stopped Hal as he was about to cross

The majority of the crowd was on its feet now.

Two out and the last half of the ninth! .

The game was virtually over.

But Morris * stepped up, evidently possessed v
lvlvith the thought that while there’s life there’s ‘

ope.

He had a strike called -on him, and at the next’
ball he hit out a liner over the pitcher’s head.

Timlin made a jump for it, but only succeeded

in turning the ball out of its course with his

hand.

But it proved- to be a brilliant play, for the ball’
landed plump into the hands of Short-stop Sam.-

That ended the game. '

Rutcliﬁe had suffered its first defeat of the
season, and at the hands of boys’ much their
Junior. ,

But they took their defeat good-naturedly.

With the cheering ringing in his ears, Sam
went to the dressing—room and changed his,
clothes. - '

When he came out he
at the gate for him. .

It was the handsome turnout of the mill owner.

“Sam,” said ‘Mr. Bagley, “jam in and ride
around to the jewe1er’s with us. stopped there
this morning, and he told me your watch would

found a carriage waiting

be ready this afternoon. I am anxious to see it, ‘ V i

and so are Mrs. Bagley and Lena.”

Sam could not refuse the invitation, and blush- '
ing to the roots of his hair, he got into the car-
riage at the side of the rich mill owner. "

He waved his hand to his companions of the "

V diamond as he rode off, and they ‘gave him a_

rousing cheer.

“Short~stop Sam, you are the greatest ball- 

player Sharpton ever saw!" the pretty ‘Lena ei;- _
claimed. .

“Don't ﬂalxer me, Miss Bagley," he answered. .

“I am not; I am simply telling you the truth."
“Well, I only did my best.
and I accepted them.”

_ It was a pleasing conservation that followed, 5
and when they reached the jewelerfs and found

the watch ready Short-stop Sam was happier _
than ever.

When Sam iindertook to "leave them after they i
had inspected the magnificent gift he was sur—,

prised more than ever.
“You must dine with us to-night, Sam,”
the mill owner. “If you have an engageirientﬂ

with the boys you can be back'by eight, I sup-  I
you will not 

pose‘ you can send word home that
be there to dinner.” _ ~
“Yes, r, I can do that.’

He found a little fellow“ who was ready and”
willing to take the message, and then he gotinto» .

, The Mill. Owner Takes Up S,am.’s Case. ~

, _ ‘Taken completely by surprise, Short—stop Sam
ﬂdid not havemuch of a show with.the two men,
who had leaped upon him so suddenly.
‘ It was as dark as a pocket under the row ‘of
‘ trees along the fence, and this gave his assailants
all the opportunity in the world to get the best
..of ;him._ -
, , But’ self-preservation is the ﬁrst law of nature,
fand ‘Sam was one of the sort of boys who always
» think’and act quickly. "
Asa hand clutched his shoulder in a vise-like
 grip and another was thrust over his mouth, the
' 1 boy struck out and. upward with his clenched. list.
It was a blow that was aimed at no particular
object, to be sure, but it landed -in one of the
. ' best spots» that it could possibly have done if it
3 had been well gauged and timed.
~ Sam‘s_ ﬁst caught one of the men directly under
‘ the heart and the result was surprising.
, Down went the villain in a heap! It happened
 that it was the one who had covered his mouth
‘tovkeep him from crying out who received the

low. -

. “Help! Helpl”.yelled the young short—stop of
the. Peerless nine, the moment he had the use of
his tongue. « ’ ‘

 Then he made a mighty effort to free himself
‘~ . from the grasp of the other fellow, striking out
 ’ ‘with both ﬁsts as he did so. _

“Stop that, you young hound!” exclaimed the

,, villain. "Git up, Bob, an’ help me!” ‘
But'Bob did not get up. ;
'=..;The man had gotfboth ‘hands onsam now. One
"clutched him by‘ the shoulder, and the other was
around his waist and pressing hard upon his ribs.
.-By a desperate eﬁort, the boy slid his hand
upward and caught the, scoundrel by the throat.
‘ ‘fLet,’s go, of me or I’ll choke you!” Sam cried.
1 He brought his ﬁngers together with all his
might,‘ anda gasp camefrom his assailant._ ,
«_ _.The boy had a very ‘strong grip for one of his
age and it told on the burly scoundrel- . .
-_ v The arm left the boy’s waist "n a twinkling
and then with a mighty effort Sam tore himself
away and started on a‘ run. from the spot. ’
. ‘ ‘At the same moment a lighted lantern showed
up from the direction’ of the Bagleyhouse. , ,
{There was a muttered oath and then Whiz!

, “What’s the matter, young fellow?” said a

 “Two ‘men attacked me, but I got “away from

 i “So do.-I!” and with thatthe man with the lan-i
