The detective passed to the threshold of the front
door and had one foot on the piazza outside, wheii he
turned again and said: ,

_ “It is very necessary that you all bear in mind the
fact that Lwant no tramp-ing about these grounds at
the present time. The men who committed this out~
rage rnaypossibly have left some traces of themselves
in committing the act. I do not want you to obliterate

v them.” . V T

He descended the few steps to the dooryard, and
several who stood watching himcould see the ﬂashes
of his electric torch while he searched around‘ the b se
of the trurik of the cherry tree, examined the bark
itself; and finally they saw him start away, following
the gravel footpath around the side of the house, but
keeping upon the grass beside it. If

They respected his wishes as he had expressed them,
and did not offer to, follow, but had they done so
they would have noticed that he went forward, all the

‘ time crouched over like an Indian following a. trail‘

—'they would have' seen him presently crossthe grass
toward one ofthe outbuildings and stoop over to ex-
amine a ladder he found there. i » V .

After that he took up the trail again and? crossed the

T - wide lawn, in the midst of which a tennis court had

been made. . .
His. way took him directly across one—half of the
court, and he stopped in the middle of it, dropping
upon his knees andiicasting the light from his electric
torch directly upon a footprint he, had found there
which, fortunately, had fallen upon a space of ground
that was softer than that which surrounded it. i

Presently he straightened  and called aloudithe _

name of" Turner, for he had. already found" that “man

T to] be helpful and consistent; and when ‘Turner, re? _ ..

is, if no mistake had been made in reading the tracks
themselves.

It must be remeinbered, however, that any vehicle
might have passed that way duringfthe night; might
have stopped as this one had ‘done -at both places. Co-
inciclences of this kind often occur ‘to puzzle detec-
tives.“ \

1 / But it was sufficient evidence to work upon, rapd
Nick Carter accepted it as,a ‘basis ‘for his immediate
o'perations. . . ’

Doubtless you who read this have never undertaken

to follow wheel tracks along a country roadway. If;
you havedone so you will appreciate some of the

difﬁculties.
You will know also that there ispa ggreat dliﬁerence
' in the character of roads, and these differences may be
found at short intervals as you pass along’ one of
‘them.  ' .
, In one place "the highway will take you across a
gravel bed where little or no impression is left by
 passing horses or vehicle; in another a bed of clay will
interpose itself, and here,_ if the horses ‘step zotitsicle
r the beaten tracks, or iftthe wagon swerves to theoright
L ; or left "by ever so little, a cliﬁerent “idea of one For the
other may be obtained; for instance, the size, shape
, and character of the horse’s foot may be <determi.ned,
 and there is as great a difference in the ‘sizes, shapes

i,  and the character ~o5*.f horses’ feet ‘as there is in the feet

I of human beings.

i LFurthermore where a wheel track is left to be‘ read

if i by u.ner.ring eyes, the character of the vehicle it bore

along the ‘roadway may ‘also -be conjectured. «For ex— i

‘While Nick Carter and his first assistant worked to-

gether that night along the highway, they covered. a

a ‘distance of more than three miles; they made sev-
eral turns to'the right‘ and to the ‘left; ‘but ﬁnally to

the surprise of both the ‘detectives, the Wheel “trac‘ks;_

took them back again into the main street of the
village, ‘which was hard and smooth and even,‘ and
where no impression of any "sort ‘could ‘be ‘found on
the surfaceof the roadway.

But the fact that ‘those horses had returned to the '

village at all after participating in the abduction was
signiﬁcant. r .

‘Chick looked into the eyes of his chief, rather dis-
mayed hy this new aspect of the case; and he said:

.“\/Vhat do you make of that, Nick? Why should
‘that wagon come back here without apparently having
stopped anywhere along the road?”

“ITl\l tell you what,” said Nick. . “It informs us very
plainly that we must go back again exactly over our
own tracks.” '

NEW NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

CHAPTER X. ..
THE] TRAIL GETS WARMER.

A short distance farther on from where they stood
while engaged in the foregoing conversation, they
found indications such as Chick h_ad described to
show that two vehicles had met there and that both had
stopped. ,

One of these had come from the village, or at least
from that direction, and the other, as we already are
led to believe, contained the stolen girl and her'ab-
ductors. ‘

It was more than likely that she had been passed
from the charge of one party to the care of the other
at that point, as the wheel tracks indicated that the

_ two carriages had stopped very nearly together.

Although the "roadway was soft enough to show the
imprints of the hoofs of the horses connected with
this new vehicle which had encountered the one they
had been following, there was nothing characteristic
about the tracks of either the horses or the vehicle of
the second party to distinguish it from any other that
might have passed along that way.

The detectives felt that they were up against a

, ﬁgurative stone wall in the progress of their case.

It was as if the captors had foreseen this careful
trailing by detectives, and had prepared themselves for
it; had directed that the second vehicle was to meet

' them at an appointed spot and relieve them from their
burden and from their responsibilities.

Nick and his assistant spent more than an hour in

ii trying to pick up and follow the second trail, but at

the end of that time were obliged to confess themselves
at fault, for they could ﬁnd nothing to distinguish the
» ‘tracks from the many others that had passed that way.
“We must return to the village,” said Nick, “and do
what we,can to ﬁnd what became of the white and
psorrel team.” ‘
. “You return to the village and let me go this way,”
replied Chick, pointing
pursuing. '
“\/Vhy so?”
“I have an idea.”
, ,“What is it?” '
~“W'ell, it is rather a far:-fetched one, Nick; in fact.

I '  ‘is only aguess based uponpnothing‘ more substantial
I‘ ‘lthain the mere-thought it may be possible.”

u?“_Nevertheless what is it? I wish to know before I
Ieav'e‘ty.ou~” e
. “I£j you permit me to do what Iwant to do I shall

 “continue along this road in the direction that wagon
V  has been driven, but I shall look in the grass and weeds ‘
' j‘_a1ong'tlie roadside rather than in the road itself.”

. “For what?” '
‘,,“For cigarette butts.”
'a;“«Why, Chick, what is your idea?’

IV“My idea is» that the man who brought the girl

7
_ I away
arsonage did not give her intothe charge of

.~

to the direction -they had been ».

23
“Then what in the world do you mean by-—”»

“I think that they changed places with the people
who were in the other vehicle and that they took the
girl ‘with them.” ’

‘‘Oh, I see.” Q _ _

“If that is so, my cigarette smoker will continue to

leave his tracks behind him in the form of cigarette ‘

butts. If I am correct, I will find other parts of. butts
like the one you lately threw away, and youjwill ﬁnd
none beyond that point where we discovered the ﬁrst
one.” V i

A “It will be rather a diﬁ‘icult sort of trail to follow, it

Chick.” ' .

“I know. It will be a long step between footmarks,
so to speak, but the man with the e_ye—tooth was a
cigarette smoker. He did not relish the good cigar he
was smoking. He threw it away before it was half-
consumed. More than likely he would smoke more or
less constantly, and from time to time along the way
he has traveled I may ﬁnd 'the butt of one of his
cigarettes." . .

“Suppose he turned off this highway onto another,
you will have no meansvof knowing when or where he
did so,” said Nick.

“I will search each direction where there is a turn

untilil ﬁnd a cigarette-butt like the one I seek it it .

takes me a week to do it.”

“All right, Chick. Go ahead. I will return to the

‘village and look there for the horses.”

They parted there. A

The distance was rather more than a mile, but Nick

traversed it rapidly, and finally entered the town ‘at ~

the head of the street just as daylight was breaking.
His first act was to repair to the hotel, where he

"registered and took a room, after, which he had‘ him-

self shaved, and as soon as the stores were opened
procured a change of clothing. Then he sought the
druggist who had brought the plaster of Paris to him

with which. to make the impression of the footmark,

found in the tennis court. _
“Tell me,” he asked, “if you know of a team of

horses in or near this village such as I shall now de-

' scribe to you? One of them should be a white horse

.‘h

or perhaps a gray. Itmay be ﬂea—bitten or. an iron
gray; probably the former. _ The other horse is a sor-‘
rel, or maybe a chestnut with a mane and tail that is

almost red- Such horses. are not common and should-
easily be remembered if seen. The .sorrel has a broken" . .

hoof on the inside of the right fore'foot."’

The druggist had expressed considerable interest
when Nick began his description; by
ﬁnished the man was smiling broadly. ‘-

“Everybody in town knows that, team."

“Indeed?” ' - I

“It.belongs at Hope’s livery stable.”

“Where is that P" - I

“Down the street, almost Opposite the hotel.”

“You bet I do.” .

“A° little bit ago you saw me examine the refuse
taken from the horses’ hoofs.”

“I did.”

“I found still more evidence there that they had
been driven through a swampy ]_)lace where cat's—tail
flags are growing. Previous to that you had informed
me that the horses had been driven twenty miles at
least. It is my opinion, Mr. Hope, that those horses
have been to Binglianfs swamp sometime between the
hours at which they were taken from the stable and
returned to it.” . '

“But look here, Mr. Carter, there wasn’t time after
tine abducti-on of that girl for those horses to go to
Binghams swamp and be returned here before any-
one who he1onge'<l at the stable got here to catch the
fellows at it.” _ r '

_‘,"l'liatH is probably true,” replied the detective. “The
horses did not go to the swamp after the girl was
stolen, but before it."

“Then what in thunder V , .

“W e need not argue the matter, Mr. Hope. iThe
question is, will you drive me to Bingham’s swamp at

“Sure, I will.”

“Then get about it.” Va

The livery man ‘gave quick orders, embellished by
expletives which need not be repeated here, but they
served to acceleratesthe movements of his men, and it

' was not long before a_ light two-seated road wagon was

hitched behind aspair of iron grays which flocked ca-

" pable of traveling thrice the distance required of, them,
and in speedy time.”. ~

Five minutes later with Patsy in the rear seat and '

away toward Bingham’s swamp, Nick having cau-

was his intention to make no particular search until he
did so. ‘ A

Chick was satisﬁed that the second carriage, the one
which had met the white and sorrel team, had at least
started ‘along this road, and he knew that they could
not turn out of it until a cross road was reached, un-
less indeed he should discover where bars had been
lowered in a fence along the highway. ,

Chick had the instinct that he was on the trail. He
often worked on impulses knowing that frequently he V
was beneﬁted by doing so, and believing that if he
were perchance correct in this one, it.would save much (
valuable time to follow. it at once. If he were mis—, 5
taken it would be easy enough then to return and go
qver the ground again more deliberately. ‘ s

N But the road seemed to.be different from others in
many respects. . C '-

It _was not intersected by other highways and cross-
roads. It took him over a ;rough and uneven country
where the vegetation became more sparse and less nu-
tritious with every furlong he traveled.

At the rise of ground he stopped and took his bear-
ings. ‘ , ‘
Daylight was just appearing, and through the- gray i
dawn he could, see that the road now descended grad- V
ually and almost imperceptibly toward timber lands to * V‘
the northwest of him. q_' " ' '

He rested only a moment and started on again, for _.
still there was no turn in the road. _ _ i r y

The way was now easierito travel because the little , _.
grade was not against hfm, and he still ran on*and on; __ 
content to cover distances rather than to search, for pr 
clues which he might not ﬁnd, save by’ losing irnporgé _ C 
tant and valuable time. . ‘ N 

Another mile and then anothbr was passed in this
.way, and then at last he arrived at a four-corners.

Here weeds grew luxuriantly everywhere, and in
the road which crossed the one he had been traveling . i 

 

there was grass even in the roadbed itself. , —.
= He paused there long enough to discover that som—e‘“.‘1; i
kind of a vehicle had lately turned from the main ’road;   A‘
toward the west, and as if Fate had suddenly idecivded  A
to lend him every possible assistance he found lying", ‘
exactly in the track made by the tire of the -wheelgan-*

go, dropping again ﬁat upon’ the ground whenever the
building came into view.

- Thus, little by little, he approached. nearer, and at
last arrived? under the ba=n:l«; of the higher ground upon

‘which the house and the grove of trees stood.

He could proceed now more vigorously but not with
less caution. He was more thoroughly screened from
view, but at the same time he was much closer to the

y M quarry he was seeking. _
He paid no further attention to the wheel’ tracks but,

studied only the house and‘ a means of approaching it
unseen. ‘ k
A thicket of spruce afforded h-im splendid shelter,

and he thought upon how best to continue his search’.}

He‘ knew the importance of discovering how many per-
sons were there in that old house, and of ascertaining
for a certainty that it was the place to which Sally
Cross had been taken.

_ That he had’ discovered the lair of the midnight
marauders he ‘did not for a moment doubt, for what
better place could they ha’ve selected from which to
plain and carry out their ﬁendisl-i acts. as deseri=l'Jed in
the foregoing chapters of this story?

It was a— perfect hidin place or resort for any class
of men who schemed vi ainy of any kind.

“What a place for moonshiners or cou.nterfeiters—!"
Chick muttered to himself at last, when he crawled to
the edge of the screen: of young spruces‘ and gazed out
across the clearing toward the old. house itself.

‘He was not two hundred feet distant from it and
he could see smoke issue from a broken chimney 'which
extended only a few feet above the rotting roof. Much
of that roof. had already fallen in but it showed where
it had been patched in places, thus rendering some of
the rooms beneath it habitable. A

He was well concealed behind that screen of spruces,
but nevertheless he drew the branches still more closely
about his face as he peered outward, and he waited,
hoping that some sign of life ‘within the house would
manifest itself or that some indication might-be given
him how best to continue his“ efforts. v ’

Minutes pass slowly at such a time as that, and it’
seemed to Chick as if hours‘ ticked themselves away,

whiilrehe waited; in reality, less than one hour actually

i \ passed.

Then a man came around‘ the corner of the house
and was presently followed by another one; then a

’ woinan appeared. . ‘ r’

“I’m going over there anyhow,” said one of" the
“I can’t get over the idea that caught a

The man started forward with an oath.

In order to reach the roadway which Chick had
followed he had‘ to pass quite close to where the young
detective was concealed; and‘ just as he reached that
spot he uttered a loud cry of alarm and half turned
as if to run back to the house. , “ i .

At the same instant Chick saw Nick Carterand L
Patsy leap from the roadﬁwayinsto the cl:ea;ring'an_d ”
start toward the house on a run. l

Although surprised, Chick was equalto the moment
and he sprang‘ from his place of conceavlfmentl and  i
struck the man who was near him with his ﬁst, knock-

near the house cried out in alarm and turned to _es-

“Queer place,” observed. Hartla-nd, of the Chinese customs
_:.~. 'sel'rviee-; “it is the first time I have set eyes on it, although
I) .I have been stuck in this benightedi up—river station for the
"' past ﬁfteen months. It is in a very fair state of preservation,
when you take into consideration the,fact that it is over a

 .“It looks it,” laughed Jimmy Santon, second mate of a
' Yangytsi river steamer, who was on a few weeks’ leave of
absence. “The gray and crirmbling walls, eh~!—and the

“I hope you give me credit for possessing more than one
idea,” replied Hartlaucl, with a smile. “But you are right;
there is an idea ‘iizzling,’ as you term it, in my brain, and I
can give you the thread of it in two words—7-opium. smug-
glers.” V

Jimmy Santon. gave a long whistle.

“Is that so?” he murmured. “‘I have heard rumors that
opium smuggling to a large extent has been going. on in this
part of the country for some time, but I did not put much
faith in the rumor. You see, I knew there were some smart
customs ofﬁcials posted in the district, so I ”

“Stow your chaff,” interrupted‘ Hartlond, noticing the
mischievous twinkle in Santon’s eyes. “I am serious. I‘
believe that by chance we have hit upon the principal ren-
dezvous of the smugglers, and if we can run them to earth
it will mean promotion for me and a feather in your cap
as well.” V V

“Then I am with you in this adventure,” exclaimed the
sailor. He pointed to a junk about a mile off shore, sailing
away from the land. “To my mind,” he added, “that is a
suspicious-looking craft. $119 is smarte’r in appearance and
sails better than an ordinary trading-junk; and look at those
marks on the sandy beach. A fl‘at-bottomed boai‘. has been
run ashore there.”

“There is a double line of footprints, too,” pursued’ Hart-
land, “leading to and from the old monastery. Have you
a weapon of any sort with you, Jimmy ?”

. “Not I,” replied Jimmy Santon; “I trust to my ﬁstsif I
get into a row.”

“Not much use in the interior,” said Hartland, “if you
get up against a lot of hostile Chinamen. I always carry a
revolver. Take my advice, if you can lay hands on a good
heavy stick or anything that will‘ serve as a. weapon,,secure
it. We will have a look at the! interior of that building,,_for
I have a fancy we may find something interesting inside.” ‘

“Highly probable,” agreed‘ Santon. “Living Chinamen
or graven images, which will. it be?”

“Both, perhaps,” responded I-Iartland. “With some boxes
of smuggled opium thrown in, unless I am greatly mistaken.”

They dismounted and tethered their onies in a deep angle’
of the building, after which they noise essly made their way

through a jagged gap in the masonry where a window‘ had L,

once been. For obvious reasons they preferred that way of
entrance to the big main door. ' .
Traversing a couple of narrow passages, theyiat length
found themselves in a large chamber, the lofty roof of which
was supported by stone pillars, The end at which they had
entered was wrapped in a twilight obscurity, but the farther
end was more or less illuminated‘ by a smoky torch. ,
Grim and grotesque faces looked down on them from the,
walls, but they paid little heed to them. _Gra.ven images of
horrible aspect might have been effective in scaring off evil
spirits, but the two healthy, strong—nerved young fellows
“would scorn to turn a. hai‘1:”—aS 531111011 Put it. ' .
.The ﬁve livin‘g_ ﬁgures, Chinarricn all‘, who were moving
about as sitlfently ah‘ shadows, looking curiously misshapen in’
the wavering ﬂan-e'of the“torch, did’, however, attract their
very serious attention.’ Two of them were lifting a square

Sauton picked up a broken stick of some hard and very .

“This will do nicely,” he‘ said. ‘.‘If; they show’ fight we‘
shall have a lively time. That big fellow with the unpleasant '

face may prove to be an ugly customer.”

“I know him,” whispered'Hartlar.1d. “It is You-Li. I
have met him often in Hankow; where he ‘awe?’ for an
honest merchant.’ But he has an evil reputat an, arid I am

They continued to. iiiove. slowly forward while, they were .

'soled boots, made some slight noise on the stone-paved ﬂoor, ~

for e'Yen~Li suddenly turned toward them, and catching sight
of their shadowy ﬁgures uttered a sharp exclamation, which
’ ’ brought his associates to his side.
Four of them were armed with formidable-looking knives,
. but Yen-Li had snatched up a heavy military sword, which
he carried presumably in virtue of lis position as leader.

~"We are discovered,” said Hartland. “so we must put a
bold front on it. Leave the talking to me." \
,“Willingly,” replied‘ Santonn “I wish I had that fellow’s
swoﬁd’, though. It would be’ more serviceable than this
stic .’ .

“Hello! Yen-Li l” exclaimed Hartland. “Who would
have thought of meeting you here? I had no idea that you
took an interest in old ruins.” .

Yen-Li started ‘when he recognized the speaker, and his
face turned from yellow——its natural color——to a sort of
dirty gray. He knew that to be discovered engaged in opium
smuggling by an oﬂicerof the imperial customs service would

« entail very serious consequences for him. ‘

“Ah, Mr. Hartland,” he said, speaking in very’ fair Eng-

lish. 1 “What for are you in this place? This too muchee

_p ‘lYours very truly,
 , ‘ “REUBEN CROSs,(
{Rector of the’ Church of Grace,”

~‘ .'When Nick Carter received the ,letter,—it,suggested
only one of those purely local mysteries which some-
«timesaffect a rural community, and which are almost
invariably caused by petty jealousies, or a desire for.
.vengeance for some fancied wrong.
 _ The detective did not thinkjthat he would ‘be. long
.,—engaged. upon the solution of a mystery of thisikind,
 and as it happened that he could sparethe time, he re-
sponded to the Reverend. Reuben Cross by telegraph,
, saying that he would start at ‘once. V _V ,
This chapter opens half an hour after his arrival at
/ ' \ . '
'Westerly, where he was met at the station by Mr.
Cross; in person, and conducted by him to the town
,}ia,lllofithe village, where.every' man of those sub-
'sc'ribers to’the local telephone association was present,
, :awa‘iting him. ' i ~ . _

“ ’Ve’re rather sound sleepers at my house,” he said.
“Besides, I was one of the ﬁrst persons, if not actually
the ﬁrst one, to be victimized in this manner.‘ My
telephone message came after I had risen in the morn-
ing, and had made ready to begin my chores. I was
I “just starting from the house, and had opened the door,

when my telephone rang.

“ ‘Who is it ?{ I asked.
/“ ‘None of your business,’ was the reply.
_ ,~“ ‘Oh, ain’t it? All right,’ says I, and I was about

to hang up the receiver, when the chap at the other
" .end of the wire says:

“ ‘Wait a minute.’ ‘ .

_ and hid in the bottom drawer of your bureau, in the

a spare room?” "
‘ “Well, sir, that sort 0’ feazed me. VVhat that duf-
 ing and the place where they were hidden, was abso-
lutelytrue, and I didn’t wait for no further informa-
tion; but I jammed that receiver onto its hook, and
 ran for the bureau drawer. The stocking was -there,
’ , all right, but it was empty; and when I begun to look
around me, I found that my house had been pretty
generally ransacked, from top /to bottom, and from

 

cellar to garret. ‘ They had just about cleaned me out-

’ of everythingthat I had of value, and not one of us
» inside the house had heard a sound.”
, , “You say you were one of the ﬁrst ones’ who had
' an experience of this sort?” asked the detective. ‘
i “I was the ﬁrst one, Mr. Carter; that is of the gen-
‘ eralomix-up. Of course there has always been more
orless wrongdoing in -‘this community, just as there
, would be in any other one, but so far as the telephone
_ apart of it isconcerned, I was number one.”

John Turner, and I live on the old Bedford place.”

“Have any~of you four men who have already de-

scribed your experiences any recollection of ever hav-7

ing heard the voice before that addressed you over the
telephone, as you have described ?” I

The four shook their heads in unison.

Reuben Cross stood up in his place again.

“Mr. Carter,” he stated, “I should say that we have
been: very carefully through all of that part .of this
investigation. We have even gone farther than that
in thematter, all of which I will describe and explain
to you in due time.”

“Very good,” replied Nick. “What has number ﬁve
got to say?” .

Number ﬁve, as Nick designated the ﬁfth one in the
row that faced him, had ‘had one-third of his ﬂock of
sheep cruelly butchered in one night, about two months

     
 
 

before. Number six had lost a valuable pair ofis_teer,s, ,

which ‘had been driven from their pasture at night,
and which were never found.

Number seven, who owned many valuable horses,"

and who raised thecolts of trotters for the market,
disposing pf them as soon as they had been broken‘ to
harness and had been partly trained, had lost almost
his entire outﬁt of harnesses, blankets, robes, etc., one

night in the same manner, being notiﬁed by telephone ,

as‘ the others had been, within a short time; that is to
say, within a few hours after the theft was committed.

Eight had lost .a valuable stallion,‘ ultimately re-

covered; nine had been told over the phone that an

Percheronlhorse had broken its leg in the stall, and he
had found, upon examination, that the poor beast had

evidently been struck by a club and purposely maimed.

But it is not necessary that we should give the per-
sonal experiences of each of these men.

One and all, every one of the twenty-seven had
suffered at the hands of the midnight iijiarauders, and
many of them had been visited two and three times
some of ‘them four times, and one had been the object
of ‘attack on ﬁve different occasions“ E I

Each one had about the same story to tell, and al-

though there was a difference in time, place, and the .

character of the losses,-there was no difference whali-

ever in theimanner bf any of them, and, without,
