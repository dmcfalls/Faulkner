gathered around ‘an excited broker who had‘_ a
9 young-man by the collar and was charging him
with the theft of his pocketbook. The young man
accused of the theft was making a vigorous de-
nial of his guilt. The broker, however, was con-
vinced that the fellow had his property.
: “‘Search im!” roared somebody -in the crowd.
The approach of a Wall Street detective caused

"saw the accused deftly pass something to another
' "man behindhim. That man immediately began to
vmake his way out of the crowd. Bob appeared to
‘ 7 be the only one who saw this little bit of by-play,
’ and it struck him as suspicious. ‘ . '
‘fI’l1'bet that fellow passed’ the pocketbook to
thepother chap, who is hisconfederate. I’ll just
follow that man and see where he goes.” _'

' With this resolve Bob worked out ofthe mob in
,time to see the man «whom he believed now had
thévipocketbook vanish around the corner {into
Nassau Street. The man walked brisklyvup -the
 street, and Bob followed him, on the other side of
the, way. He crossed Pine Street in an uncon-
cerned way, and pursued his way along Nassau
Street without further anxiety." He believed fall
waswell-. Bob kept him in sight, pretty well con-
vinced, that he had the stolen property in his‘
possession. The man he was ‘shadowing kept
straight {on till he reached the north corner_1of’
Spruce Street, and then he took up his position
under the shadow of the Greeley, statue in front
of: the “Tribune” oﬂice. ' Bob stopped in front of

money broker's oﬂicelon, the west side of Nas-»

His companionﬁred the pocketbook under the,
table in disgust, finished his beer, and got up. V _. _

“Come on," he said to hiscompanion; “Let’s be'- ~ .,
gettin’ on.” ' . ' ', _

As the thief started to get up somebody came
toward the washroom and Bob had to draw back.
When he walked out into the saloon the rascals I
were just oing out of the door. A glance under ‘ »
the table showed the pocketbook, half open, on the.
ﬂoor, with part’of its contents scattered around.
Bob dived under the table, gathered up the‘ papers
that lay about, and, took possession of the pocket-
book. When he reached the sidewalk the rascals
were not in sight. On the way back to Wall
Street Bob wondered what kind of a detective he V.
would make. . _ ' v. . ' » , I

Some people are more observing than others,
and Bob had that‘ facul pretty Well developed
by nature. When he rea ed his oﬂ‘ic‘e he opened
thenwallet to tryand ﬁnd a"-clue to its owner, for‘ . i \-
he meant to return it, and explain the- circum— V',.
stances through which it had come into his posses: "
sion. The first paper he picked out of one of the
compartmentsrwas folded in half, and Bob opened
it. It was written in. ink, and ran as follows: 7

“Dear Mountjoy: On receipt of this notification '
getbusy, andbuy every share of H. & Q. ‘you’ can

Bob read, the paper mechanically, and then, as _- 
its’-real" signiﬁcance impressed him, he read it " 
again more carefully. ' - ‘ - W " 6

usual "memorandum, and Bob started for the Mills

corridor, he soon, found the oﬁice he was looking

the broker. ,
“Yes, sir. Did you lose a pocketbook to-day?
Mr. Mountjoy looked at him sharply. . l

' ' He wrote up a inarketletter and had a number

of copies. typewritten, ;which he fprwarded to his

' correspondents. He decided to this every day for

a week or two, in an endeavor to catch a new

customer. The result was he got two customers.

One sent an order for 20 ‘shares of U.

the other an order for 10 shares of D. & H., both

on margin. Bob turned the orders over to Broker

Sands to execute for him. He continued to watch

H. & (2., which was beginning to attract some
attention from the traders in the Exchange.

_ “.It ought to go to 90,” thought the boy broker,

. as he stood watching the ticker in his oﬁice; “but

what it ought to do, and what‘ it will do are horses

of a different color. Everything depends on how

strong the syndicate is, and what‘ opposition the

combination meets with from the.bears. A strong,

organized raid might send/the members of the

syndicate to the wall, and in thaticase I’d be

caught in the slump, too. I tell you a fellow takes

desperate chances down here playing the market.

You never can tell where you are at fromone

 hour to another. Still, you can’t make money

without taking chances. I have to take. more

‘chances than a capitalist because I haven’t any

money to fall back on to save myself, in case of

- ‘ that is not- to put up over half your money; but

when I get hold of a good tip I can’t help playing

' it forall it. is worth, for tips are as scarce as

‘ hen’s teeth. Inthis deal I’m trusting largely to

luck, just as I did in the last one. If the syndi-~

" cate pulls through so will I, if I don’t hold on

/ , too long; if it goes up the spout, I’1l ascend, too.

V » It's an exciting game, all right. Keeps a fellow

Bob decided to visit Elsie Thorpe and her

J _ fter supper he put on his best duds, told his
 mother where he was bound, and took an Eighth

the number -he was looking for at ‘about ei ht

 Heﬂwas used to climbing three ﬂights to his own

, CHAl’’TER VII.—Trouble at the Exchange. I '

 A few days after Bob’s visit to the Thorpes the
 market began to boom all along the line._ H. 8:
 then jumped in an hour up to 85, and caused
‘ a run on that stock. The traders fell over’ them-
/:_selVv'eg in an effort to buy it, andthere were great
,doings on the ﬂoor. _ ‘ p _
advantage of the general situation to, boost it
In and as the stock was practically cornered, they
had no great trouble. As the price rose, apoint
"at a time, the wildest excitement began to reign in
éthe Exchange, especially around the H. & O. pole.

Alittle before three, H. & Q. reache 90. and
Bob notiﬁed Mr. Sands to sell out the 1,0 shares
held .for Mr. Cutle-r’s . account. Then_ he went
around to the little bank and ordered his own 500
-to .be~so1d. The Exchange cl‘osed before this or-*
der could be transmitted to the bank’s bi-oker_ on
the ﬂoor, so the-order went over till the morning.
Next morning Bob’s shares were sold at 91 1-4.
The excitement at the Exchange still raged _un—__
abated all morning, H._ & Q. going to 95, notwlth‘
standing that the syx_idicate,was unloading as fast
as it could through its brokers. The lambs were

had cote from lunch, and was talkingvto Broker’
lqsands, just inside the main entrance to the E_
change, when a terrible racket attracted their
attention. - ~ ,  ,
“Hi” & Q. will be the death ‘V of somebody, Im
gfg-a,id‘,". remarked Sands as the uproar reached
5 their ears. ’ “Your customer w lucky to sell out
in time. He did wisely. This is_ his second coup
{glinough you. He ought to consider you a lucky
- ird.” ‘. ' .
 “I. guess he does,” laughed Bob. V Y ,
, ‘ .At that moment a broker came out, ﬂushed and

elicited. _ i , ;
5 “What’s. on the tapis now?’ asked Sands.

.“H.‘ '& Q. is on the ragged, edge. Jordan
_ dumped 10,0Q0 shares on the market in a lump,
and Lumley followed suit. The price dropped ﬁ_ve
._p'ointg rightlaway, and is going lower‘ every min.-

 

 

The speaker hurried out into the street, and the
noise inside grew more tumultuous. K‘
I’. “Gee! ‘m glad I'm out of it!” muttered t e
 bung bro er as Sands «hurried inside to see, how
7li:eUcouId ‘beneﬁt by the situation. _ ..
Bob managed to get .a lookrthrough-the doors,
..gaL1id.saw that the floor was like a raging tem est
'~at.sea..'. Suddenly a-wild-eyed broker, named an-
gaznstaggered out into the corridor where Bob

“Ruined! Ruined!” he gasped. “Every dollar
swept away!‘ Jordan and Lumley did it. They
broke the market just when expected to realize
a fortune. If ‘I only had a revolver, I'd shoot
myself right here, and end it all!" .

Just thenout came Jorda'n,.Lumley, and an- » V

other broker, laughing, and rubbing their hands
in great glee over the havoc the ﬁrst two had
created. The mo ent Hannigan’s eyes lighted on
them a maniacal ightblazed from them. With a
how] like that of a wild beast he sprang on Lum-

ey. V . .
“Villain! You’ve ruinedfme! I’ll kill you!"
In a moment he had the broker by the throat,

and was hearing him to the ﬂoor. - '

“Help!" gurgled Lumley.

Bob saw that Lumley was in a tightﬁx, for
the light of murder was in his assaiIant’s eye
He rushed. fprward. and seizing Hannigan’é ﬁn-
gers, tried to tear them from the throat of his
victim. ‘Jordon and’ the other trader ran to the
rescue of their friend, too. They seized Hannigan
by the arms and tried topull him away -from
Lumley. Other brokers came upon the scene, and
jumped to the rescue of the choking man. .Bob,
however, saw that something more than ordinary
was required to save Lumley, so he hit Hannigan

a heavy blow in the stomach. The crazed trader

doubled half up and released one hand from Lum-
ley’s throat. Bob took advantage of the chance to
wrench the other hand away, and the unfortunate

victim of ‘the trouble dropped unconscious to the .

ﬂoor. While Hannigan was wrestling with his
captors, Bo_b’brought a glass of water and dashed
it in Lumley 5: face. ‘It produced not the slightest’
effect. He ran and got more, then loosened the
brokei-’s collar and tie and began to bathe his face.
Lumley looked so like death that one of the brok-
ers telephoned the nearest hospital for an aim-
bulance. The corridor was now jammed with ex-
cited brokers, asking what had happened.
.“Do~n’t crowd. gentlemen,” begged Bob. “Give
him air, please.” i . A -~« ’
The boy was’ the coolest person in the gathering,
and it was chieﬂy through his efforts that Lumley
was brought around and ﬁnally opened his eyes.
In the meantime‘ Hannigan had been subdued and
carried into an anteroom. He was almost. , a
raving maniac by this time. The slump in H. 8;
Q. had sweptiaway eve dollar he

-and he was subsequently removed to the insane,’

" building without saying a word. Next day, when
_ Bebvgot settlements from Mr. Sands and the little
bank, he found that he had cleared $9,500 on his
own deal, and that Mr. Cutler hadniade $18,000,
of which amount ten per cent. or $1,800 came to
the boy broker by agreement. Altogether Bob
was $11,300 winner through his H. 8: Q. tip, which
raised his working capital to nearly $17,000.

 

i -(VZHAPTER VIII.—-—Bob Gets a Lady Customer. ‘

Bob captured several customers through his ad-
vertisement in the papers, and received many let-
ters asking for market information. He found
that it was necessary for him to write up a daily
market letter, have it typewritten a dozen or more
times, and mailed to each of his correspondents.
After thinking the matter over, and realizing; that
his mail was growing bigger all the time, he con-
cluded that he would have to get a stenographer.

“I’ll hire Miss Thorpe,” he said. “l’ll be able

to get her reasonably cheap until she gaiiis ex-
perience, and then I can raise her wages."

So when he paid his second visit to the young
lady he made her a proposition‘ based on the
"wages she was getting as a salesgirl. -She ac-

cepted his offer and agreed to come to workfor
him in a week. _

- “Now that I have hired a typist, I might as well

have an office boy. I haven’t much for him to do,
it is true, but he can ‘be ornamental as well as
useful. ‘Anything, in fact, so that he puts in his
six hours a day.”

and next morning, when he came down to‘ his
office, he found the corridor full of boys ‘of all
 » .-ages and sizes, looking for the job. The young
 ‘broker surveyed the applicants, and selecting, the
‘ smallest youth in the bunch, told him to walk in-
side and he’d talk to him. The little fellow, whose
name was Clarence Mulligan, proved to be so
bright and ‘intelligent that Bob hired him; He

- then went to-the door and announced that the
‘ gosition was filled. The otherboys, who num-
ered about ﬁfty by this time, received the intelli-

,. gence with disappointment and disgust. They set

young broker then decided l‘.hElt{_l1e would buy
some D. &.H. himself. '1 . ,
“I'll bet Mrs. Brown’. friend’ has got a tip,

his way to his safe-deposit vault, when he took ‘
$40,000 in big bills out of his box, leaving only
$2,700 behindto keep the box from getting lone-
some. Then he called on Sands.

“I’ve ot a good—sized order for you this
Mr. San s,” he _said. .

“Glad to hear it. The bigger the better.”

“It will take $328,000 to swing the deal.”

“The deuce you say!”

“I want you to buy for my account 4,000 shares
of S. & T. at the market. Here is the margin,'
$40,000." ~ . . 

“For your account?” repeated Mr. Sands, look—;
ing at the young broker. ' .

“Yes. The deal will go in my name,” ,

“You must have caught a swell customer this.

“Yes, he's a good customer, all right,” ‘grinned’!

As soon as Bob got his memorandum here-r" ‘ ‘
turned to his own otlice. His desk stood close to \
the window, and he "noticed that a couple of_ paint-: I 
ers stood‘on a scaffolding outside, paintin . the
brickwork. The roof of the adjoining bui ding»
was only as fewjeet below. and the painters would - .
soon ,be- throughwith tlfei? work.’ Bob read. tzhe“ '
daily ‘market report a while, then he tookfsome,
papers out of his safe and laid them on~the aor- , _
ner of his desk near the window. The top one was“  ..
the certiﬁcate .for 3,000 shares of the El‘ Dorado} '
mine in Paradise. Nevada.’ This mine had turned}
out a failure, and had lately been taken offthef 
list in the exchanges. Bob was out just, $30," 
which he had paid .N.[I‘.S.‘BI‘.0Wn for it, and he in—;‘ " '
tended to have it framed as an object lesson._ , ‘ -
When he went to lunch he meant to take’ it up 5. _ ‘ 
toga Nassau Street picture store and leave _it to be‘ » ..
ﬁxed up_in good shape to be hung on the wall oi
his ofﬁce. About noon time .Al Wise dropped in to '2,

wiclies, pie, and a pint bottle of milk each. It is».
unnecessary to follow themthrough the—..details-
of their trip. It_ is enough, to say that they ‘en
joyed their outward ride hugely, and that noon ,

‘ The hedge partially surrounded an ‘old and
abandoned mansion that stood back ﬁfty feet or 
from the road. It had been built and occupiae,
by‘ people of means. ,An intricate lawsuit carfie
on by the heirs was the reason why the ﬁne ‘build .

to~go to rack and ruin. The boys, however, ,

CHAPTER XIII.—Miss Minto

Bob reached his oﬁice that da about half-past’
one. His office boy and Elsie horpe were won-,

' "daring what had become of ‘him when he walked
m .

“I was afraid you might have been run over ~
by an automobile,” said Clarence Mulligan, the
office boy. ' _ i g
"I thought maybe you were sic ,” said Elsie. _ 

“From eating too much turkey and.mince_ pie ?" T ‘
chuckled the young broker. “No; I and my friend,

Al Wise, were up in Westchester making it warm ' , Q
for a couple of crooks who committed a robbery

‘and their ,.efforts to get hold ‘of the stock stimu-2 ‘
'lated_ others to do the same.  V '

On the following day the price rushed tof10G in

‘on, and. the price reached 106 before heitold Mr.’
‘of ﬁfteen ‘minutes this 4,000 was disposed’: tpga-1;

Bob then told Elsie about his and A1’s adventure’
at the big old, deserted mansion in’Westchester,§' ,
to which narrative the oﬂice boy did not fail to' ‘
lend an attentive ear, for it sounded very much? 
like a chapter taken “out of one of his favorite. . ‘-
books. . When Bob turned to his desk he picked.‘
up the tape, which had been ﬂowingout of the-!‘
ticker all day, and looked to see what, if anything,»3 _
had been doing in S. & T.‘ It ‘had gone up a{ '.
point and a half, therebyvmaking him richer by, ;
$6,000 more, which naturally made him feel good  "
As he picked up the morning’s market report toi 5

Broker Lumley. ‘ . ,1

“I dropped in to see if you had made use of,‘ ,:'
my tip,” he said. ,“You_must have noticed that? 4‘
the price ‘has gone up 4 1-2 points since‘ I put you  _
wise on the subjec .” g‘ g p . . ‘ “
. “Oh, yes.‘~ I_put all the money I could spare‘; _
into the stoc ,”- re lied Bob. “You think it will be‘ . ' _
safe to hold on til it reaches par?” . 2 _ 7

f‘Yes, from the general outlook. Should any» ,
thing.~ha_.ppen_to make it dangerous to hold on to 0
that limit I will notify you.” ‘ -. ~

“Thank you, sir,” replied Bob. _. ~. ..

Mr. Lumley. then left‘. Bob put in the ‘rest of - ,4
the time up‘ to the hour ldie ‘Exchange closed ‘
watching the ticker, and durin that time S.»&.,T.
advanced another half point, e osing at 87. . Next
day it went to 89, andthen the brokers began to ‘ 3
sit up and take notice that something was doirig‘ _ ,
in the stock. Variousxeasons were given for the.‘ " ’
rise, and all sorts  rumors circulated about the
Stree_t,j‘rnahy of _them being sent out by the syndi-
cate in its own interests. At any rate, there was
a rush to buy S. & T. .on..the part of many brokers,

went to 92. Those who had succeeded in haying

in U. P. could be managed.

‘ that this wasn't the ﬁrst deal that Miss Minto
had been in, for she put on more style, and dressed

- percent. of any proﬁt I make out/*.o»f it.."V . ‘

“What's that?” asked Bob with sudden interest.
“A corner in U. P.?”

“Yes, sir. She. says U. P. is selling for 126
now.” ' . ~ ‘
“I guess it is.” 1 ~ ’

“She told Miss Tho e that her boss. and some
other men have forme a syndicate to boom it to
150 ’ '

“Did she explain how'she found out about the
matter?” - .
- “Yes, sir. Iheard all she said, and‘I’ll tell you.
Maybe you can make something out of it.”
Thereupon Clarence repeated the exact sub-
stance of all Miss Minto had been so imprudent as
to let out- Bob listened with earnest attention,
for he scented a tip of the first magnitude. He
had heard something about a rumored corner in
U. P. but the information aroundthe Street was‘
so indeﬁnite that nobody could put any faith in it.
As Bob knew that Miss Minto‘ was .Mr. Hazen’s
conﬁdential stenographer, it began to look as if,
,there was something in her statement to Elsie,
and the young broker determinedto investigate
the matter thoroughly. ‘

. So, after he had got all he could out of Clarence
he went over and questioned, Elsie about the '
matter. At first she seemed reluctant to say any-
thing,’ as she promised Miss Minto that she would
be mum, but Bob got admissions enough from her
to convince him that his office [boy had stated
nothing but the facts. Bob then Went aroung
making sundry inquiries, and found out enough 
to assure him that Broker Hazen was buying r .
U. P. wherever he could get it. He then gave an
order to Mr. Sands to buy 5,000 shares of U. P.‘
for his account. The stock cost him 126 3-8. ..

,Two days later it waslup to 128, '.l1hen he gave
Mr. Sands another order to buy 5,000 shares more.
As ‘soon as_ Bob was in on U." P. as far as he
intended goin , for he was playing for a mighty .
big stake, ‘an taking a pro rtionate chance of
getting cleaned out ‘throng some unexpected .
move ingthe stock market; he went around to.‘
see Mr. Lumley. , ' . .

“How do you do, Sage?” Glad to ‘see you.‘ '
How did you come out on S. & T.?” asked Lum-‘ .

- ley

1!! “At the top of the heap, sir.” , , ' ‘ j 
0 “Glad to /hear. it,”*replied the broker heartily,
{who supposed Bob might have made $10,000 _at‘the
outside. “Anything I can do for '-you to-day?”

“No, sir. I thought I’d come around and give
you a tip in returnfor the pointer youhanded
me.” . " ’ V. .

“So you think you’_ve, got hold of a tip, eh '3” _ - 4j

“I think so well of it that I have already backed . . 7

“Let me hear what it is,” said Mr. Lumley with.

Miss Minto, and stated. all the facts. _ V ‘.-

“By George! I guess you’ve. got the goodslall.

The traders were now
to buy it, as Sands, Lum ey, and other brokers
in their-interest, circulated word;of the consoli-
dation around. ‘ The brokers bit greedily at ‘the
bait, and Bob directed his brokers to let his‘ stock

-’_,all,go' at 60, which they did, and then -withdrew.

Thus Bob. by a clever maneuver, worked the
market for a proﬁt of $375,000 without waiting
for the actual conﬁrmation of the consolidation.
V. -This came out next day, as the insiders had no
further object‘ in delaying things; but the price

Still you don’t quite grasp the situation, I

see,” continued Ben. “You seem to have missed
the keynote in this whole business. When you
looked over these diamonds you overlooked the
‘Great Ghorgee and threw it away with the imi-
tation crown jewels which now lie in that rub-

zmbrning we were in hopes that this -was not
so, and that you actually had the big diamond;

, the case, for you came for no other reason than..,

will spare you the trouble of searching. It "is
not there. I have searched the heap thoroughly.

»you opened the package. , Now, what light can
you throw upon it, for it ‘must be found?"

« detectives remained silently waiting, however, and

played, should not suggest‘ that Dr1,Pajaro.1iad-;,

By this ’time they had reached .the end of

Willawas far gone now.

He could see only the doctor. He believed now I

that it was the ‘doctor.

7 All recollection of the detectives and the _;
crooked examiner vanished from hisrmind.

Everything was the doctor. As they walked
along he kept his eyes ﬁxed‘ upon his strange
companion, who now no longer held “his "arm,

Still another turn—now theypwere in Albany

place also. .
What had possessed him to go out of his way

he should have gone driectly down Rector, was

a question Ben Bolton often asked himself in ' ‘I

How‘ he was received on this his second, visit

Well, as it turned out, the crooks put it upto

had gone. 1‘. a

They had timed the officer on that beat, and at
half-‘past twelve he was invariably at the other “
end of his beat, ﬁve squares away.

The police business at that time was run in a
haphazard way, and an officer could sit and sleep

‘in a doorway or patrol his beat, as he was inclined.

It was a pretty good man on that heat, but he

V was a slow walker, and fond of his pipe.

As his smoking was mostly done at the other
end of his beat, he was certain to take his time-
aboutcoming back. ‘

Did I have my suspicions?

I‘ did, sir. ‘ , -.

Beggingpardon for what seems like boasting, V ,.
but I was accounted a very sharp boy at that age, ' '
and I think I, realized father’s responsibilities more
than he did himself. v I I

I was always giving him a word of caution, and
the very ﬁrst time I was followed I suspicioned
that some evil was intended, and I warned him
not to open the door until I had knocked.

The next night the two men were close at my .
heels and I would not knoclruntil they had left me.

Father agreed with me that it was best to be
cautious, and next day the old gun was discharged
and loaded anew.» - .

‘_I was.foll_owed on the’ third, fourth and ﬁfth
nights, and it was on this latter night that the
climax came. , ' ‘i

As I left the restaurant I was joined by one of .
the men, who claimed to be a vessel owner, and g

\ ,

He gave me, a lot of taffy about my being the,
smartest boy he ever saw, and wishing to do
something for me, and as we arrived at thebank I
door he h lted with me, and said he would step in _— 
and see f ther. ' , " — « '

I At the ‘same time I saw the policeman smoking ._ ‘ ’

- his pipe in the next door. '
I - Now, sir, I hope you won't lay itupzagainst

me for saying that I tumbled to the racket at
once, for thatis the solemn’ truth. ‘ « . ‘

While I swallowed none of the taffy given me, I
no sooner saw the policeman at that point with his
pipe alight that I twigged him for a pal in "dis-
guise. ‘I ‘ ~A '.—  I,
’ I had been observing things‘ for two yeard, mind
you, and such an innovation‘ was not to be -passed

I explained to the man thatit would be against
the rules to admit him, and that he ‘must see

I saw that father wastdown and both men on top

They had his head covered with a cloth, and
though he was calling out, his cries. could not have
' been heard ten feet.
The cot was at the left as you entered the bank,
and the ‘gun stood at the foot of it. _
Just the minute I was inside I realized what
was going on, and the first move I mad.e was for
the gun. .

* villains, who had been sitting on father’s legs,

bar, and then sprang up and faced me.

'7l ‘age and_ determination. .

The homes of all were on the other side, of the"
river. in the Canadian Sault. ’

Young Tessier danced while his companions’
clapped and sang, witnesses said. He moved

. slightly from‘ the middle of the boat, lost his bal-

ance, and, toppling over, capsized the craft. Per- '
sons on shore immediately set out in boats to the
rescue, but the, six victims sank before help could
reach them. » , i

. The bodies had not been recovered tonight after
policemen had dragged the riverfor hours.‘

THE CUTTING OF SPECTACLE LENSES. . vi:

“The work of cutting is all performed "with a
tiny fragment of diamond, knownin the trade as

.a spark,” said a manufacturer the other day. _“'It

is not every spark, however, that will cut a’ lens. " -Z

.The sparksare mounted in the following manner:

A piece of brass wire is selected, say 3-16 of an
inch in diameter, a hole is drilled in the end large ~ .
enough to admit the spark, and it is set in the hole
with the point up. The other edge or shell of the
wire is beaten‘ inward and holds the spark ﬁrmly -
in place. The wire is then placed in the lathe and ‘ ‘
cut‘ off just back of the spark, turning ‘the,.end ‘
hemispherical, using the point of the spark that .;-
sticks through the brass as a center. A piece of ‘
steel wire is next selected, of the same diameter as
the brass wire, and the end is turned in, fornjii

a cup. The mounted spark is then soft-soldere . '7
into this cup and it is ready -for‘the machiney; ‘

,which works automatically from a pattern and

canbe set to cut larger or smaller than ‘the‘pat.- .
tern. Before the mounted‘ spark is placed in the r
machine, however, it is tested by holding the
handle upright._»If_it'does "not cut in an upright.
EOSIIIIQH, the point is unsoldered by means of the
lowpipe and the handle resoldered, leaving‘ the
cutting point at therequired angle, while the han-
dle itself is upright. ‘ c '- p ,
_When the spark is found to out well in‘ an up- .
right position, it is then placed in the machine for ‘
trial. The glass is placed uponatpad under the.
spark, the glass varying in form according to the =
kind of lens being cut. If the lens is ﬂat, the cpad
on-

cave, and must be a p_erfect"fit, for the‘ better the
fit the -more accurate will be the work. The pat-
tern and‘ lasswtravel argun-d while the diamond
remains st ti‘ona_ry. , . -,.

The life of a spark is short, some being 
‘one. day, while once in a while they can be worked
for a year. The workmen average ﬁfty dozen 

on an average of 1,500 dozen pairs. ’I‘he.'av'era,'ge ‘
len_s measures four inches around, and a dozen’
pairs would be eight feet. _ In ‘cutting 1,50,0‘doz'e’n_. "
pairs the spark would travel over a surface equal
to’ a_piece of glass 12,000 ‘feet long. — There, are ei-
ceptional sparks that cut for months. I~now have, ‘_:._"_
one which has been in operation for ﬁfteen>.n1ontl1an_’;
and has cut 7,200 dozen pairs, taravelin‘ ,ahoii‘_b
6f(,7600 feet. We use two kmds,of~sparks, the 
‘ggian aﬁn.d the African, and they cost froms ‘to. -
