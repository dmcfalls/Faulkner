it from the backs of their horses.
. , _, They saw that it was wide and deep; that it was

' supplied by a mountain stream that ﬂowed into it
-{above and at the rear, and which ﬂowed out of it
= through an iron grating at the western extremi.ty.

But they were not given much time for this inspec- V
tion, for the warder and half a dozen soldiers were
standing at the base of the drawbridge,»awaiting them;
and now the warder stepped forward and saluted, al-

though they could see by theiexpression of his face,
,and by the reluctant manner in which he gave the
Csalute, that it ill became his dignity to pay such re-
spect to a wandering quartet of gipsies. , V‘ _

. . VTheyi were received in silence, and condu'cted‘ in
_f'~_silence across the wide, paved courtyard’ that inter—‘
' vened between the high walls and the castle proper.

A’ lated all that had passed between him and the count;
and he added, when he had ﬁnished, and was smiling

. C at the horror he saw depicted on the faces of the two
;' , 'r1s:
‘ A. g1 “After, all, the scheme simpliﬁes all that we have got
. to do in a wonderful way; for the count -will himself
drug his men sufﬁciently so that they will sleep. We

 . will have our own horses to take us away, and will"

1/ not be obliged to travel several miles across the moun-
 ftain to the place where I arranged that horses should
_ be awaiting us; horses and ﬁve .men to help us out
of the country. When we get upon them, and are
ready to go, with the count as a prisoner with us, we
will cast oﬂ’ the packs and saddle—.ba‘gs,' with the gold
 and other stul-'f,'and there will be nothing to stop us.
A We will ride straight to the place where the ﬁve men
will be awaiting us——they are there by now——and our
mission will havebeen accomplished. Do you not see
it so?” -
They did, after they had recovered from the horror
of it, and it was decided to let the plan work out as it
would, everything being left to Patsy. . ,
It was not until ten o'clock that night that the count
, came for them. He did not send, as he had said he
‘ . would, and he explained the momenthe could draw
the supposed Tricio aside. ‘ V
“We are about the only peopleiwho a-re awake in
V A the whole castle,” he said. “The few who have not
,yet dropped asleep will _soon do so. There is one
 thing that I forgot, however. The portcullis is not
 Vdown, nor the drawbridge up. It will require the
combined strength of all three, of us to raise, the one
andlower the other.”

 ‘ “Then let us attend to it at once,” said Patsy. “Arla
I“? , and Zara -can wait in the-room where you received us
’ ,, this afternoon.‘ How about the gold, seﬁbr P”
’ “It is ready for you. Is Fernand in the secret?”
 ,_ .“Yes.”, t
f’  “And Zara?!’ ‘
' , . “Yes-J)
‘_‘B_ut Arla ” ~
“No, seﬁor; we must drug her‘ wine,' that you will
serve to" all of us in your room. ~\/Vhen she sleeps,
 Fernandand Zara and I will take our departure. If
 yougare not good to her, senor, and do not keep your
promises, I will return and I will:”
 ,“Bahl Never mind. what you will do. There
"shall be no occasion.” V
The portcullis was raised and the drawbridge was
t lowered by the combined efforts of the three men, the
f~‘count’s great strength supplying no mean portion of
 the effort. , A ‘ - ‘ -

V

-"".,scene of the afternoon had taken place the count
 begged them all to be seated around the table, and
» : then, with the remark, “There is no one to wait upon

he saw that same glass placed in front of Adelina;
but Adelina was in the secret, aswere also‘ the others,
and needed no warning. ,
When the count had ﬁlled the glasses, and was about", *
to take his seat at the table with them, Patsy exclaimed
suddenly: . 1" 
“What is that? I heard a noise, as if some One‘ .,
were in the corridor!” 
He rose instantly, and the count also turned toward «
the door; and, as he did so, Adelina, whose seat_was
next to the one he was to occupy, deftly exchanged
her own glass for his, so that, when he and Patsy V
returned from the door, the table looked exactly as ~,-A
he had left it. ,  , 'i ' ‘,
The party had not remained seated long after that ,1;
before the count began to show signs of drowsiness,
and Patsy, rising,’ passed behind him, and prepared
himself for action, for he_knew that in a moment the, ,_
count would be suspicious. — _
Suddenly Count Herbert’s head dropped forward, 4
but he raised it again by a mighty effort, and then, as’ . 
if he guessed the truth, that he had been drugged, he 
tried to start to his feet. ' ' ' ,
But already Patsy’s hands were at his .throat_, 
the count was pulled over backward to the ﬂoor; t  l 
The table was overturned and the chair broken in 
the severe struggle that followed, but Fritz lentiag ’'
hand, and the handcuffs which Patsy had provided for ,
the purpose were soon ﬁxed ﬁrmly upon the count’s" "
wrists.» The drug, too, was having its effect, and by 
the time he was well secured he was also asleep-un'-‘ '
conscious. , ' '_ VA  .1 , a~
' Half an hour latera party of ﬁve,,one of whom
