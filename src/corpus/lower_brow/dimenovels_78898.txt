wall, he discovered, when he alighted, that there was no
sign whatever of the men who had made the daring at-
, tack which had ended incarrying Joseph Chittenden
‘. away bodily. ~
I And there was no way for the detective to take up an
immediate pursuit.

There was no horse, not even a human being in sight

I anywhere. He stood in a roadway midway between two

I high walls, each ten feet in height, one surrounding the
grounds from which he had come, the other enclosing
other grounds of ' the same character, around another
_ mansion not unlike Seﬁora Del Puente’s. He could not
take up the pursuit for the reason that he had no means
of doing so, and he reﬂected bitterly that many minutes
must elapse before horses cold be brought from the
stables. /I ‘

Moreover, darkness was at hand.
(There is no twilight in that country, there being no
clouds to reﬂect the last rays of the sun over the land.

I It seems incredible to us who live in the north, and near

M. I the level of the sea, but there, on the tablelands of Mexi-

co,” a cloudy day is almost unknown.

’ The party engaged at croquet, which included Mr.

«Chittenden, with his son Hal and his daughter Rose, and
Senora Del’ Puente, were just making the last strokes of

_ _ their game when the attack was made which had ended

 so disastrously; and Nick, with his book, had drawn
closer to the window near which he had been reading, in

I order to be able to see the closing words of the chapter
2 he was ﬁnishing.

. Perceiving that there was not the slightestuse in re-
~nia‘ining where he was, or in following after the escaping
men on foot, Nick called out across the wall:

‘§Hello, Hal !”

lf‘Yes,._Mr. Carter?” V ,

8 ._f‘Ru'n to the stables and tell Primitivo to saddle three
of the seﬁorals best horses——one for each of us, for we
shall want him with us, I will go around to the front

g entrance and join you there. And, Hal!” I

 "f‘Yes?” . l

I ‘ g  ‘.‘There is no need for unnecessary haste. Themen
"have made good their escape for the present. We will
» have to trail them. Ask Rose and the -seﬁora to meet me

;, gatgthe front door.~”—- ' l
"—  .~“Al1 right, Mr. Carter.” .

° .5:  ’And.so the detective passed around to the frqnt of the

house while Hal Chittenden hurried away to carry out

I‘ ‘the directions that had been given him.

 

 

 

' is Nick found Rose and the seﬁora outwardly calm, al~'
; though both were pale and greatly startled by what had

    
    
 
  

fltappened. .He addressed himself to the seﬁ0ra.'
;._.“Please tell me exactly what happened,” he said;
I ‘.,‘,I'l_l1ardly:l<nowimyself,” she replied. ‘"Mr. Chittén-
was ‘rover’ inlthe game. ‘He had sent his ball the
ength of the ‘grounds, and it was over there near the

 s  

 
     

wall, close to the tree where you ‘got over. IW‘hen it
came his turn to play, he went to get it, and was leaning I
forward to’ take aim with his mallet when I saw ,
Miguel—-—-” ‘ ' ., I

“Miguel? Miguel Hernandez? The former admin-'
istrador of your hacienda in Michoacan ?”

“Yes. It was Miguel. I recognized him instantly.
Why not? I have known him all my life—-rever since I-
can remember he has served my family.”

“Go on, please.” ,

“I saw Miguel step out from among the foliage of the
tree where it tops the wall, and where he had evidently
been concealed until that instant.”

“Yes; go on.” ' L ~ ‘ .

“His riata was coiled in his hand, and, as he stepped
forward, he dropped the loop of it fairly over ]oseph’s
head and jerked it tight.

tenden to the top of the wall, ﬂung him over it out of
sight, and leaped after him. \ p
the same instant I did,'for she screamed at that time.” , '

“Yes,” said Rose. “I saw it all, just as you have de--I

scribed it, seﬁora; and I also recognized Miguel.”

As he 'did so, two other men , I.
appeared beside him, and together -they pulled Mr. Chit-. I

I think Rbse saw them at. ,

 

* “Evidently,” mused Nick alou‘d,~ “they knew that it I

was your habit to pass the last hours of daylight in‘ play-

ing croquet there in the garden. They made their plans

accordingly, seﬁora.” g _
“Mr. Carter, Miguel is familiar with every habit'I

have. He was in the sesvice of my father, at home‘ in 1

Madrid, before I was born. He has been a faithful serv-
ant all his life, and devoted to me until his z_eal_over-
stepped itself and he sought, to wreak, vengeance upon,

Mr. Chittenden for the wrong he believed Joseph hadlj V

done me thirty-three years ago.”*
Nick nodded. _, _
“Poor old Miguel,” continued the seﬁora. R" “He ’isjan
outcast now,‘but he brought it upon himself. i‘Neverthe-
less, Ihave no doubt that heattributes all his misfortunes
to Mr. Chittendenﬁ That "is why he has captured and

\,

carried him away. And,‘ Mr. Carter, I beseech you, lose‘ ’ I

no time in g0ing’t0 the rescue, for Miguelwill notysparef
where he hates.”  ' ‘ - ’

’ It was at that instant that Hal Chittenden, accom-I *

than two hours, and over trails where most horses would
consume twice that length of time.

“You, do not know which way they have gone from
here, ‘Primitivo ?” asked Nick.

“No, seﬁor, and it will be difficult to determine in this
light.”

‘Not for you, my friend,” said the detective.

‘Primitivo shrugged his -shoulders. Then he replied:

“For me, as well as for another, senor. The trail is
a rockyone now for a considerable distance, no matter
which one of three they took. I will try and see if I can
determine which. But we may have to wait here till day-

I After watering the horses,‘ and searching for and ﬁnd-
ing a spot where some grass grew upon which the ani-
mals could browse, Nick and Hal seated themselves to
await thehreturn of Prirnitivo.

It was an hour before he appeared, tireless, indefatiga-

ble, insistent. He was one man in ten thousand, Nick
. Carter whispered to Hal.

“Well, Primitivo?” he asked, as the latter dropped
down upon a rock near them and began the manufacture
of a corn-husk cigarette.

“It is useless, seﬁor,” was the reply. “I think I know
which way they have gone, but I am not sure. We must

I wait for more light.” .

_  ‘But surely we have gained upon them. They cannot

‘ “You know every one_ of” these trails, do you not, Prim-
itivo P” asked Hal. _

“As well, seﬁor, as you know the way in the dark to
your own lips with a glass of wine.” ;

“You think it .a better plan to wait here for daylight:
than to push on, do you?” ._ f

“I do, seﬁor. And if you and Seﬁor Carter will accept
my'advice, you will wrap those serapes around you and
get some sleep." It will be light enough for us to con- ‘
tinue on our way by four in the morning.”

They took his advice, it being good, and with the re~ ,
sult that both were soon soundly sleeping,-for the long,
hard ride through the night had brought‘ about a condition
of fatigue that was conducive to slumber. I

feeling the hand of Primitivo upon his shoulder. ,

“Come,” said the latter. “I have found the trail, and
the horses are rested.” , ‘ ' t .‘ ' i [2

Within ﬁve minutes they were in the saddle again and
pushing‘ on; and their way led them alonga narrow I
mountain-pass where the path was scarcely wider, than
two feet, and where the gulf beneath them seemed bot-
tomless._ e ' , - M

“It is the trail I thought they had taken,” said Primi-
tivo, speaking back over his shoulder; “but I was not; ‘I
certain. It is a short cut through this spur of the moun— , ,
tains, and‘ it is the route 'to Michoacanéto More1ia,,in A .

“Then it is evident that Miguel is..making for’ the
mountains near the hacienda that belongs to Seﬁora Del A
Puente—-the Hacienda 'del Montanas.” I ‘

“Yes, senor.” i- I

“As soon as we are certain. of that, Primitivo—-—”

“As soon as we. are certain of it, seﬁor, we will note I
bother to follow their trail, but will strike across by a A
shorter cut I know. It may be that we_ can get there

"“Wait,” said the detective as they were about to start
toward the prison house. “I think before we make that
effort, I will do a. little reconnoitering. Hal, yhu wait
here with Primitivo.”

“And I, seﬁor?” asked the Guerreran. “Pardon me,
but would it not be better for me to do the scouting for
you, since I know my way around so well?”

“No,’my friend. It is precisely because I do not know
it that I wish to ﬁnd out about it. It has never been to
my liking to work very much in the dark, so far as being
familiar with my surroundings is concerned. Wait here,

‘ both of you. I wdn’t be long.”

He glided away then into the shadow, and turned to-
ward ashedlike structure before which the brightest of
the fires was burning, and around which he could see
that a number of men were gathered.

' The detective himself was wearing a charro costume——
the one he had used in riding the‘ afternoon of his de-
parture from Coyocan; and on his head he had placed
Primitivo’s sombrero at the last instant" before leaving
him, so in appearance he was not dissimilar to the men

T who belonged at the place, if one should chance to see

I him, save that perhaps his dress was richer and better.

‘He kept in the shadow of the buildings as much as

i .possible as he moved forward, and presently was pleased

to discover that he had succeeded in approaching near

I enough so that he could not only see the faces hf the men

—a1“.0un(l the ﬁre, but he could quite plainly hear the words

= For a moment he paid no attention to what they were
saying, but busied himself in studying their hard faces;
all the time he was searching for the visage of old
‘Miguel. ‘ . .

 It was nowhere to ‘be seen, however, and then, just as
he’ decided that he would have to look elsewhere for the
bandit chief, he overheard a remark that astonished him.

4 ” Translated, it was as follows:

"Miguel should be here by now with the second party;

I eh, Pancho?”
pp “He should have been here before dark, if he met them
as'he hoped to do, and if nothing happened to spoil the

,  plans he made,” was the rather surly reply.

5, “And the old Eng1ishman—-—he is rich, no?”
I “As rich as an old'Spanish mine.”
‘ “And theyoung woman——she is beautiful?”
“As beautiful as a dream of heaven; with hair like spun
gold,,with eyes as blue as the sky at midday, with the
ﬁgureof a goddess——_— Ah!”

 f “It was «a master plot of Miguel’s; eh, my Pancho?”

 

‘ 'yrrYes n p

when the old man was captured, and then to descend ’

upon it when it had no protectors, and secure the girl.

It was great. Old Miguel has a head on him. He is

worthy to be our chief ;‘ eh ?”

“Yes.”

“Ca.ramZ7a! But it was a hard ride through the moun-
tains to’ keep ahead of those pursuers. I wonder where
we lost them?”

“Quien sabe, Sus. But they will never ﬁnd this place,
and if they should, much good it will do them l”

He who was called Sus laughed heartily over some
thought that occurred to him. Then he said:

“I was laughing to think what Miguel would do‘ to
the members of the second party if they failed to get the
girl. Plainly he was anxious, or he,would not have
gone back on the trail to meet them, so soon after his
arrival. The old man is like iron. For myself, I pre-
ferred to take it easy and await their arrival here—with
a full stomach. Did you hear what the old man said
when we dumped him on the ﬂoor in our Belem? But I
am forgetting. You do not understand the Engliph.” ‘

‘_'No; what did he say?” ‘ .

“He called out: ‘I am rich; very rich»; I will pay you
men well if you will releasane and take me back again l’
He was almost dead with the ride. I suspect he thought
that every bone in his body was broken.” I

“Doubtless.” '

“Will Miguel let him redeem himself, do you think, _, A

Pancho? ‘He hates him so that sometimes I doubt it.”
“He will let him redeem himself——yes. But the girl?

No. That, is to be his revenge“. And,‘mind you, the }old

man is not to know that the girl is here.

his ransom and has returned to Mexico. It.is theln~tha.t
he will ﬁnd it out. That is Miguel’s revenge.”

— “Ah, it is beautiful, isn’t it. Miguel knows how to
make his enemies suffer,
me about the dice?” 1

“True? Yes, as true as the gospels ;” and the scoun4
drel crossed himself devoutly, or, rather, superstitiously.

“Tell me again, that I may understandabout it.”

“It is this way; it was'Miguel’s ownproposal, for he

says he isftoo old.to want a wife.” A I I

“Yes. Well?” ‘
“The padre from the little church just outside of

Morelia is to be brought here blindfolded. He will be?
told that it is only to perform a marriage ceremony, and, 1
need ‘ ,

then he will be taken back again, so the good man
not be frightened.”
“Yes.”

“Then those of us who care to enter into the game are‘
to pledge one hundred pesos each for a chance at ‘the
dice. Then we are to throw, threetimes each, and he’. . .
who counts the most: for his three throws wins thegirl, .

and the padre will marry 't_he_m.”

 

He is not to ‘f

pended upon a very slender thread at that moment.

But she m'ade no sound. She only stood there facing
him in the darkness; and instantly it occurred to Nick
that she must have seen him and have known that he was
near, even before she had her conversation with Pancho.

“If she did not give the alarm then, she will not do so
now,” was his thought; and he folded his arms across his
chest and stood before her, waiting.

'“" Presently, as she did not seem inclined to speak, he
broke the silence, and inva low tone that could not pos-
sibly penetrate beyond her, he said:

“Are we to be friends, seﬁorita, or foes? Are you to

vsacriﬁce my life, and the lives of many of those me

whom I will kill before they can kill me P” ‘

"Bah!” she said; and smiled, showing her white and
even, teeth through the darkness. “It would please me
if you could kill them all, senor, and so prevail ‘upon my
father to take me away from here. How did you get
here?”

“I borrowed the wings of an eagle, seﬁorita, and flew
over the tops of the mountains,” he replied, returning her
‘smile. And she smiled again at this. A

“I can almost believe you,” she said. “I saw you

. there, in the shadow of (the house, when I came down to

hear what the men were talking about. I suspected
something of the kind that we overheard, when I knew
that my father had gone away again to meet the other
party. Again, how did you get here?”
I “I have told y0u—or nearly so. I climbed down the
faceof the cliff into the valley.”

“But it is impossible.“ ,

“Nevertheless, it is true.”

“Are you alone?”

.‘‘Before I reply to that question, seﬁorita, will you in-
form ‘me if we are to be friends?” I

“We may be friends if you will promise me to save
my father from himself, and in spite of himself.”

a A “And your father is Miguel ~Montez ?”

“Yes.” .1 I

p. ” . "1 will do what I can, but it is,asking me much. It
,' H ‘seems to me that I am in need of some saving myself at

the present moment.” _
 “Listen. You have come here to save the young lady

“Yes.”
_. .“Is ‘she the same ‘one who was a prisoner at the Ha-

“Yes.” '

“You are here to save them both, if you can?”

“I am here to save them both, and I can,” he replied, ,
shutting his lips together. _

Eulalia took a step nearer to him and peered into his
face closely. Then she gasped-. "

“I know you now,” she said.‘ “You are the same one,
,«who came to the hacienda, and rescued the young lady
‘and her brother when they were prisoners of my father
there. I saw you.” I

“Yes. I am the same, seﬁorita.”**

“You are Senor Carter.” , ,

“Yes.”

V -“You are a brave man to venture here. Are you
alone?” I
“You have not replied to my question yet, sefzorita.”

“I will be your friend and aid you, if you will in re-
turn help  seﬁor.”

“Is that a compact, iseiiorita ?”* '

“Yes”; if you will make it so.”

“There ispmy hand upon it. Will you take it?" And;
Nick stepped forward ’a little, extending his right hand;
and Eulalia placed her own slender palm within it and
looked up smilingly into his face.

“We are conspirators now,” she said.

“Yes. So it would seem, seﬁorita.”

v “And I am a traitor." ' ~.

“N o ; you are a brave and good young lady; who would
stand between another girl like yourself and wrong.
You are not a traitor, you are a pat.riot——‘Eu1alia.’’ '

“I like that better than seﬁorita. Indeed, why should-
I not savh her? I could not have those brutes of men
throw dice for her.” i :

“Certainly not.” 

“Are you alone, Senor Carter? Did ydu come here
alone?” p I

“No; there are two others with me. One of them is
the brother of the young lady whom your father is bring- ' I
ing here; the other——-”

“That handsome young man?” J‘ 3 I .

“Yes,” smiled Nick. “And the other is my guide, a
Guerreran named Primitive.”

“Where are they now?” ' . M ,

“Yonder in the shadow of that cluster of bushes ;”7and ’
he pointed toward them. “Theyare awaiting my ‘return _
and no doubt wondering why I have been gone so'l6nlg 
a time.” , ‘~ I. r  A

NEW Nick CARTER WEEKLY. ‘  ;

“N 0. Return to young Chittenden; and keep your eye
out for that food Eulalia is to bring to us. Welall need
it.” V L '

"Si, se'Fi0r,"’ and he was gone. it

For a little while the detective remained where he was,
"He
could see that the expected party had not arrived in the

bending his attention upon getting his bearings.

valley as yet, but he couldalso tell that the members of
it were momentarily expected.
Doubtless they had passed the outer guard on the

mountain, and the fact of their coming had been signaled.

ahead. That would account for the shouting.
Nick had no doubt that the information he had heard
discussed between Pancho and Sus had been whispered

about from lip to ear among all the men, until every one ,
' knew that a beautiful girl was to be brought there.

But now" the detective‘ felt less misgivings than when

was only himself and two others to depend upon to res-
cue her and her father; but now; in Eulalia, he felt that
he had a’ host; a host in the fact that they were already
safely concealed inside the house where Rose would be
conﬁned, and they possessed secrets of the place which
even the bandits themselves did not know. /

While he watched and waited, anothsr shout went up.
A pistol-shot rang out, and then another and another,

and then through the starlight he could see several horse- .

men ridevinto the valley from the mountain trail.
Among them, too, he saw the ﬁgure of a woman, and
he had no doubt that it was Rose. T
He wished with all his heart that there was some way
in which he could make it known to her he ‘was there
watching, and prepared to defend andrescue her; but

u . that was impossible.

i“And,'anyhow,” he thought, “she will know that we
cannot be very‘-far "on. She will have faith in us, and
Rose is not one to be easily frightened.” .

He went forward cautiously to obtain a betterposition
to see and hear, and presently arrived at almost the same
spot frofn which he had listened to the conversation be-
tween Pancho and fSus; but he took care this time to

"conceal himself better,‘so that if another should come‘
, upon himias Eulalia had done, he would not againbe
‘ discovered. ‘

Old Miguel and his men rode into the circle of light

~ cast by thegﬁre, and threw themselyes outiof their sads
Xdles.

Then there i

‘as she complied; and the two girls walked away together -

   

Theﬁre had been plentifully ceplenished, and nowit  ‘
cast 2. brilliant glare ‘over the scene, and for many yards . ”
around where they stood. V H _‘ .

Other hands ‘seized the horses and led them away, 
it was old Miguel himself who stepped forward and 5 ' '
lifted Rose from the saddle to the ground.  _

She was so exhausted that she could barely .stand;,l
Nick saw that plainly, and yet she preserved a digniﬁed
silence and glanced with more scorn than fear in her eyes,
upon thehard and forbidding and swarthy faces that suit— M
rounded her. i . .  , M

It was at "this instant that Eulalia stepped into the i_:‘_i
circle of light and went directly to Rose._ Then ishe '
turned and, facing her father, said inva quiet voice:

“My father, I will take charge of this prisoner. She“
shall come with me.” >

He noddedhis head and waved his hand toward the '
house he called. his own, h

“Take her away,” he said. , “She is hungry; give her’ , A
food. She is tired; give her rest.” T ,

“Espera mt momentito, j;/‘e”——wait one little minute," 
chief——a voice called out, and Pancho slouched forward [ « ’,,i
somewhat sullenly. “It is not fair that the young lady’  «V
should be taken away until we have a chance to see her,'”» it  _
and.I—————” T g _  “*9 

A gun as big as any that her father .ca'rried suddenly
appeared in the hand of Eulalia, and Pancho found him- »; T

S self looking directly into the muzzle of it.

“Stand back, Pancho,” she said. quietly, “or there will  V
be one less member of the company. Stand back instant“ p ‘it; 

1
. . ; 1'

1y, or I will ﬁre.” , . . _
He evidently saw that she meant what sheipsaidp, for 
fell back without another word, and Eulalia withoutit_ls,o,§i?
much as another glance toward him, turned and’t.0bkti.
Rose by the hand. i ' , 
“Come with me, and have no fear,” she whispered.‘ V.  V3,

  
 
   
 
   
 
 
   

A bright ﬂush of pleasure stole into the face of 

toward the house, without even a murmur of di§appro,v:al.~§,.
following after them; and even old Miguel‘ gazed after,_»
his daughter with pride glistening in his eyes. _ _ 1 

A The whole assemblage watched the pair in utter sileiice
until they entered the chief’s house, and then sotnethingv ';
like a sigh of relief escaped many of them. y‘It was as

They found Hal and Primitivo seated around a rude

’ table whereon a plentifulsupply of food had been placed,
, for Eulalia had not forgotten them, and there was more

'' than sufficient for all their needs.

We will pass over the greetings between father and
son. As for Nick, he. lost no time in helping himself to
some of the food that was there, for he stood greatly in

, need of it; but when he had eaten, and had found a cigar

in one of his pockets, be seated himself with his back

“I haven’t the least doubt of it,” replied the detective.
“Tell ps about your capture, and your journey here, Mr.

“My ‘capture was a strange thing. I remember that I
had just bent forward with my croquet-mallet in hand to
take aim, when it seemed as if I were seized from behind.

“And then———e—”

that if I made the slightest outcry, or attemptedto escape,

NEW NICK CARTERWEIEKLY. I A V 1

“There was a young woman who came to me_ aftertl
was cast into my prison house, and I owe my present
condition largely to her ministrations.” _

Then Nick told him about Eulalia, and what she had
done for them. As yet, however, he had said nothing
about the arrival there of Rose; but now he believed it
to be time to take theothers into his conﬁdence, and, as
directly as possible, he told them all that had occurred.

“And those fiends returned, after they captured me,
to make a prisoner of my daughter? Of my Rose?” ex-
claimed Chittenden. “Ah! Mr. Carter, what would
we have done without you?” I

_ “I think, at the present moment, it is more pertinent
to ask what any of us would have done without Eu-
lalia,” replied Nick, smiling. “Hark! What is that?” _

They listened, and could plainly hear a slight tapping

on the-stones over their heads/and Primitivo rose hastily‘

and went to the stone stairs.

“It is Eulalia come to talk with us,” he said; and with:
out waiting for permission, he raisedthe ﬂagstone from
its place. I '

She descended among them at once, and stopped,
greatly surprised, when she beheld Mr. Chittenden among
them. ’

“Was it wise to hasten matters?” she asked, turning _

toward the detective.

“I thought so,” he replied.~
it in my heart to keep him longer in ignorance of our

presence here, and when I got there, it never occurred to‘ ’

me to leave him. I brought him directlyihere.”

“But my father will know that some one has released ' -I

him. It will put him on his guard. And more; it will
make a demon of him, I fear.” ,

“I left everything,” replied the detective, “as if,‘Mr.
Chittenden had managed to free himself. I even made
it appear that he had forced the bar from its place across
the door. But, anyhow, I 'couldn’t leave him there, and

there is not one among them who suspect our presence A 

here.”
“N—no.” . - A
“And they ‘do not know of the existence of this place.
You had never heard about it, had you, Eulalia ?”_
‘‘No.’’» x  ,

_ “You did not suspect its presence here until your uncle
showed it to you, did you?” . ‘ 
“No.” ‘ . I i J

“Have they searched all the others?”

“Yes. All but this one. Open the door, unless you

“For what?” I

“Until Miss Chittenden makes herself presentable.”

A her already this morning.”

“But, my father, cannot one undress again after dress-

you—-—-unless in your impatience you break down the

They could hearlthe sound of talking in low tones out-
side the door at this, and the footsteps of men hastening
away. Then came the voice of Sus, who seemed to have
recovered from the choking he had received.

“Open, seﬁorita,” he called out. “Let us make sure

that thepman is not there. After that we will go away.‘

We have searched the rest of the house all but this one

That
is all there is about it.”

During this time the detective had not been idle.

His ﬁrst act was to rush to the windows and draw
the heavy, solid wooden shutters, so plunging it almost
in darkness. '

Then, remembering that thus far every secret passage-

: I ‘way that had been found had been entered by means of

raising a flat stone, he began an examination of the floor-
ing of the room.

Beginning at the center, as theimost likely place, he .

passed from stone to stone, trying to move each one with
his foot, trying to get the blade of This knife into the

‘ cracks between them.

23

It takes iime to accomplish this in a room that is‘
twenty feet square, and Nick began to realize that even
if such a secret place were there, :he mightmot have a?
chance to ﬁnd it. p ,

He began at the center, as has been said, and worked
backward from there to the door at which Eulalia was
parleying with the men, crossing from side to side and
trying every stone he passed. .

‘But he discovered not one that gave any indication of
being movable. A

At last he returned to the place of beginning and be-
gan to work in the opposite direction, toward the north
wall of the room. , ~

It is one of the many ironies of fate that frequently,‘

when searching for, something, it is found only at the ,

very last. I have known men who, after starting. a
search, believed so in the superstition, that they would
stop and begin at the opposite ‘end. '

It is certain that in this case Nick-Carter discovered

what he sought only at the very tail-end of his search— ; i

it was the very last stone untried in the room, and when
he found that it was indeed movab1e~—well, he .W0ndered
if even now he was to be disappointed, and if he would
lift the stone from its place only to find solid earth be-
neath it. I i i

It was the square stone in the northeast corner of the '-
room. ' . ,
_ He pried one edge of it up with his knife, as he had

seen Primitivo do in the other case, and at last he got’

his fingers beneath the. edge of it, while both the girls _ 4 '4

stood beside him looking on.

Their hands were clasped together, and they were 3 i ,
bending forward eagerly when they saw at last that his? ,1 

search had been rewarded; and Eulalia uttered a.-little cry

of astonished joy when she saw the detective lift the ‘A 

stone from its place and thus reveal a cavity beneathfitl
where there were stone steps descending as in that other.
instance.‘ I

«Quick!» she exclaimed, «Get into it, Mr. (llarticr, no‘  I

matter where it leads. Hark!”

There was a heavy thump at the door just then, and

afterit a voice called out—*—it was the voice of~_Sus again,  -
and somehow Nick thoughtjthad a w sound of author-I

ity in it, too, and he called out to Eulalia: A

“Sefiorita, we have here a beam of heavy wood, Ur;-A f_  j‘::l
less, you open the door instantly,,we will force it. ,
