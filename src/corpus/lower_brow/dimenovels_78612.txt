ofa tiny alcohol—lamp which did not shed as much
light as the ﬂame of the match had done. '

A Then he pointed with his ﬁnger towardia spot in the
middle of the room, where Nick could see nothing at

, all, and having forced the lamp into Nick’s hand, blew

it out.’ . .

For a moment the detective stood exactly where he
was, in utter darkness; but after a moment he felt the
Chinaman’s hand on, his arm, and with it a pressure
that gently suggested that he was to get down prone
upon the ﬂoor. '

‘~ Then it occurred to the detective what the China.-'
man had“ meant when he pointed toward the middle of I
' the ﬂoor. There wasdoubtless a trap-door there.

He obeyed the pressure on his arm, and got down,
ﬁrstion his hands and knees, and then as the pressure
continued, ﬁat upon his stomach. ‘

Then, with avsuddenness that startled him, voices
suddenly sounded.___A’c1early to him, ‘proceeding from" a
point directly in front of him. A -

He reached put one hand tentatively and ipresentl
discovered that a small square, not more than four
inches across’ it,‘ had been removedffrom the ﬂooring,
and that the sound of voices had come to him from} the
room beneath them. ' ‘ , A

AHe was saying: - _ 
“I do not think it will benefit us to wait anylonger 1- ..~_~<_

me that he will not come. It is plain that he did not

should appear later, well and good. If not, we must‘
consider some other and better means of getting Nick
Carter into our power before we separate for the night.
What say you all?” ‘  ‘ .
Nick realized fully then that the Chinaman, without 3
in the least understanding the fact, had saviedt ‘his,-
life, for if he had followed out hisorigirial*Ainte'ntion‘f
and gone to that meeting, it _is certain that he would."
have been killed as soon as he was inside the doom-'

But now, thanks to his knowledge of Chinese, and,
the AChin‘e‘se character, he was attendingtthe anarchist-
meeting without actually being present ;; or possiblyit 
would be more correct to say’ that he was present at"
the meeting without attending it. A A '5,

 there was not one among them who didinot wear a’

wig and some sort of false beard to shield his face.

This was doubtless done, Nick thought, in order
thateven the Chinaman through whose laundry they
were obliged to pass might not be able to recognize
them afterward.  é

s Of the ﬁfteen persons three were women, and these
wore half—masks so thatinothing of the features be-

hind them was visible. I / x

 The proceedings were carried on rapidly after the

lamps were lighted.

The man whose voice proclaimed him to be the
leader, and who was thevery man whom Nick had
followed from the house in Twenty—seventh Street,
prepared the bag with the beans, and having shaken
them up thoroughly he passed among his companions
permitting each one to put his hand inside the bag
and draw a bean. » '

It was the fourth man to whom he offered the bag, '
who drew the black bean, and he instantly announced
the fact; and his voice proclaimed him to be the man

‘ who had called for an explanation of the plans he-
. cause he had not beenpresent at the other gathering.

.1 near the rail astern, watching the imperiled men, with
t pale face and clasped hands. Her long hair, blown loose

" by the wind, hung infthick masses below her waist; she

looked the very picture of terror and anxiety.

 On swept the ship with the speed of a rocket, neither

‘swinging to larboard or starboard. There was a crack-

 
   
  
  
    
   
 

 stoven by the vessel’s huge bows, was never seen again.

V "and! a low scream from Grace, who, with hands over her
eyes, rushed into the cabin, as ifntojshut out from her

by that merciless ship. _ ‘

,The stateroom was empty, and the girl, staggerlng t0
‘a seat near the cabin windows, gave full vent to her feel:
A wings of anguish. ' _ '= 6

.. “All were lost——lost-—~lostl” she muttered. “Oh, my

God, howterrible!” "
.' t Then she pictured to herself the manly form and
%handsome face of Tom Bunk, whom with softest eyes
"she hadiwatched while he worked below ortaloftg she
‘ ’ pictured his body, being rolled along under the dark
keel of the tempest-driven ship. As this thought entered
K her mind she fancied she heard a faint cry.

“Help, help, help!” i _ 

. . She rose quickly. She threw her dark hair back from
her ears, and with neck arched like an antelope’s listened

” A intently.

- “Help, help, help!” .

 The voice seemed to come from the air close to her

ears; she thought she recognized the voice of Tom Bunk,

and a feeling of superstitious terror took possession of

.her.  .

“Help, quick, for Heaven’s sake! '

This time the voice ‘was louder than ‘before, and now

‘peering out, discovered Tom Bunk clinging to a short
grope, adependingyfrom a ring--about twoifeet, beneath the
vwiindow. He was not ‘alone, for‘ before being run down
he had lashed his brother to him with pieces of ratline
_ stuff, and these lashings still holding, the boywas closely
V unitedto hislbrave young relative. »

:. “Thank God!” cried Tom, as the girl’s beautiful face
. appeared above him.’ “Thank God! quick, Miss Grace,
please throw me a rope,” , . ’ '

NEW NICK CARTER ‘WEEKLY.

A sudden thought had ﬂashed across her mind. She 
pulled‘ her scissors from her pocket, and, quick as lights;
ning, severed one of the long, thick locks of hershining
hair. Twisting this with almost inconceivable rapidity,’
she lowered it to the young sailor, taking a turn with the
other end around a spike near the top of the window, so  I
asto keep a ﬁrm hold. .

“You have saved me and my brother, miss!” shouted.
Tom gladly, as he wound the glittering coil around his 
wrist. “Ah, who but one of your.s‘weet sex‘ would have
hit upon such a plan!” E  A ‘

He drew himself u’p—-—he entered the cabin, and laid
upon a sofa his senseless brother, who was soon re,~ ‘
stored.

I have little more to add. , V . ‘

There was rejoicing over the rescue of the brothers,‘
although the fate of the ‘rest of the boat’s crew still cast r
a shadow over all hearts. A i V ' . ~- - , g

The noble conduct of Grace Worrel excited the ‘admi-

t ration of every man, and her health was drunk by oﬁicers“

and crew. . V i V V
Tom and the fair passenger became great friends, and 
in course of time were married.” Now,'whenever the
husband kisses the bright hair upon his wife’s head, he
thinks of the time when herbeautiful locks were the
means of saving the lives.-of hisbrother and, himself. '
