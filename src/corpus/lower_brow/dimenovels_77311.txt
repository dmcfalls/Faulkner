“How much?” inquired Nick, feeling
in his pocket. V A

Just then a‘ passing newsboy halted
with a noisy bail to Tom and a stare all
around. ‘ .

.“It’s usually ﬁve cents,” vouchsafed
Tom, “but that’s a dime job if ever there
was one. You see, I’m out for all I can
make to-day----”

“Wcll, do we call it a dime then?"
smiled Nick.

“Yes-—uo-_-—say! it's nothing to you--
not a red cent.” .

“E11 5” 7
M Nick looked askance at Tom. A little
by-play had escaped even his shrewd no-
tice.

The boy who had just come up had
whispered a quick word in¢'1‘om’s car.

“Know who you‘re shining?”

“No,” said Tom. T

“Nick Carter. ” .A
, “Whatl" gulped Tom, under his
breath, and with a stare of awe. . e

“Nothing to me ?” spoke Nick. “How ii
is that?” ' -

Tom took oﬁ his cap, looking excited i
rather than embarrased. Thenlhe said. 2

expression of his face, but it glowed mo-
mentarily and he could not help it.

The great detective had stood in court,

‘ the victor in some wonderful contents of
law against crime, the cynosure of hun-
dreds of eyes, and had preserved his coun-
tenance as if it were a mask.

He had listened to the ardent praise of
‘judge and jurist time and again, without
moving a muscle to indicate ﬁat he was
aﬁected.

Never, however, had he felt more
pleased than by the mute, honest admira-
tion of the four grimed faces regarding
him devoutly, as if he was some modern
Napoleon. '

“That’s all right,” he said, lightly.

“You tell little Blind Billy so, and give
him this for me.”'
Nick extended a bank-note and started
to leave the chair. * 7
“No, you don’tl" dissented Tom,
strenuously, putting his hands behind
is him-—“don’t you go to spoil onr——our
' pleasure with. oﬁering pay for anything
‘ weican do for you. ”
“Well, I declare!” muttered Nick.
-“Here's diamonds in the rough worth
A_ polishing. Thank you, Tom. I shall ﬁnd
W a way to see little Billy again in a few
' days." . ‘
V Nick started off, swallowing a trouble-
some lump in his throat. He was deeply
. touched, andpdid not try to hide the fact
from himself.“

He employed one of those deft back-
ward glances of his to take in unsuspected
the coterie of four, standing like statues,
everentially gazing after him. Then with
afsltart the halted, andwith a sharp ques-

much do you make a day selling papers?”

“It varies, Mr. Carter.”

“Well, what is the average?”

“Seventy-ﬁve cents, maybe.”

“What would you say to two dollars?”

“Regular ?”

“For a month at least."

“What doing?”

“Oh—in my line.”

Tom looked ‘ positively scared. If a
major general had suddenly put a col-
onel’sepau1ettes on his shoulders he could
not have been more stunned.

“Say!” he gasped, “you’re joking?”

“Will you take the contract?”

“Won’t I !”

Torn’s eyes lit up as if there had sud-
denly been opened to him a vista of splen-
did acts leading up to a glorious career.

Then he actually turned pale, asif over-
whelmed at trying to realize that it was
all true. ’

“Come there at four o’clock this after-
noon,” spoke Nick, tendering a card
bearing his address.

‘He departed for good this time. Tom
sank to the chair he had vacated, a misty
maze over all about him. ’

“Bo_vs," he said, attempting a weakly
smile, “as they say in the play, ‘leaveme
to my thoughts.’ ”

And, as plain but ambitious Tom Daw-
son sat dreaming great dreams, building
wonderful air castles, recalling everything
he had ever heard, read or imagined
about the detective career, the news
spread like wildﬁre through the ranks of
New York-’s brightest, most thrifty throng
—-the never tiring newsboys: Tom Daw-
son had been taken under Nick Carter’s
wing, and was going to be a detective!

CHAPTER II.
A QUEER srorzv.

‘ Tom was at the door of Nick Carter’s
house on the tap of the bell. l

Never. perhaps had a more ﬂuttering

‘mortal passed its threshold, and never did

’ an unfortunate clerk, applying for work,

out at elbows and trying to convey an im-
pression of better days, patch up his
threadbare attire more diligently than
‘Tom had done. . ,

and homeless, and having secured board

and lodging for his charge in safer and

surer quarters, Tom- had sewed up his
ragged sleeve, had mended his tattered
cap, had brushed and» sponged, had
scrubbed face and hands, and polished his
gaping shoes till all three shone.

Nick's approving glance told that he
noticed this characteristic of neatness in
his new protege. In two minutes he had
Tom completely at his case.

‘_‘Don’t look scared, Tom,” he advised
indulgently. “This is business, square
and simple—so much work for so much
money.”

This practical statement, however, did
not one whit take the glamour of an-
ticipated detective experience out of
Tom’s ardent mind.

“And don’t look worried,” continued

-Nick. “I‘ve picked you out for work you

are just qualiﬁed to do, and which you
will do well just for that reason. ”

“Thank you,” murmured the gratiﬁed
Tom.

I “You are young, but you have in a
way seen more of life than the majority
of men double your age,” pursued Nick.
“I would trust to your guess on a man’s
face, I would rely on your- covering

ground quick and thorough in case of a
. surgency, I would bank on your native

shrewdness, caution and energy every

time, as against that of some-of the so-

‘called professional students of humanity
who skim the surface and never guess
what lies beneath. "

(‘Lots  7!

“Correct, and your knowledge of the
shady ways of ,shady men is going to
Tom,
I am going to put you on a case.” .

If Nick had told Tom he was going to
puthim on the directory board of a bank,

V'I‘on1 could no have looked prouder.

“It will take a month of your time, and

- I shall give you in advance half your
~month’s salary. With that, get your little
blind charge safely bestowed‘ somewhere. ”,

“I've done that already,” prompted

 Tom, quickly. ‘

“Yes, sir,” ﬂuttered Tom.

I shall give you

“One order, which is the Alpha and.

the Omega, the beginning and the end,
the start an_d the ﬁnish, the essence of
shadowing and the incentive to nabbing
the game in sight.”

“What’ that, sir?”

“ ‘Wat that man!’ ”

Nick was enunciating a broad principle
of detective science only, but he spoke
with such impressiveness that Tom stared
around in a startled way.

“I don’t see any man——” he began.

“Oh, he isn't here; I am simply sink-
ing a few necessary facts into your mind.
The man in reality I shall show you
later.”

“And I am to watch him?”

“You -are to follow him.”

“Wherever he goes?”

“From morning till night you are to
behis shadow, his second self. ”

“I’ll try to.” .

“More than that, you must watch those
with whom he comes in contact—any
who seem to suspiciously follow him. In
fact, at stated intervals I want you to be
prepared to report to me, hour by hour
and step by step, what this man does to
the smallest detail. ”

Tom looked eager,
pressed.

“Do you think you can do that?” asked
Nick.

“I will do it!" declared Tom, posi-
tively.

“Very well. Now, listen closely.”

Nick paused for a moment, as if he was
mentally arranginga series of facts which
he wished to make very plain to his
young pupil.‘ .

These facts he proceeded to arrange
with a simplicity and clearness that a
child could take in.

“The man you are to watch," he be-
gan, “is not a criminal.”

i“‘Oh !” murmured Tom, and he looked
a triﬂe disappointed.

“He is, rather, a victim. It is a pecu-
liar case. What lies under itldo not
know, he does not know. What gives

“All right for a watchman, though,”

letdown from his high aspirations for
‘him to endure silently.
_ “Say l” he spoke, ﬂaring up a little,

‘ ‘ Carter, who can do anything he likes with

 At that moment Nick re-entered the

a were soon on the street.
. During a rapid walk of nearly a mile,

he talked conﬁdentially to his new pro-
tege, and Tom drank in the points with

bustling metropolis, the sound, ominous
and peculiar, rang out.

To the momentarily halted onlookers
the crashing echo signiﬁed an every-day
accident, to the person nearest to its
source, “a narrow graze," but to a boy
on the opposite side of the street, Tom
Dawson, it announced clearly, unmistak-
ably “the ﬁrst shot” in his ﬁrst detective
case.

This is what had happened:

Sandoval, king of Norona, and victim
of some mysterious menace, leaving the
store where Nick‘ Carter had placed Tom
on guard, had proceeded toward his hotel.

The route he took must have been a
customary one, for, passing a high partly
occupied building, there suddenly hurtled
from its fourth story a missile, a projec-
tile, a descending mass surely intended to
crush out his life at,one dread blow.

To passers—by glancing up after the
thing was over, it looked as if a large
iron box ﬁlled with dirt and planted with
vines had broken away from the rusted
wires holding it in place on some window
sill.

The minute, however, that Tom’s quick
eyes caught sight of the descending object,
he caught‘ as well a ﬂashing view of the
hand that had started it on its tragic
journey. -

The box came whirling down with
frightful velocity. It so closely grazed the

petriﬁed Sandoval that his hat was blown ’ i

from his head.

It crashed to fragments so near to him
that one piece of the thin, brittle metal
shied obliquely, grazed his hand and tore
a deep gash clear across his ﬁngers.

A woman screamed, another fainted, a
policeman ran up. In twenty seconds
Sandoval was the centre of a gaping,
questioning throng. ,

What had happened ? Was he hurt?
How did t e box come to fall?

“I don’t now,” voiced Sandoval, pale
and shaking. “0i‘ﬁcer,_I am quite-quite
unnerved. Will you kindly call a cab?”

“I will. Your address ﬁrst, sir. Card?
Thank you. Necessary in case—those
careless people up above get too indepen-
dent, and won’t agree to be more careful.
May have to prosecute them. Hey, ‘
cabbyl” . .

" Whoa! Flip! Slam !—quicker than 

  

i had counted, Tom saw Sandoval en-
conoed in a cab, and whirled away before
he could make a move.

. He could not “hitch behind” with a
gaping crowd surrounding. He braced
himself for a keen run. '1‘-hen Torn paused.
He rapidly went over Nick Carter‘s ex»
». plicit instructions-——to not only watch this
' inan, Sandoval, but as well to keep track
of those who followed or inenaced him.
The policeman was expatiating on the
perils of housewives .usingi window sills
for staterooms, ~was taking down the
number of the building preparatory to a
report and later tardy investigation.
, l “We’ll make a warning case of this
' ’* , here accident,” he stated, oracularly.
» 1 “It was no accident!" murmured Tom,
. impressively. “Shot at two nights ago,

gether to crush the life out of another fel-
low creature.

“Why ?" he interrogated himself, and
then he added, quickly: “It's no time to
dawdle asking idle questions. My duty is g
to see that Sandoval comes to no harm-— ~e
the present point what is best for me to ’
do just now ?”~ ‘ M

Tom rubbed his head thoughtfully. ;
He fancied he must be a pretty poor 
apology for a detective, for he wavered 
ii-resolutely between a notion of scouring -{F
the building whence the box had fallen,
informing the oﬂicer of what he had seen . ,
and having the place surrounded, and 
trying to catch up with the. cab which ’ _
was just gliding around a corner three ~ ‘ ‘
squares away. \

“It’s too much for me," he declared, ,
starting forward. “I'd have tobein three
or four places at once to do what comes
to me to _do. I can’t follow the woman
and the man, too. She’s vanished, he's.
at the hotel where he lives, so I guess the
nearest I can come to Mr. Carter's idea
would be to go there and look out for the

 
   
    
    

Tom gave a longing look back at the

   

of the affair seemed to lure him in that” .4
direction solely. ' ._ '

Then, setting feet and eyes directly
contrary, he madea sharp sprint, lessened V
it to a dragging gait, and prickcd up his
ears. g

“Keep always on the lookout for sus-
picious and mysterious happenings around
a place where action centres,” Nick Car-j
ter had laid down to Tom.‘ as one of his ‘ 
most valuable rules that afternoon. “You, i

’ .
’ But this he did, ..and more than this.
As if some deﬁnite point was settled in
hisgmind by the inspection he had made,
he now did a strange, and unusual thing.

He carried a cane in his hand. This he
suddenly reversed. v ,

Its lower ferrule was a hollow steel cap.

Taking from his pocket a thin round
= piece of chalk, he exactly ﬁtted it into
-the tube so that an inch or two projected.

Reversing his cane, with another keen
look down the street, he started briskly
away. ‘ . -

“What’s he up to, anyway?” reﬂected
Tom, puzzled.

' “What’s’he doing that for?” followed
a prompt second curious query.

Keeping to the extreme edge of the
7,sidewalk, the man carried his cane like
 any other promenader—swung it, brought
"it occasionally down on the smooth pave-
xneut. .

a Only, every time he did this, his hand
described a swift, deft twirl. -

And every time he its chalk-loaded
point, the wondering Torn saw that he
had made a deﬁnite, uniform mark.

. “Say!” blurted Tom, and that was the
‘ best way he could express his emotions.
Here was something directly in line with
. what Nick Carter had described as “sus-
picions and mysterious. ”

_, Had it any connection ‘with the San-
“flidoval case? If the man’s look down the
street told anything—possibly.

, On such slight encouragement had
Tom -any business to turn from the
straight clear task of watching Sandoval?

:l,Perhaps—-the latter was safe, for the pres-

,.ent, at least, at his hotel. .

~ “I‘ll see what comes of- it,” decided

“Tom. “That man is not making those

marks for fun. 'I‘here’s too many of them

 for that. ” T,

‘ 7 Tom started after him. He could have

followed the man without even looking at

NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

After, going about three squares, the
man began to get nearer the inner edge
of the sidewalk.

Suddenly he whirled,‘shot a piercing
glance back of him, describing a sudden
movement with his cane in front of him,
and-—vanished.

Tom was some distance from him as he
executed these maneuvres; several pedes-
trians, too, blocked a perfect view.

“Where’s he got to so suddenly ?” pro-
jected Tom.

Then he saw a great chalk mark crossed
a high_door-gate guarding a private en-
trance to a place with the sign, “Cafe,"
on its front.

“That’s where he went-—through that
doorway,” declared Tom. “Then he’s
waiting for somebody, I’ll bet. And then
again, maybe not. Through to another
street, for all I know. I’ll ﬁnd out. Here,
Chuck! give me them all. ”

After a quick glance along the_ street,
Tom, darted ahead to where a little
urchin was calling out an evening news-
paper. .

Too much of an expert was Tom no
to estimate at a glance the number the
little fellow carried under his arm.

“ Hello, Tom——-—” began the newsboy.

“Mum itis! There’s a quarter. Follow
your nose and don’t look at me‘. Ex-try!
Here’s your ex-try-full account of-
rumity-tum ity—disaster-- clicketty-clack-
etty people killed!”

Tom grabbed the papers from the star-
tled newsboy’s one hand, planked the
coin, in his other, and darted squarely for
the door with the chalk mark on it.

He was the bustling irrepressible
gainin complete-—not afraid to penetrate
anywhere with his sense-exciting scare-
voice and breathless manner. '

.. Back went the door with a slam, and
down four steps went Tom, seemingly
only a daring paper-seller, but his eyes
bored into every crack and corner like
gimlets. T .

There were not many. A straight
boarded-up space ran to an open side door
of the cafe.

The man with the chalk cane was no-
where in sight.

» “Is he in the cafe? Pmgoing to know.

place, into a dark rear room, Tom dove
boldly.

His ‘glance took in every object in sight
—a huge ice-box, chairs, tables, and

. seated at a shuttered window, looking as

if he was impatiently awaiting some one,
was the man he was after, just as he had
guessed.

“Get out of here !?’ roared the aproned
keeper of the place as Tom made a hurri-
cane dash clear to the street. . ‘

o In a ﬂash, once t_here,:.he whipped the

Through that gate-door just swung to

. after him, Tom dove.

A daring plan had come into his head.
Under the spur of the excitement of the
moment he put it into instant execution.

The man in the cafe was waiting to
meet somebody, and it could be no ordin-
ary appointment that he put that some-
body on his trail like Indians do their fel-
lows in the wild West, theorized the ex-
cited Tom.

That “somebody” would sooner or
later appear, would join the man in the
rear room of the (safe. a "

Of course they ‘would-talk, and to q_yer-
Tom‘ was satisﬁed, would
surely be to discover‘ something sinister
and interesting. A .

Way down in ’1‘om’s mind, too, there
was a hope, a bare hope, that this some-
thing might have some connection with
the box that had dropped so near to San-
doval. A '

For the man with the cane had in-
spected the building whence it had
hurtled with no casual interest.

“If I can only make it!” breathed
Toni, and he crept cautiously.»but swiftly
along the passageway down which he just

, He had noticed the big ice-box. The

the me-box a small ventilating aperture,

 screened with ﬁne wire, ‘which came with-
_.in.two.£eet of thertable at which the man

with the chalk cane sat. His back was to
Tom now.

“Can I make it?” ﬂuttered Tom. “Got
to!” he concluded, with a start, and
glided forward.

At that moment the street gate
slammed. The man at the table bent his
ear eagerly. '

Light, rapid footsteps echoed down the
passageway walk.

There was but one thing for Tom to
do, and he did it. '

He made a shadow-like dive. Through
the ice-box rear door he went.

A clammy chill cooled down his ardor
a triﬂe as he found himself in a zinc-lined
apartment.

He half drew the door shut after him.
Then he wormed. his way to the little
aperture covered with wire netting. He
could see through it against the light, he,
was directly at the elbow of the man he
had so cleverly shadowed hither.

Tom gave a low chuckle of satisfaction.
He was immensely pleased with the suc-
cess of his first detective exploit.

Then he bent his ear to listen——to lis-
ten to a conversation that was destined to
fairly make his hair rise.

 

CHAPTER IV.
“A'rcHroNl”
“Burr-rr!”
The minute Tom got quieted down he

made a discovery of discomfort that caused .

him to hope the interview about to take
place would be a short one.

It was cold in the icebox. ' The com-
partment he was in held nothing but sev-
eral rows of bottles on a metal shelf over-
head, but little gratings let in frigid
blasts from the real ice chambers.

Violent exercise had warmed him up
considerably, ‘and he felt the sudden
change of some forty degrees of tempera-
ture most vividly.

“Door open, netting hole right at my -

nose-—guess I won’t quite freeze, ” decided
Tom. “Oh, my! oh, my! oh, my!” '
All this Tom said to himself, butso

fervently that every nerve in his body i is

wriggled. _ ~

To use a common saying, he was 
“nearly tickled todeath," as what boy~in a

his place would not be!

For just, then there was an arrival. The .‘ 

   
    
  
  
   
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
    
  
  
   
   
   
     
   
   
 
  
  
   
   
  
      
  
    

man at the table got up to welcome the
same.

, * Then he sat down again, and there sat

' down with him the visitor who had lo-
cated him through the chalk marks.

. “It’s her!” Tom gasped, in one tre-
mendous triumphant gnlp. “Run down
the first crack out of the box!”

What would Nick Carter say to this—
the person who had attempted the life of
Sandoval located by his new assistant
within one hour after he had started him
on the case?

Tom’ peered through the little wire
‘netting with starting eyes.

He recognized the woman in a ﬂash.
Her face from whch she threw a thick
a veil, dark and tragic, he had only seen at
i la distance,.but the eyes, the dress, the
 ringed hand—he could swear positively

 . the box from the window sill which had
,, ‘so narrowly‘escaped making an end of
, Sandoval.

» “Now then!” muttered vTom, bestow-
 ‘, ing himself as comfortably as he could,
‘ and preparing to listen to whatever might
_ be spoken between the two at the table
’ not three feet away. »

But neither spoke. Their glances met.
, The'woman looked sullen, the man an-
- gry. Then the latter arose, went -to the
 a, front of the cafe, and shortly returned.
’ ' “Certainly no one shall interrupt you,”
.,_ ‘spoke the approved owner of the establish-
Tnieut, bustling after him. “I’ll ﬁx that. "-
He unloosed the curtains screening the
» oonnectingarchway. Then he closed and
‘l  locked the rear door, and then, inciden-
" tally passing the ,ice-box, he did some-
’; thing else that‘ took_ Tom’s breath away.
- « Noticing this open door, the man gave
"this a careless kick. Bang! it’ went shut
_; --click! went a snap, and Tom experi-
1  a dawning sensatibn of dismay.
E "~“Caged? I guess,” he ruminated.
'-»‘.!Well, we’ll attend to getting out when

 again; Left alone, the two at the
 got down to business.

“Wasn’t it?”

“Try it yourself, next time. ”

“Me? oh, dear, no!- I can hire too
many,” derided the man, with ashrug of
his shoulders.

“See here,” spoke the woman, rapidly
and forcibly, “I have tried to help you, I
have blindly followed your directions, but
I do so no longer if I am to be sneered
at.”

“You have had three chances.”

“Yes, shot twice. Try it on the public
streets, you, and see how quick a crowd
gathers! I barely escaped. ”-

“And tne knife thrusts?”

“Stupid as he was, Sandoval shouted.
I had to ﬂy.— As to the box——was it not a
clever scheme? I knew ‘he passed that
way nightly. Well, I failed again. What
have you to say next?”

The man bent his brows in an ugly,
knitted frown. Then he looked up, and
Tom fancied he had never seen a more
ferocious face.

“I say,” he announced-—“it must be
done!” ' i

“That means try again?”

“Not try, but do itl’.’

“Oh, there shall be no failure this
time!" laughed the woman.

“Conﬁdent, eh?”

“I am. So far, you have restricted me.
This Sandoval was to die an accidental
death. ” . .

“It was necessary to my scheme.”

“How would a mysterious death do?”

“You mean‘ poison? No, that would
not do. I want no post-mortems, no inves-
tigation. ’ "9

“There will be none. See here, Delos
Rankin," I can put this man out of the
way to-night, as he sleeps in his room, so
quickly, so surely, that all the doctors
and detectives in Christendom would
never guess what killed him.”

“What’s that!” muttered Tom, with a
vivid start. “Rankin? Why ”

He became lost in conjecture. Rankin!
That was the family name of the actress
Sandoval had married. I

Heretofore, Tom ’s theory about the at-
tempts on Sandoval’s life had been con-
ﬁned to the suspicion that some enemy
from his kingdom, some emissary of the
new insurrectionary party now in power

there, was bent on putting him out of the V

 strong.

sneezes.

He tried to smother them, he smiled
his handkerchief against his face, he
strangled himself with both hands, but it
was too late.

The alarm was given. Both Rankin
and his companion started to their feet.
The former looked puzzled, the latter
angry, at an interruption at a. vital
climax.

Rankin.

“Oh! a cat, I ‘suppose, or some other

“Yes, sir," called out the proprietor of

“No, no. I am not joking. We heard

“Some one where?”

“Inside of it.”

“I do.”

“Nonsense! Why, look for yourself,"
and the man opened the main glass door
of the refrigerator. Tom had stopped
sneezing. Now he began again.

rected Rankin. “Hear that! and that!"

tumbled in a heap to the ﬂoor, and before
he could‘ gain his feet and run was
grabbed by a powerful arm.
“Let me go!” cried Tom, vigorously.
“Yes, I will. What you doing in there,
r » anyway?”, ‘
 “l was-resting.”
 ‘ n “Blue blizzards! Look at that!”
The man caught a flashing. glimpse of
shattered bottles and trickling contents.
‘ He gave Toma shake. Then he looked
‘ again. Then he dragged him toward the
door, and Tom was a_ mere feather in the
grasp of a giant.”
Evidently, in his first wrathful out-
burst, the man was minded to deliver
‘Tom up to the nearest policeman. Just
nearing the archway, however, a voice
halted him:
“Brown!”
The man turned, and the helpless Tom
“ glanced backward, too.
At the side .door,. quite pale and dis-
turbed looking, was Rankin.
“Who is he?” was projected sus-
. _ piciously.  g . ,
I “Looks like a wharf rat, acts like a
thief. Planted there in the ice-box to rob

“Come on, you young sneak thief!”

Tom had given up active resistance.
He saw that it was useless, and only made
his captor’s iron ﬁngers twine more cruel-
ly, but he watched out for a chance to
trip up, slide or slip.

The opportunity for any such
maneuvre, however, was not allowed
him. To adoor the man dragged him,
opened it, pushed him before him down
some steps, and Tom found himself in a
close cellar about twenty feet square.

It had shelves for furniture only, and
these were loaded with row after row of
cobwebbed bottles.

“You cool off there, you destructive
rascal! , You ‘rest’ where I’ll ﬁnd you
when I want you,” observed the man.

He locked the door as he retired. Tom
was up those steps in a ﬂash. For a few
minutes he priedwith his ﬁngers, peeped
through the cracks.

“Double lock, bolt and chain,” he
ﬁnally guessed. “Well, if there’s no win-
dow below, I reckon I’m booked for a
free all-night berth.”

Tom groped around the dark cellar.
Except for two four-inch ventilating grat-

ings, there was not a break in the solid

stone wall.

He sat down to, reflect. The most tor-
menting question was what Nick Carter
would say to his taking an independent
course in following Rankin, and thereby’
getting into his present trouble.

There was a prospect of Tom remain-
ing a prisoner until morning, and by that
time the plot against King Sandoval
would have succeeded. .

“lt’s terrible to thirk of!" murmured
Tom. “All-the same, if I hadn’t got
clutched by that bruiser overhead, and
had got to Mr. Carter and warned San-
doval, what a howling success I’d have
been,‘orders or no orders! I reckon it’s
success only that counts, no matter how

accidental it comes. Oh, drat it! Cooped ~

up like a rat, and no help for it! I’ll dis-
cover away 1'’

Tom was aroused, for he was conscious 9

that all ‘his clever work of the past hour
would count for nothing. in theface of
ﬁnal disaster.

surer approach to death for the menaced
Sandoval.

And’ then, as he realized that he was
the only person in the world,_ probably,
who could help the beleaguered king, he
felt that he must do something, if it was
only to keep from thinking.

“I was foolish not to light, kick, yell,
drawa crowd up stairs there,” he de-
clared. “I could show up all right to
people or police. The man, Brown,
couldn’t, for he’s in with Rankin, in a
way, sure. Wish I was up stairs again!
Why, say! I'll get there!” '

Tom’s eyes snapped conﬁdently, and he

~ chuckled.

He moved over to a row of bottles, and,
groping, began to pile dozen or more
across one arm. ‘

“It comes high, but ,we can’t stop at
costliness!" he gloated. “My place is in
a police station if I’ve done wrong, not
cooped up in a private cellar. It’s an in-
fzingement of tyranny, so here goes! I’ll
bring that lunky iant down among his
dusty treasures, or know the reason why. ”

Tom drew back, poised a bottle in his

free hand,’ took blind aim, and let it‘

drive. Q
Whack-bang! ' -
It struck the door at the head of the

stairs. Back came a shower of glass.

ilfrickle-drip-drop echoed the mellow gur-

The cobwebbed recesses of the close

"cellar gave back a hundred startling
echoes.

 ‘Footsteps, heavy, hurried, sounded

overhead, a frantic groan, approaching a

. roar,‘ told Tom that he had succeeded in

arousing the lion at last.
The door opened at thetop of the stairs.

 Tom had light now to direct his aim.

tipped over twenty others with another
deft throw.

“See here, mister,” he called up, as
the man reached back of him and grabbed
up a heavy club, “don’t you come at me
with that. I’ll give you the next bottle if
you do!”

“Then stop!”

“I’ll stop when I get out of here—not
before. ”

“Get out of here? Yes, yes, you shall!
Come here!”

The man descended three steps.
he made a spring.

It was Tom’s intention to attempt to
dodge past him, but the man was too
quick for him. i

I-le fairly swooped on Tom, ﬂinging
him to the ground and falling on top of
him. ’

Then he struck at him wildly, jabbing
his head back on the hard stone ﬂoor,
beating his heavy ﬁsts into Tom's eyes,
slamming him, banging him, in a trans-
port of the wildest fury.

Tom was wholly stunned for a minute
by the ﬁerce onslaught, for he afterward
had no recollection of being carried up
the stairs.

His senses only partly returned as he
opened his eyes and saw that he was on
the main ﬂoor again, but he had not the
strength to call out as he had planned.

A bruised, wavering playthiug in the
hands of his powerful captor, Torn only
shuddered as he observed that near the
ice-box the man had lified a trap-door. '

A dark bole yawned. Into it the man
savagely ﬂung Tom, with the words:

“You couldn’t leave well enough alone,
eh ? Well, see if you like those quarters
any better 1".

Then

CHAPTER VI.
A BOLD BREAK.

If ’I‘om’s first prison place in the cafe
was gloomy, his second dungeon was
positively repellant. .

He landed with a shock on what he
found to be a heap of coal. Through the
trap, it seemed, the man had been in the
habit of sweeping all his refuse, and

lemon peel, cigar stubs, beer dregs and
. old vegetables littered the place and made "' V

the air reeking.

 

  
  

   
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
    
    
   
     
    
    
   
      
      
     
     
  

A It was fullyhalf an hour before Tom
. i found himself in any shape to move about.
The man had given him a dreadful beat-
L‘ ing, and his tumble into’ this vile‘ coal
. hole had not brightened him up any.
Asmuscles, wits and emotions got back
to normal, however, Tom displayed the
. usual vim of a genuine New York gamin
—-he got mad as a hatter. ' .
“P11 be even with that fellow’ if it
; ‘takes a year!” he muttered, “and I’ll nip

that he held the upper hand just now.

“You keep quiet if you’re wise," ad-
vised the man, making an arrnful of the
kindling and moving away. '

‘Tom bolted out the word, and his heart ‘
surged with sudden hope.

With glowing eye he noted the spot
where the man had just mt. '

The kindling cutter had left behind
him the short-handled ax he had been

Tom had offered’; to carry the woman's

hand-bag more to hide his embarrass-

To his surprise, she gave him a second
keen glance, and said:
“Very well, if you need the nickel, 1
will let you earn it." ‘
“Thank you, rna’ar'n," mumbled Tom.

move with-a rapidity that kept Tom's
head whirling. i

The woman Viola had promised Ran-
kin to remove Sandoval‘ from an earthly
sphere that night. _

What but a move looking to that end in
view could her presence at the hotel sig-
nifyg?

“She's on his track, hot and prompt,"
thought Tom. “My! she's a—-corker!
Pistols, knives, loaded ﬂower-boxes—what
next? Something doubly deadly this time.
She told Rankin so. Is ,it in the hand-
bag? If it is, it’s something alive. It’s
getting harrowing. Well, I’m at the right
place to ﬁnd out what, and at the right
time, that's sure."

newsboy attire. 1 ’

Suddenly they paused. From her
movements Tom could guess that the bit
had pierced the ﬁrst board, was probing
in the empty space between it and the
one three inches distant which ﬁtted to
the ﬂoor of Sandoval’s room.

The clairvoyant simply got a start on
the invisible board. Then she arose.

Tom followed her every movement,
fascinated.

She first drew from her pocket a little
instrument resenibing a ﬂute. ’

This she placed on the floor near the
hole she had made in the base board. Ail
aperture, Tom estimated, with the auger
withdrawn, to be about the size of a sil-
ver dollar. .

Next she produce a line steel ‘saw.
This, too, found itself in place alongside
the base board-, evidently to be usedin
enlarging the hole.

Then she lifted the hand-bag, placed it
carefully on the ﬂoor in the same spot,
and---

Turned out the light.

“Oh, confound it!” shot out Toni.

He set at work. That work ended very

shortly in a suppressed sigh, but one of
tremendous satisfaction and relief.
. He was in Sandoval’s room, ceasing to
-E wonder any longer that porch-climbers
 " ' and window sneak thieves were so com-
man.

He pushed the blinds to as they had
been. Then he stood still n dismay. The
window had begun to descend of its own
weigh.

, It stopped short of the sill, however,
' ' and there was no crash. .Tom tried to
accustom his eyes to the darkness.

Over in one corner was a bed with a
screen before it. Sandoval undoubtedly
lay there asleep.

Tom planned and planned and planned.
He was like enthusiastic and excited.
’ He would wait till the clairvoyant had
' developed her scheme to such an extent
7 “that proofs of its existence were undeni-
’ ably apparent.
Then he would wake up Sandoval,
V arouse the house, capture the woman,
‘and, incidentally, all the glory of .a bril-
'liant success in his first detective case!
. He sat .down noiselessly on the ﬂoor,
about ﬁve feet away from the spot where
‘ he estimated the woman was at work at
_ the other side of the partition, as eager,
, as nerved up as a bound watching for the
- appearance of its quarry.
, , There was the faintest glint of light in
the world in the room, proceeding from
some. distant apartment facing on the
hotel hall and reﬂecting dimly through
- the transom.
’_ 4 “It’s coming!" announced Tom, after
a breathless spell of watchfulness.

far distant aeolian‘ strain, faint, soothing
—so smooth and gentle as to be echoless
—the low murmur of musical notes fol-
lowed. The woman was certainly playing
on the ﬂute that Tom had seen in the
next apartment.

Tom began to grow uneasy. The situ-
ation brooded ominously. Things were
so unreal as it puzzle him.

The music ceased. There was a second
rustle ‘at the hole. Low, coaxing tones
purred vaguely.

Tom now had sight and soul centered
raptly on the aperture.

Outlines only he saw. Something
blocked it, he could make that out.

Something came through.

Horrors!

He gave a start that unnerved him so
that he became cold and weak all over.

A sluggish, wavy object blackened the
ﬂoor sinuously, with two spots bright as
ﬁre where its head moved about.

“A snake l” gurgled the appalled Tom,
way down in his throat.

The ﬂash of conviction, the rapid mem-
ory of the clairvoyant’s reference to her
grewsorne pets, back at the cafe, took
Tom’s breath away.

This woman, this siren, this snake-
charxner, was sending a poisonous serpent

‘to do her deadly work.

And before Tom could move to get out
of the way, before he could command
voice suﬂicient to raise an alarm, the rep-
tile, making for nearest human prey, was
upon him.

It crossed his feet, it wriggled its head
upright with a frightful hiss.

Paralyzed as he was with terror, Tom
never could understand later what supreme
power of will and energy spurred him up
to make a fearful struggle for life.

Like one inspired, he was on his feet
instantly, and the snake, big, slimy, hiss-
ing, wriggling, was in his grasp-——head

nearest or tail nearest,. he did. not know-—

he was too desperate to care.

In a frenzied, frightened way he was
swinging the snake around his head-fast,
fast, faster!

He let go.

Crashl .

Squarely for the transom he aimed,
squarely it shot for the mark. .

Then Tom stood like a statue,‘ rigid.

f : resume.

Tom heard her, low, purring voice at
the aperture. v

Then he saw come through it, beckon-'

: , _ing, ﬂittering brilliant jewels, as if to at-

tractor encourage her silent ally, a white,
small hand. . -

7 “In reach!” he uttered, in one fervent
gasp. T

I ~ He made a noiseless spring. Out shot

_' his own sinewy ﬁngers, true and sure as
 e an eagle clutch.

He had the woman he could not see by
the wrist ﬁrmly.

. “Listen!” spoke Tom. “I know you

 I /——-Viola, the clairvoyant. Listen! I know
 your

accomplice, Rankin. Listen! I
know your purpose——to kill the man
sleeping in this room—Sandoval”

 7  Dismay, fright, rage, mingled in a ﬂut-
I tering hiss from the ‘‘woman’s lips.

“Struggle, and I yell,” pursued Tom.
,“I’ve got you. If your hand was red-hot,

 1--wouldn’t let go.” ,
' . . ‘‘Who—who are you?”

CHAPTER ‘IX.
A HOT CHASE.
¢(He]p!9)

Tom fancied he uttered that word in ]

an appalling scream, loud enough to
reach the farthest corners of the hotel.

In reality it was a weak, choked whis-, . 

per, exaggerated by his distorted senses.
His brain only was active. His body held

in thrall by the deadly liquid the clair-J

vciyant had thrown into his face, Tom
was like a person in a nightmare.
“=Mercy !” t
A second’deluge of the volatile stuff-—

,burning, stinging, blinding—struck him.

This time Tom went back with a thud.

: . The action helped him, however. It took
him out of further reach of the woman  ‘
who seemed to be prepared to kill or. '

deaden to order. _ .

“Some poison——it will reach Sandoavl,
it will end both of us!” gasped Tom.

The powerful drug was diffusing itself
through the room. Had it not been for
the shattered transom and the slightly
raised window, Tom would have probably
dropped inert at once.

As it was, he could just hitch himself,
along on one hand and one knee, like a-

person grievously wounded.-

The movement took him out of range. i_,_

She has ﬂed--there is no doubt of it.
Left that snake behind. Won’t it create
a sensation! And Sandoval wasn't in the
room at all 1”

All the mani‘fol»d details of the situa-
tion tnmbled incoherently over one an-
other in Tom’s mind.

The main issue, however, rose clear as
crystal before hing-—he must not lose
sight of the clairvoyant.

Tom went down the ﬁre-escape ladder
faster than he had come up it, reached
the ﬂat roof of the two story frame build-
ing next adjoining, ran to its front and
peered over the cornice.

“In time!” he ﬂuttered. staring down.

Viola, the claivoyant, had just left the
private entrance to the hotel.

She ﬂitted down the pavement past his
range of vision with rapid, nervous steps. ‘

Suddenly she paused, turned her head,
caught sight of a cab coming tearing
down the street, and glided to the curb,
holding up her ﬁnger. _

“Quick 1'' she said, simply. _

The driver only half halted his horse.

“Cab?” he queried.

“Yes-—-double fare, but quick!" ,
. “Got a load, ma'am. Wait one minute,
half a minute; deliver just around the
corner-. Then at your service. " L

“Hurry!” breathed Viola, in an in-  1 
tense tone. ' 

Tom understood her anxiety. She
feared pursuit from the hotel at any to . » 
merit. ' » _ I

He saw his opportunity all the clearer, .:« ::

“Tell Mr. Carter—-—-—” and Bill went
over the message word for word twice in
succession like a child memorizing a les-
son.

‘‘That’s it. Don’t forget Sandoval—~.-
don’t mix the names. Here we are.”

At a word from the woman the cab cir-
cled to the curb in front of a grim, shut-
tered two story house. V

It was detached, and as Viola, tossing -a
bank-note to the cab driver, alighted, ran
up somes steps, unlocked a door,—and let
herself in, Tom dropped from the seat,
and, with a wave of the hand to Bill,
glided into the dark side passageway.

He heard. the cab rattle away, and he
chuckled. Nick Carter would temporarily
take King Sandoval oﬁ his hands. The ‘
king would be safe till Ton: found time
to personally report to the detective.

“I’ve run the woman to her den--the
rest is easy,” decided Tom. 

He crouched between the two build
ings and listened. He could plainly hear
some one inside the house ascend a pair
of stairs. ‘ ,

“Then,” continued Rankin, “I re-
solved on a daring move——to risk all.
Heretofore I had kept strictly in the
backgroimd. I formulated my plan, I
made sure where Sandoval was, I pre-
pared my game, and I went to see him.”

“Well 1”

“He was glad to meet me again. I led
the conversation promptly to the attempts
on his life. I told him that knowledge of
the same had brought me from Rochester,
post haste, to his side——-I persuaded him
that the attempts on his life were being
made by hired emissaries of the insur-
gents of his home kingdom of Norona. ”

‘_‘A clever play,” commented the clair-

kingdom, friendly to him, had come to
the home of my sister, expecting to ﬁnd
him with her. He brought some impor-

ing Sandoval that he must he at a certain

“The box of papers is not a box of

-papers-” ’

“Then "

“But,” continued Rankin, impressive-
ly, “a box of dynamite, supplied with a
clockwork fuse, timed to strike ﬁre at just
eight o’clock this morning!”

“Clever!" '

“Horrible!” ,

The listening. Tom broke into a cold
perspiration. He almost fell against the
rarnshackly door.

 

His breath came in painful gasps. The _

cool heartlessness of these plotters, _the
sure, direful danger menacing King San-
doval, appalled him.  ‘
“In other words,” concluded Rankin,
lifting from his pocket a long envelope
and waving it triumphantly, “by noon

,to-day the telegraph will announce that

enough ‘of an unfortunate being has been
picked up along the tracks near Martins-

. burg to be identiﬁed as the remains of

"Sandoval, king of Norona.
., “Before a week, on the strength of that
identiﬁcation, I shall present this to the
proper parties, and draw my well-earned
rew_ard——one hundred thousand dollars.”
In indescribable agitation, Nick Car-
ter’s newsboy friend wavered where he
stood. .
He noted the oﬂicial-looking envelope,
he observed on the table where the two
plotters sat, at Rankin’s elbow, a revolver

‘—he took in every detail of his environ-

ment in a frenzy born of desperate re-
solve. ‘

Was ever such a cold-blooded crime
meditated ?—was ever human being placed
in the terrible circumstances of responsi-

, bility that now surrounded him? He for-

got for the moment ;that he was Nick
Carter’s pupil, an emissary of justice—he

became a purely impulsive, generous-.

hearted boy only,’indignant at an awful
wrong, inspired to save the life of an im-
periled human being.

Creak—he drew the door ‘open. in a
ﬂash. Gr.ab—-grip——one hand tore the en-
velope from the grasp of the astounded
Rankin, the other snatched up the revol-
ver at h'is[elb'ow.

“Move, and I ﬁre I” rang out clear and
menacing ash pistol shot. ‘

“The boy I” screamed the clairvoyant.
' ’ ;‘~‘.We are »lo’st~if, he-——-,—” , ‘  "

  
 

“Escapes? I've done it!”

Doughty Tom ﬁnished the sentence.
He fairly slid back into the room. He
was across it and at the open window in
a twinkling.

He heard the others after him. It was
a leap for life-—a race for life after that.

He barely glanced down. Then he
poised on the winbw sill, a deliberate
purpose in view.

Slam l—he landed where he aimed for
-—the box of the wagon below.

Undoubtedly this vehicle had been em-
ployed .by Rankin to bring him to this
secluded part of Jersey City.

The sharp noise aroused the unhitched
horse. It started up with a snort.

Tom was ﬂung to the floor of the
wagon. Scrambling up, he saw two void,
white faces back at the window of the
house from which he had just escaped.

Tom got hold of the whip, and lashed
up the horse. His initial idea was to get
beyond pursuit.

This point be safely covered, after one
or two turns. Then he began to know
where he was.

“The Midland?” he soliloquized,
breathlessly. “That must be two miles
away. Left at two? The explosion at
eight. If I only had wings!”

Heart and soul, mind, nerves, energy
—Tom became an ardent living spirt of
resolve and endeavor as he ﬂew down the
deserted streets.

The horse was in a lather, his hands
chafed and cut with urging and holding
the steed, as he drew up beside the fence
surrounding the track -yards of the Mid-
land Central Railroad.

“Whoa!”

Tom jumped from the wagon, aban-
doning it, and darted through a break in
the fence. A

He made out the passenger depot per-
haps three hundred yards ahead, with
few lights and little stir or action about
it. -
Here, however, an engine puffed on
the main track, seemingly coaled and
watered for some early morning run.

Near it was a shanty, with several men
loun ing, » ﬁxing lanterns and getting
ready for work. V -

Tom approached one of them who was

smoking and half reclining on a bench. 

 
  

  

“Mister,” he said, sharply, “this is
the Midland?”

“Sure." .

M “I want to get to Doversville. ”
“Right place, my son.”
“How soon?”

“Two hours — first
o”’clock.” ,

, “Andwhen do we arrive?” inquired

' Tom,4dubionsly.

' “Slow local——eight—forty-ﬁve.”

. “I can’t wait!” answered Tom, vehe-
 mently. ~. , _

' . “Got to, I reckon. No other road runs
‘there, and—-you see that engne ?" asked
the man, pointing to the one steamed
up‘)!

“Yes,” nodded Tom.

. “I run her-twenty-three. She takes
7 out the Doversville accommodation.”
Tom retreated to the fence. On a pile
._ ;of rails he sat down. ,.

He was quivering with uncertainty,
excitement, suspense.

_ h He must overtake King Sandoval—-

v ow? _
’ Every moment was precious. ‘At eight
o’clock-'——four brief hours‘ ahead-—the
timed box of dynamite would go oh‘.

Tom knew something about the inte-
rior mechanism of a locomotive, but not
srrtﬁcient to start up without a jerk that
sent his cap spinning, and the wheels of
the engine plowing the polished rails
With 3 rippetty-rip whir that brought the
men about the railroad shanty to their
feet in consternation.

Hg was 03 with a thrill, and one
glance ahead, showing the main track set
with clear signals. He gave the whistle-
rope a triumphant jerk.

Then Tom subsided to the cushioned
seat of the engineer, trembling from head
to foot, his hopeful yet apprehensive
heart going like a trip hammer.

“I’ve done it! There’s no backing out
now," he breathed. “Fifteen minutes
after four.”

Tom read the time on the little cab .

clock, and reckoned as far as he could the
chances of his arriving safely at his pro-
posed destination.

Uutil clear out of the city, he passed ‘

only a dozen persons—two were watch-
men, the others railroad employees going
to their work. ~ A

They simply stated after the scndding
“special,” which they supposed it to he.
Where therewere a lot of switches, a man
in the signal tower made ‘some frantic
gesticulations from its window.

Not’ understanding them, Torn could
not heed them. It was fortunate that he
had done what no regular engineer had
ever dared to..do—cross the tracks of two
other systems without stopping—at an
early hour when trains were few.

“Seven mileé," read Torn from a ﬂy-
ing mile post. “How long has it taken?
Sixteen minutes. At this rate I shall be
at Doversville before six o’clock. I dare
go faster now. ”

Torn grew calmer as moments and
miles sped away. There were two sets of
rails, few switches, and he ventured to
increase speed slowly.‘

He passed the depot of quite a large
town. » There was some stir about it, and
he pulled the lever another notch, for he

the steam valves haphazard. Everything
seemed to be going all right.

A slight qualm of fear oppressed Tom
as he fancied the results of his wild es-
capade. ' '

He had blocked a system, disturbed its
schedule—he might wind up in damage
and disaster.

“Can't help it,” piped Torn. “What’s
forty railroads to one human life? Let
her go! My !”

Tom held his breath as he turned a
curve. A locomotive ahead seemed hear-
ing directly down on him, but as it came
nearer it passed safely on the other track.

His joy knew no bounds as he ﬂashed
past a little station bearing the indication
that it was thirtymiles from the city.

’ It was just twenty-ﬁve minutes of six.

“I shall be in time, sure—-a full two
hours to put after Sandoval,” calculated
Tom. “What’s this ?-—what’s this?”

Tom, of course, had no means of know-
ing that No. 23 here left the train, re-

‘ versed, and got headed right for a return

to the city after running up to Dovers-

ville, so before he knew it he was oﬁ on

a spur track and headed for a turntable.
Tom turned pale as he snatched‘ at the

lever and throttle. He turned paler as the S

locomotive halted with. a jerk, two
wheels oﬁ the rails, and tilted dangerous-
ly for the turntable pit, which it had nar-
rowly escaped‘ going into.
. »He tried to get it back on the track,
but made matters worse instead.

“Stuck !” he muttered, grimly-“now
whatever am I to do?”

There seemed nothing for it but to foot
it the remaining ten miles.
' Tom was a good runner, and in» shape
for a fair sprint, but he doubted very
niuch if he could ov'ertake Sandoval be-

" fore eight o'clock now.

He buckled manfully down to his task,
Back the. spur track he ran,
headed down the main road bed, and just
passing the little depot building, halted

i' with a cheery cry.

Tilted up against the structure was the

., ‘railroad agent’s bicycle. Tom ’s eyes
danced. . No one was in view, and he had

it on the rails in a twinkling. .
.2-“Great!” he voiced, as he got the hang

  contrivance, and whirled ahead at
theiate  miles an hour.

Doversville! There was the sign—here
was his destination at last.

Tom ditched the bicycle, ran to the
depot pump, took a deep draught of cool-
ing water, and glanced in at the depot
window. '

“Just ﬁve minutes after six he mur-
mured. “Oh, say! is this the railroad
running to Martinsburg ?"

A man passing in a loaded farm wagon
nodded assentingly in reply to the ques-
tion, and Tom started down a single road
bed leading into the timber.

According to Rankin’s statement this
was the route Sandoval would pursue.
He must have got pretty near to Martins-
burg by this time,” Tom decided.

“'I‘here’sjust one thing sure," he rum-
iuated——“betweeu here and Martinsburg
I shall ﬁnd him. There‘s only one thing
to do—count on running twenty miles in
two hours, if necessary and keeping my
eye out sharp so I don't pass him on the
way‘):

After proceeding what he judged to be
about twelve miles, Tom was more ex-

cited than ﬂustered as he sat down on a _

heap of railroad ties to rest.

“I shall catch Sandoval before eight
o’clock,” he told himself, conﬁdently.
“l’ve run the ﬁrst twelve miles in a little
over an hour. It was a spurt, but-—l
won’t be beat! I’ll take a look around
and forge ahead."

Tom climbed to the top of the heap of
ties. It was loose, it was wobbly but he
got a secure foothold at its apex.

Shading his eyes with his hands, he
took a good look down the straight road
bed.

“No one in sight,” he reported. “San-
doval’s got a good lead on me, that's
sure.”

Tom wondered if he might not have
passed Sandoval, and he trembled in-
wardly. -

Butas he swe t the rugged, brambly
stretch lining t e railroad he was reas-
sured, for no sane being would choose
such a difficult course when offered the

much smoother route of the ballasted _ 

trackways. ~ *
Just. completing this survey, however,

Torn checked his glance at a spot some.
thirty feet from the tracks, stared hard,

  

   

peered closer yet, and gave utterance to a
startled:

“>1 declare!”

He was very greatly surpirsed at what
he saw—so much so that it took him a
minute or two to realize fully what he
had discovered. '

“It’s my man, it's Sandoval,” breathed
Tom. “Lucky? oh, just!”

Over near a lot of straggly bushes, ly-
ing ﬂat on the ground, apparently sound
asleep, was the kingly personagein whom
Tom had taken so powerful an interest
during the past twenty-four hours.

Not a bit royal looking, however, was
 the ruler of Norona. His attire was disor-
gil. . dered, his features were ﬂushed and swol-
" km, and by his side was a token that he

was ruled by a monarch stronger far than

himself.

“Two kings,” mused Tom——-“King
Sandoval and King Alcohol, and the last
holds the winning hand at present. Too
bad. Mr. Carter says he drinks to drown
his troubles. He’s been dousing them
good since daybreak, then, for there’s a
quart bottle, and it's empty.”

_ Tom reasoned out the situation. San-
~ doval, after being put aboard the train by
g Rankin, had secured the liquor in some

way, had solaced his lonely walk from
 Doversville with frequent potations, had
 stumbled oﬁ the course and had dropped
_ into a sodden heap._ ,

' .. “Box and all,” continued Tom. “Say,

after a momentary blur, and then—knew
the worst. a

It was the very worst. In a word, he
had dislodged the loose logs forming the
heap of ties, and they had borne him
down, imprisoning him.

Tom did not mind the bruises and
scratches he experienced, the terriﬁc
blow on the head that had so nearly
stunned him, the excruciating pain of
one limb now held as in a vise way back
in the topsy-turvy heap.

It was his utter helplessness that con-
founded him. In a frenzied way Tom re-
alized that he was a captive, held so close,
so ﬁrmly, that to move meant to bring
down upon him a score of crushing logs,
that, unaided, he could never hope to es-

cape.

It was singular how, without breaking -

every bone in his body, the mass held
both feet from the knees down in a clasp
as neat as if artiﬁcially produced. Tom
looked about him in despair.

“I can’t get out without help, I may
as well make my mind up to that,” he
muttered, grimly, at last. “What time
is it? Pretty near half-past seven. I must
wake Sandoval up, arouse him to his
danger, dispose of the dynamite and get
him to help me out of this ﬁx.”

Tom fancied that an easy task, but he
found out his mistake after ten minutes’
eﬁort.

He shouted at Sandoval, he whistled.
he screamed. The man might be deaf,
stone dead, for all the attention he paid.

“This is serious!” muttered Tom.
“Why, if Ishouldn’t be able to arouse
him—-—” 4 S

Tom's heart stood still, and he shud-
dered as he thought out the balance of
that dread sentence.

Sandoval was some twenty feet from
him, and the bushes screened him
slightly. -

_ Tom reached out for all the missiles in
view. They were not numerous-—a few

little pieces of gravel and fragments of L,

bark.

He began to shy these at the sleeper.
Some fell short of their mark from sheer
llghtnﬁssi. others grazed with no “effect.

W Those that struck the slnmberer’s fea-
tures only jmade him stir slightly, as
might a ﬂy_ walking acres-his. face.~

   

   

  

   
 
 
 
 
  
   
    
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
  
 
  
   
  
 
 
  
  
 

‘‘He’s dead gone, and we’re both gone
up!” decided Tofu, glooniily, after half
an hour of futile shouting and fusilading.
“It’s drawingnear the hour. It’s pretty
close up to—oh, what’s that!”

It was a low, ominous, whirring
,. sound.

It came directly from inside the box
that pillowed the head of the sleeping
' King‘. Sandoval, but it never ruﬂled his
sodden wits. 1

‘‘We’re a goner!” pronounced Tom, in
an awed, lots whisper. “The dynamite is

beginning to go oﬁ !”

useless to him in his present predicament,
ﬂuttered to the ground.

The sounds he had just heard told him
that the fuse inside the box of dynamite
had probably been lighted.

Tom’s ﬁngers closed about tl e revolver
he had taken from his pocket with the
paper—the weapon with which he had
/cowed its owner, Rankin.

He ﬁred a shot in the air, and eagerly
watched Sandoval. °

The latter never moved. It seemed as
if a cannon ﬁred at his ear would fail to
arouse him, so profound was his sleep.

Then Tom pricked up his ears anew.
Another sound, a louder sound, drowned
out all those clicking, whirring demon-
strations from the box under Sandoval’s
head.

“A train!” he breathed. “I hear it.
I see it. The headlight, the cab. Stop!
Hey! Help! help! help!” a

Tom screamed like a madman. His
eyes started from their sockets, he waved
one hand frantically.

“They must stop!" he cried, shrilly.

Bang—bang—bang—bang !

What guided his hand but frenzied im-
pulse Tom could not tell, but every shot
told on the windows of the cab.

Toot! toot! down brakes; ,hiss-swish!
the train came to a stop.

“This way !—-oh, this way!” shouted
Tom.

“What’s this? Who ﬁred? Train rob-
bets?” demanded the engineer, storming
up to the spot, an iron bar in his hand.

“No, say—quick! See that man
asleep?”

“See him? I should say——-’

“The box under his head-—-oh, for
mercy’s sake! No delay, no questions.
Get it. ‘That's it. Throw it far as you
can!” -' 

“Burr-rr-r !’ ’

If the quick pistol shots and the crash-
ing panes in the cab had startled the en-
gineer, the frightful, awful explosiorrof

the dynamite box, hurled into the water A

. pool just in time, fairly scared him out of
his wits. -

Running for his life back to the loco-
motive, his clothing riddled with gravel
ﬁred like bullets, drenched with a deluge
like’a waterspout, he was screaming in
aﬁright like a maniac. ‘

' 3'

  
   
   

King Sandoval woke up at last. He
stared vaguely about him.

“What was that?” he? maundered.
“Your death-warrant !‘ ’ pronounced
. Tom, solemnly.

. “What do you say!” »

“Voided by a supersedeas from Nick
Carter—arrived just in time!”

The conductor of the train, supported
by a crowd of passengers, came hurrying
pale-faced to the spot.

For ten minutes life was an incoherent
whirl to every person in the vicinity.

They even made Tom tell his story
;over twice before they consented to set

him free.

Then, as he was helped to the train,
-the wonderful thing he had done began
to dawn on the throng, and he was a hero
clear to the next station. l _
Tom was in bad shape for walking
with his bruised limbs, but he had the
sense and courage to immediately impress
the telegraph into his service. '

. Nick Carter got a very complete idea of

what had happened, and who had caused
» it to happen, within the next hour.

Tom and Sandoval were directed by the
.'detective to return to New York on the
noon train. ‘

Their, reception at the city depot was in
the nature of an ovation. '
Nick and several of his students formed
one welcoming party, a group of report-
 ers another. _

7 _ The Sandoval case was public property
at law, because, through Tom‘s direc-
tions, the arrest of both Rankin and the
clairvoyant, Viola, had been consummated
that morning. » ‘

Tom blushed, too modest to tell.

“It's about this young hero, Billy,"
said Sandoval, -placing a grateful hand
on Tom's shoulder—“it’s about the won-
derful exploits of Nick Carter’s Newsboy
Friend.”

“Right!” nodded the detective him-
self. “Full account of a boy who is able
to give a most excellent account of him-
self, as the central ﬁgure in elucidating
the ins and outs of the Great Sandoval

than any others.

We refer to the writings of Oliver Optic, Horatio Alger, Edward S. Ellis,
Lieut. Lounsberry, James Otis, William Murray G-raydon, etc.

Unfortunately, they have heretofore been procurable only in expensive binding at from

01.00 to $1. 50 each. The average boy has not got $1. 50 to invest.

ANOTHER NEW IDEA

The Shield Weekly»

TRUE DETECTIVE STORIES

Are stranger than fiction. THE SHIELD WEEKLY is a new series or Detective Stories, but it is
“ something different." Street & Smith’s long experience in the publishing business has taught
them that the average man and boy like nothing better than good detective stories. We have, in
the past, published many of the old style, where the detective passes through a series of marvelous
and hairbreadth escapes and finally secures his quarry. THE SHIELD WEEKLY will, however, be an
absolutely rim‘ departure. Each and ever number of the weekly will contain a history of a
complete and intricate crime, the solution 0 which is worked out by the skill and ability of the

detectives. ‘
THESE ARE TRUE STORIES

absolute chapters of experience taken
from the note books of the greatest
and most noted Chiefs of Police in
the largest cities of America secs.» V
Their fund of knowledge upon this subject has been drawn upon by special arrangement. We
propose to demonstrate to the reading public of America through the SHIELD WEEKLY that the true
histories of real crimes contain as much and more of romance than do the r'n1agI'rIatiw tales
which have been constructed in the past by the -writers of detective stories. We feel that the
time is ripe tor the presentation of this absolutely new class of detective tales. The ﬁrst numbers
in this series will consist of manuscripts from records in the archives of the Boston police, as repre-
sented by INSPECTOR WATTS, who is well known throughout the New England States, in
fact, throughout America. as one of the slirewdext and max! (lever Sucre! Service Qrjicmls in the
world. The great inspectors of other large cities of the country will ﬁgure in due course.
