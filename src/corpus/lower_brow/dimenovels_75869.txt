putting his head in at the doorway of the wash-

room where Tom Trevor, known as Messenger 21,

’ was removing‘ some ink stains from his ﬁngers.

‘ands and then making a bee-line for the outside
ﬂiice. . V . ‘
“Here, Tom, take this envelope to Muncy &

boy, together with the customary slip. '

They tried to pull him down from his pedestal, ~

but they might have saved themselves the
trouble, for their individual eﬁ'orts availed noth-

Trevor had incurred his ill~will by interfering ‘be-,

whom he was bullying. Patsy’s pugnacious ten- .
dencies induced him to attack Tom, fully expect-.

ing to do up the Wall Street messenger’ boss and
tumble him from his throne. Tom, however, was

skilled in the science of self-defense, and he put;

it all over Patsy inside of five minutes.

Flynn’s pride was humbled. and his prominence '
as a bully somewhat eclipsed. He sworeito get’
even with the boss messenger at the first chance, '

but the sort of chance he was looking‘ for had
not yet materialized. Tom lived with his mother‘,

who was a widow in straitened.circumstances,'in‘ ‘
. a modest Harlem ﬂat.

He had two sisters

younger than himself, one of whom was cashier  J

in a grocery store in their’ neighborhood, and
added her mite to the family income. Mrs. Trevor

thought Tom was the finest boy in the world, and ' "

his sisters had the same idea, which was only

natural, but as they were not alone in that.opin- . “

g Mooney picked up a lamp'and led the way_to
» the cellar. It was a musty, dirty place, ﬁlled with
wrubbish that had evidently been there a long time.
Cobwebs festooned the beams of the ceiling, like
’ great black stalactites in some underground cav-
;,ern where the water had oozed through the rocks
‘for centuries and froze. Mooney. looked around
for a suitable spot to put their prisoner. There
wasn't much choice, so he was bound to one of
the wooden supports of the house. i
V “Sorry to leave you in the dark,” said, Mooney,
“but alight wouldn’t do you much good, and we
aven’t a spare lamp. There are no ghosts down
I here, but there may be a few rats. They _won 1:
‘hurt you. I'll fetch you somethin to eat in the
‘morning,’ so make yourself ‘as com ortable as you
‘n till then.” v “ l
The men then left him, and he saw them mount
the stairway in the corner with feelings that may
 better imagined than described. — '
 “This is a nice situation to be in,” he muttered.
“What will mother think when I. don’t show up
..."(-pnight? She?ll think I’ve_ met with an‘ accident,
. iand‘ she won’t sleep a wink. Well, it can't be
'_.liel ed..." I am going to make an effort_to get free
‘ ' . “can, if it takes me all night to do it.”
 ‘After ‘making a vigorous ‘effort, he found that
“the men had made a pretty good job of tying him.
It struck him, however, that the post was not as
Tsolidas one might expect of a houseisupport. He
felt‘ it shift under his exertions. So he began kick-
ing at it with his heels. The beam shivered, show-
ing that it had rotted away at its base. Bracing

imself, against the cement ﬂoor, he pressed back ,

on the post. Little by little he workedit further
am-,_of' the perpendicular, thereby loosening it at
‘the top. To get it free above was whathe aimed
:at, since the bottom had no longer any hold on the
ground. ' . _ ‘ /, *
it was not an easy Job he had on his hands, but

e was agstout lad and when he made up his mind
to accomplish anything he ke t persistently _?«t It
ll it was done. He worke steadily vawaykfor
more. than an hou\r before the bent nails ﬁnally
, just their grip and the post came away altogether. .
»Although‘ he could now walk about,_he was not
£1'ee.by.any means. .He was bound  htly_ to the
loosepost, andhad to carry the _arti_c e with him
‘herever he moved.“ After considering the mat-

V ’ ‘a 1111 he thought of a way, oi’. freeing~
.91./T ‘lie ‘lfelt ‘around tilllie found the wall, ,

 

THEY COME s f- 9 ,  «
he began to work the rope toward the wall.“ This
was a slow process, but every inch accomplished '
was so much nearer freedom of his arms. It was
long after midnight when he got the rope to the »
end and slipped it off the rotten end of the post.
He was then able to free himself of the rope 9.1- ' '
together. On the -whole it was something of an

achievement, and he felt quite tickled over his
success.

“Now to leave the cellar and then the house,’.’i
he said to himself as he struck a match and looked
around. The light enabled him to locate the
stairs, and he started toward them. Then the idea
occurred .to him that it would be a great thing
if he could rescue Edna Baldwin, who waste pris-
oner somewhere in the house. That would get his
name in the papers and, besides, would save her
father from paying the kidnappers the $50,000’ .
they demanded. It was a riskv thing to attempt, ' " H
as the three men who were in the house doubtless. l
slept with one eye open, asthe saying is, for they " ‘

I could not tell but the detectives working on the ll‘ V

case might locate them at any moment. However,» .
he felt that it was his duty to save the girl if he
could. Indeed,'he ﬁgured that it would show a ‘
lack of grit on his part to make his escape with-
out making some move in her interest. Having de- A
cided to see what he could do to euchre the kids“
nappers, Tom made his way out of the cellar.

 

 

CHAPTER VI.—Tom Rescues Edna Baldwin.-_

 

The entrance to the cellar was through a door at,
one end of the kitchen, and the men had not locké ”
ed it, because they had no key to do it with. ;They- "
took it for granted thatit was impossible for their; ,1,
prisoner to get free, no matter how much he tried
to do so. Tom peeped through the keyhole before
he turned the handle, but all was dark and silent
in the room. Satisﬁed of this fact,he ventured to
open the door. As his eyes were accustomed to V 
the darkness of the cellar, the kitchenappeared 3 ‘
quite light in contrast, for it had two vlindowé. ‘ l
and the sky‘ having cleared since theyoung mes-- '
senger Was captured, a certain amount of light
came through them and showed up every object 
in,the room. _ ' ' v

V There was a small stove, four chairs, ‘a plain f
deal table and a cupboardwith dishes and other,‘
housekeeping articles. There were also a few p‘an:"3" i
and agate pots hanging from nails driven into
the wall. Everything wasnew, having been 1120- H
vided for the object the rascals had in view. Tom’ ‘
removed his shoes and glided over to the door that f
admitted him into a small entry. Here he pausetlir
and listened, but the house was quite silent, He,
opened a door in front of him and looked 'into,a q
dark apartment. He struck a match and sawi ’ '
that the room was bare and untenanted. Prob-., i
ably this had’ been the dining-room of the house’-.1
He crossedto a door and passing through found
himself in the main hall with a. wide flight 
stairs leading to tlieﬂoor above. The hall doe):
was on his right. He saw that by removing itlﬁ
bar, unslipging the chain and turning the loéy; .
in the lock e could make his esca e in a;

.Miss.« Baldwin was. Everything wasdark on the
‘second landing and Tomdid not dare strike a light.
, . Listening intently; he heard the deep breathing‘ of
‘ . a sleeper. Clearly, the door of the room ;where
thisim'an was sleeping was open. Tom hardly.
knew how to proceed.‘ Without a light he felt all

awhile listening, but no sound. reached hisears.

u“I’ll be there at nine .o’clock.”

being very busy, was’ unable to get to the little?
bank'to—sel1,his share_s until half-past two, when‘
it was going at 102 and afraction. T  . 
Then an errand took him up ...to -Pine street T
and he stopped at the bank on the way and cl’ ‘_ ',
out his deal. The ﬁgures on the.b1g' blackboard;
showed him what the stock was ruling atthe

 

and consequently he felt might good. Tw.g._0_;3,
three days elapsed, during which J... &- C: ha
taken a sudden tumble, before he found a chance’

The man at the other end of the wire said he’d
‘wait, as he’d sooner have Tom than any other

’ engrossed his attention. That he wasdeeply interj

and key, and he hoped the man was with him.
Soon after his arrival the detective called to see
him. Then Tom found, much to his disap oint-
ment, that neither Flynn nor the presume kid- _
napper had been captured. Patsy had evidently
gone in hiding, for the oiﬁcer could not ﬁnd him
at his home or around the neighborhood. That
day‘ a broker acquaintance of Tom’s told_him_ to
buy, L. & M. stock and hold it for a ten-ipomt rise,
if he wanted to‘ make a haul.

“It’s a perfectly safe lay for you to make,”
he told the boy, “but you must get on the Job
within a day or two in order to et the cream." .

Tom thanked him and said e would take
advantage of his ti . Next day he ‘brought his
$5O08down and put it up on 50 shares of L. & M.
at 7 . ’

“If it oes up ten foints I’ll double my money,"
he tlioug t. “Then ’ll be worth $1,000.”

He was blissfully ignorant of the fact that
he was already worth $10,000 deposited with a
certain trust company for investment in a first-
class mortgage at a guaranteed interest of 4 1-2'
per cent. -

Tom went blithely about his duties that day,
for he saw $500 proﬁt comin to him in h.is mind’s
eye, and that was exceeding y pleasant. He was
sitting in the oﬂice about six o'clock,‘ calculating *
that in two hours more he would be off for the
day, when a telephone call came‘ in from a Broad-
way store for a messenger. Tom was calledup '
and dispatched to the place.

A man who had been lounging outside the office
for half an hour fell in behind him and followed
him to the store. He saw that it was a jewelry

establishment that Tom went into, and he waited

till the bo% came out with a’ small package’ in
his hand. om started up Broadway, and when
he came to Cortlandt street he turned down to-
ward the ferry. The strange man was only a
short distance» behind him when he walked into

the ferry house and bought, a couple of ferrg  ’

tickets. The man, bought one "for himself an
boarded _the boat after the boy. ‘ . .
Reaching the Jersey City side of the river, Tom

got on the car ,of a certain trolley line, and the‘ _ 7

maxi got on also. After going a number of bloclis,
Tom alighted and walked three or four blocks in
the resi entialisection, taking note of the streets
and the numbers on the houses. Finally he lo-

cated the place he was bound for and rang the

bell. A servant came to the ‘door.

“Does Mr. George Brown live here?” he asked. 1- U

V CHAPTER XI.—Tom in the Toils Again; -

Itwas many hours later when Tom -Trevor re-_

covered his senses. The first thing he became
aware of was a sever ain in his head, at the
Zspot where the blackjac had landed on it.

The next, that instead of being on the street he’

was in a dark room. He knew it was a room,
for his eyes were able to make out the four walls,
though the ceiling was indistinct. There ‘was
nbthing in the room but the mattress on which
‘he lay, anda three-legged stool a few feet away.
is he lay he heard a confused murmur of voices.

The sounds came from an adjoining room. He’

I leaned his head against the baseboard and lis-
‘ttened. He distinctly made out men speaking close

at hand," but could not distinguish what was said._

, He remembered being struck down in the
street, but had no idea who delivered the blow.
He reasoned that it must have been the man
whose path he had crossed, for he seemed to have

‘ . been the only person anywhere near him atvthe
time. Why had the man laid him out, and had

,_some -person living in the neighborhood picked

' him up and carried him into this house.

 Tom asked himself these and other questions
, bearing on the subject, he could not supply the
answers. He was not bound’, therefore‘, e rea-

soned, that he was not in ‘the hands of enemies,

and he trusted that he would come out of the

 p scrape all right. ~ _
-T , He decided to leave the room and hunt up the
people of the house. ‘He got on his feet, feeling
* weak and dizzy, and then was glad to postpone his
pur ose for a short time until he felt better. Sud-
den y he heard the door of the room -being.un-
, locked. The next instant he was blinded by the
inroad of a bright light, whichcame from a lamp

held in the hands of somebody behind it. ‘

home to see his anxious mother. During the
afternoon he took the cedar wood box to ‘a lock-

contained a small collection of diamonds and other

“They are now all in jail at Jersey City, so
there is nothing to prevent you from proceeding
against them for the abduction of your daughter,”

  Boss of the Baseball BOYS

By GASTON GARNE 

(.15. Serial Story.)

‘ CHAl’TER"XI.——(Contz'nued) —

; Already two balls were being batted a.round_the
ﬁeld, and as our_. hero came out of. the dressing-
roomyhe saw a high ﬂy -heading straight for a car-
_a ed that had halted Just outside the‘ enclosure,
11119 the gentleman in charge of it was paying
theadmission fee. _
T : Short—stop Sam did not look to see who the oc-
,ci1"pan,ts' of the turnout were. He only noticed that
_ ere were ladies in it, ‘and the ball, according to
jildgment, was going to land right in the
e ce. ‘
“VI-Ielmade a run for it, dropping the hat he had
in his hand when he came out, hoping; to be in
time-to head off the ball. _
«y1,".‘Look out!" some one shouted to the driver;
"‘the‘ball!” . I ‘I ,

1Then.it was that the gentleman and two ladies
in ‘the carriage saw the descending. sphere.

‘*p Sam just in time to prevent it from landing

The carriage moved around to a place where .
several other turnouts had gathered; and Sam . " I
went at the grounders that were now being batted ?_ "
out for his special beneﬁt with a vim. ~ "
The work of the boy in that practice was really
faultless. It seemed that me had a streak of good , .
luck upon him, for no matter what chance he took '
at getting the ball he always laid hold of it. ; r
His throwing, too, was superb and cheer after, ""
cheer went up at his lightning-like plays.
But _the visiting team soon arrived, and after
they had donned their natty gray uniforms they
got the ﬁeld for practice. ' , V
The college boys were a likely—looking lot. They
showed great speed, too, and the impression they  _
made upon the rapidly gathering crowd was .3 ~ » I
good one. ‘ A ‘
At‘ length the practice was all over. The bell
rang, the umpire stepped out and the players took
their positions. -
The toss had been won by the visitors, so they
took the ﬁeld. _ p
The pitcher was a stocky built, athletic‘fellow,

and was easily twenty years of age.

He was a “southpaw,” or left-handed pitcher,’ .“',~
more properly speaking. » ' 2. a

Jack ,»Cuny and Len Marks came upon the, ' 
grandstand along with a half dozen members of y '
the swell club just as the game was starting. 7 ‘

“So has Jack Cuiiy, I think,” was the reply. 3. _
“B'ut‘I am satisﬁed that there is no such thing as '. . 
‘honor in either of them. I wonder how they liked .
the article ‘in the Gazette?” —.

“I’ll bet they squirmed when they read it.”

“Reardon at the bat!” called out the scorer, and

  

-.\that stopped the conversation between our hero

‘and the third baseman. « X - V
“Line her out, Dan!” called out Harry Bates, as
herlstarted down the line toward first base to 
coac . I ' I ; ‘,
The southpaw proved to be a tricky pitcher, and 
Reardon could not even hit the ball, much less
line it out. ,— 
“T_hree strikes—-‘—out!” bawled the loud-voiced
umpire. , ,
Tom McGuire was "the next ‘to toe the scratch. ‘*  ’ "
At the very first ball‘ pitched he batted a higlim‘ 
foul which was nabbed by the Rutclilfe third,  7
baseman after a long run. . g‘ ‘
It was a good catch, and the player was _'
roundly applauded from thegrandstand.  '

CANADA NOW MARKS "THE SITES OF  

% MOUS HISTORICAL EVENTS
Many of the important historic sites in Canada

have been rebuilt where the ruins of buildings and
sites have permitted, but there are still many «

which have no visible means of identiﬁcation but
are of sutﬁcient importance to-warrant recogni-
tion and identiﬁcation. ‘The Department of the
Interior has been enga ed in the work of mark-
ing such

far. 118 have been marked by the erection of

of the Historic Sites and Monuments Boardtthe

suggestions of the members are reviewed and ‘a

number of sites are recommended for marking.
In 1927 tablets were placed on twenty—ﬁve.sites

and one of the most picturesque ceremoniesnin.

this connection was the unveiling of the cairn
and tablet at Blackfoot Crossin , near where the
Cluny-Milo section of the Aberta Provincial
Highway crosses the. Bow River. This memo-
rial commemorates the signing on geptember -22,

1877. near this point, of Treaty 7, by which the . ’ "

wide plains were thrown open to the white man
and peace and security were assured the Indians.

The unveiling took place on the ﬁftieth anniver-; t ’ ‘ C

sary_of the signing, the principals in which were
David Laird and Lieut. Col. James F. McLeod,
representing the Crown, and the famous Indian

leader, Chief Crowfoot, and other chiefs and coun-V - ‘I

KAISER MUSTALOOK ‘ELSEWHERE FOR
SUPPLY OF TREES TO FELL.

-Former Emperor William II of Germany has

practically completed his woodman’s task on his

I own estate. The imperial woodchopper must go.
elsewhere if he wants to take his favorite exer-
cise of felling, sawing or chopping wood.

" In his labors onpthe Hohenzollern estate, now
covering a period of about eight years, the for-
mer Kaiser was careful to remove only dead
trees or such as hampered o‘thers.in their growth
or destroyed the symmetry of his park.

It takes half an hour_at a brisk pace to walk
‘ around the whole estate, which is enclosed by a
high wire fence surmountedby barbed wire.

Dr. John H. Barry, ‘Sanitary Superintendent of
Queens, announced yesterday that he had. as-
’ signed a corps of his inspectors to compel owners
to out down ragweed growing on their premises,
and had revived old notices warning residents to
’ kee the weeds from blooming. .
’T is intensive campaign against the ragweed
is an’,attack upon hay fever, Dr. Barry says.
_ The weed is considered very aggravating to hay
— fever patients. .All is well, the Superintendent
 says. if the plants are kept from blooming, but
. if they blossom and the pollen gets into the air,
. -hay fever victims will suffer more. -
Hay fever clinics are being formed throughout
 ._ the city, accordin to Dr. Jules L. Blumenthal,
Director of the hild Hygiene Division of the

he said, “and that it was up to my fathervto say, ~
‘Yes.’ or ‘No.’ My father had called him in rm-‘

OUR “HOT DOGS” TH,REATENEl)_.
A vision of a nation of “hot dog"'eaters is sug-
gestedzby the statement that,_viscose coverings
rovided for 75,000 pounds of ayuenies per day are
msuﬂicient to. meet the deman ‘. And this is from
but one company. i , l _
 The manufacture of ce_llulose sausage casings
miss reoeivedxadded impetus, morevoer, with the
Ego-every that the smoking and cooking of sau-
‘sages ‘in a factory does not in any way affect the

veritable “shirtless sausage.” _ _

The viscose used for sausage coverings 1S made_
from cotton linters, and because of the high con-‘
tlentiof viscosity pumping andvfiltering has been
ggfdiﬁicult that very small batches only have been
"r.oducedlat a time. After ripening, the viscose

here is every reason to believe that the hot‘ dog
