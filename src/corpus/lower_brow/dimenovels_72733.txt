- George Fox, and Bart Day were schoolmates
at the same grammar school before they entered

a Wall Street‘ as messengers for, Nelson Decker’

and‘ Heath & Co.—, respectively. p -
They lived; in the same block on 127th[ street,
near Lenox ‘ave_nue——George ’ Fox with his
widowed mother and a sister two years his senior
who had lately become a school teacher; Bart

Day with his fathers and mother, anda small ~ ’

colony of younger brothers and sisters. Both boys
were as bright, as two new dollars fresh from

the mold, and were considered by their‘ employers l V
e as the smartest messengers in the Street- ’ ‘ \

They had always been chummyfrom the‘ time
they first became acquainted,.; and this feeling a
strengthened with the lapse of time. Bart's fa- ,

i‘ - “I see that I will have the handling of ‘the -A. this afternoon,” andli

money,” he said. “Want me to ﬁle a bond?”

“You’re honest enough to suit me.”

“Thanks, old chap. I entertain the same opin-
ion of you. When will you have your ﬁfty ready?
There’s a good chance now for me to make a deal
in R. & A. It’s going up, and I think it's a
chance we oughtn’t to miss. Nothing like making
a good start. . Theysay that’s half the battle.”

“I'll fetch the money over after supper. I’ve
got‘ it in my trunk.”

“All right. I’ll get around to that little bank in

Nassau Street some time in the morning and buy.

ten shares of R. & A. on margin. If it goes up
five or six points more I'll cash in. That will give
usa proﬁt of $50. Now my idea is not to divide
up our winnings until we make a respectable
stake, for the more working capital we have the
~ morewe stand to. win.”
“Or lose. Don't‘-forget ‘that. This is a game of
chance we’re going into, with the chances rather
against us.” v‘ '
“Do you agree not

to talk of dividing the ‘profit

I .for~six.»inonths at least?” .

‘ “Sure, if there is any proﬁt.”

“Oh, I feel it in my bones that things are going I

to come our way.“ .

“Glad to hear it._ Wish I could feel it in mine;-
but maybe your‘bo_nes are more sensitive than
mine,” chuckled Bart. ‘. .
~ The boys talked over the new partnership for
a while longer and then Bart went home; after
declining an invitation to remain to supper.
George Fox carried the ﬁrm’s capital——one him-
dred dollars-—<lown~town with him next morning.
Bart Day‘ accompanied him, for the boys nearly
always went to .Wal1 Street together in the morn-

. ;;i"ng, though they did not always return together.

‘At ten o’clock Mr. Decker called Fox into his
room and handed him aynote to deliver to a broker
in the Astor Building. On his way back the young
messenger slipped up to the little bank and put

the ﬁrm’s deal through. R. & A. was going at

'75, and that was the‘ ﬁgure Fox bought it for.
_That -afternoon, -while Fox was waiting in an
oﬁice to deliver a note hehad brought to the head
of the ﬁrm, he heard a group of brokers talking

. .v , about the rise in R. & A. One remarked that he

_had heard that there was a syndicate behind it.

.1

“If that’s true,” replied one of the others,‘ “it's

likely to go to 90 or eyen“ higher.” p
“I wo,u1dn’t.be surprised,”,said the first speaker.

‘ ‘ “I’ve bought 3,000 shares on a spec.”
, _ »."“I think’ I’ll buy some. too. ‘It’ looks good,”-
* chipped in a third broker.

“‘You’d‘better lose no time, ”
man, “for I think it’s getting scarce.

then,” said’rthe',ﬁrst*

“If it's getting scarce I should- take that “as a '

‘ , sign that somebody was cornering it.”

That is all _Fox heard, but it was eno_ugh_to give
him renewed conﬁdence in'the ﬁrm’s investment,
and he’ came to the conclusion that he and Bart
could afford tortake a longer, chance on it than
oints that «day, and closed at 77. Both boys
tiv_e offices. They got off work that day at about
e time and went uptown together.

“I thinkso, too. If it should go to 90 we'd‘ make
$120. That would _more than double our capital.’
_Well, use your Judgment about selling. I'll be

The ,boys then opened up their afternoon paper

his own account. When Fox went to his quick-
lunch. house he found Bart there perched on a
stool at the counter. George took a_ vacantstool
beside him and punched his partner in the ribs to
let him know he was there.

“Hello, George,” said Bart. “What do you
think of the market today?”

“On the seesaw-up and down. I’ni waiting; to

; hear of the announcement that L. &-M. has ac-

quired control of the P. & N. That will start the
stocks booming.”
“Bet your life it will.

“I hope we’ll make enough to run our capital
up to $1,000,” said Fox, after he had called for
a beef stew. ‘

“Gee! That would be ﬁne.
for fair then.”

“Oh, $1,000 isn't so much,” said Fox carelessly;

We’d be capitalists

l“but it’s a good thing to have, for ‘we could buy

100 shares of a stock. and then we’d make $100
every time the stock advanced a point. I wish we
had $1,000 up on this deal.”

Next morning the ﬁnancial papers, and the
,Wall Street page of the regular dailies hinted at
the probability of some kind of a deal between
L. ‘& M.» and P. & N.‘ That brought more outside
speculators to the Street, and -business was rush-
ing all day, both boys being kept on the Jump. It
had the ‘effect of boosting P. & N..up to 63, L. &
M. several points, and other good stocks in pro—
portion. The entire‘ Street now took it for grant-
ed that an announcement of some kind was to be
expected from the L. & M. road, and there was

. heavy bu ing of the stock. of that road, and also
’ of’ P. &

No official disclosures were made that
day, however, but P. & N. went to 65.

“It’s about time something came out, isn't it?”
said Fox when he met his partner that afternoon.
“What’s the use of holding the news back_ when
the papers are discounting it and everyone is sure
that some kind of an arrangement has been put
through?” , .

. “The announcement will be made when the L.

', & M. people see ﬁt to make _it. They are of, course

loading up with the stock of both roads, and when

they have got all they ‘want they will let the cat .

out of the bag,” replied Bart. .
“Things are pretty lively now. I’ve been on the
hustle all day.”’

“Same with me. The clerks have got to work

overtime tonight in our oﬂice.”

. “Dito at our place, butthat doesn’t/affect us.
‘We are out of it till tomorrow morning.” .
0 The‘ general boom in the market continued with

‘l the opening of the Exchange next morning. About

,»noon'the cluirman rapped for ‘order, and then
came the expected announcement from‘ the L. &
'M. people, but no- one had looked to hear that the

road had practically acquired ‘control over the-

P. & N. As soon as the chairman ﬁnished the

‘-“scale than before. _

of the robbery. The dapper—1ooking clerk who
had shouted “Stop thief!” asked him what he
wanted.
"I want to see the gentleman who lost the pock-

" etbook here a while ago," said Fox.

The clerk gave him.a sharp look.

“What do you want to see him about?”

“The pocketbook." ’ _
“Say,,are you the boy who ran away during the

excitement outside?”

“I am.”

.::Did"y,ou take, the pocketbook with you?”

“1\\7TV0hat did you run away for?"

“The wallet was dropped in the scrap my

friend and I were having with the thief. One of '

the men in the crowd that gathered about us
picked the pocketbook up and started off with it.

pl saw him do it, and I ran ‘after him to get it

‘away from him.” , ~
.-“Oh, you did?” replied .the clerk doubtfully.
“I did. I followed him into a building on

, Beaver Street, and after a good deal of trouble
' I recovered the wallet."

“Then you've got the pocketbook with you?”
said the clerk, opening his eyes.

“I have.” '
_ “Let me have it. please. - We all thought you
‘had run off with it, though your friend insisted
that you had not; but his statement didn’t count
for much, since he couldn’t explain why you ran

1 away. The fact that the pocketbook couldn’t be

_ found anywhere was against ou.”

opening it and counting the contents.

Fox watched him a bit, anxiously, for if any of

the money was missing it might look bad for him-;

To his great ‘satisfaction the money proved to be

, all there.‘

“It’s all right,”‘said the clerk. “We'are much

“No. I’m going to stick toour bargain. _ I’m
so satisﬁed with the results the ﬁrm has achieved
that I want to keep right on in the same. groove.”

-The money was locked up in the box and the
boys separated. When Fox got back to the oﬂice

, he, found the waiting—room deserted. After the

G. 8: H. rise‘ and theslump that followed when
the syndicate had unloaded on the public and such
brokefs as were dyed—in-the-wool speculators, the
market had taken on a wobbly look and custom-
ers stayed away from the Street. Mr. Decker was

in his (oﬂice engaged with a visitor, who pres-

ently came out and ‘went away._. Harv.-ily had he
disappeared before a man came in whom Fox rec-
ognized, as the person who had gone into the bear
pool with his boss. His name was Bragg, and he
looked just now as if something disagreed, with
him. . ,

“I want tovsce Mr. Decker," he said in a sullen

I tone to the boy. .

,“I’ll tell him you are here," said Fox, going
into the private oﬁice. ' '

Mr. Decker looked annoyed when his messenger
announced Bragg, but told the boy to admit him.
Bragg was then shown inside and soon Fox heard
high words in the little room,

"‘Something‘ is wrong between.

At that »moment there was a crash in the pri-

the boy's ears." That settled it. He believed that

it was his duty to go in’ and see what was going

heopened the door and looked in.‘ B.ragg_had- Mr.
Decker, chair and all, down, on the floor, and
while he was holding the broker by the throat

scene anyytoo soon. ‘The broker had been half

“Sure of that?” asked his partner.
“Yes.” .
"All right. Wait here till I come out.”
Bart waited. ‘
“We'll buy 5,000 shares of B. & L.,”‘ said Fox
when he rejoined his chum outside. ‘‘I’ll take you
into the safe deposit vaults, give you $50,000 and
you can go to the little bank and put in your
order for the ﬁrm. You’ve got time to do that
while I haven’t.” L . » _
B “That will be a big order for the bank,” said
art. .
‘.‘Sure. -The clerk ought to take his hatoif to
you,” laughed Fox. '
Bart got the money, went around to the bank
.and bought the stock at '74.’ The price went up
almost immediately to 76, about which it hung
for a couple of days, and then jumped to 78. On
the first of the following week one of the biggest
booms of the year started in the market, sending
all stocks up, and particularly B. & L. Hundreds
of lambs came to the Street with their boodle,
-prepared to make a small fortune, and "just as
conﬁdent as ever that they would do it this time.
Day by day the excitement increased in the Ex-
change. Bart made no further attempt -to ﬁnd
_8. job, but haunted the galley and kept a. sharp
eye on the stock in the firm’s interest.
Fox never was so busy in his life before, as
Decker was in with a pool to boom some stock,
while other booms were under way, too. Bart

thought he had never seen somuch excitement be-‘

Finally at quarter of two the

things looked awfullyticklish, but as he wasn't

i . sulted a pile of memoranda.

“Sold at 101 3-8,” he replied, returning to

“Thanks,” said Bart. i v‘
Then he made a rapid mental calculation and

“Gee! But that's tip-top!” he breathed, feel-

that all hands had heard about the matter. Fox
took his seat and began to think over the future
prospects of the ﬁrm of Fox & Day. It afforded

him a lot of satisfaction to think that his mes-
sengerdays were practically over for good. He

also rubbed his hands when he thought how sur-.

rised his companions in. the oﬁice would be to

earn that he had gone into the brokerage busi-

ness on his own hook. .

Decker’s failure proved to be so bad that he
announced that he would have to retire from
business, and arrangements were begun to wind
up his affairs. In the smeantime Bart had found
what he considered a suitable oﬂice, andihe took
Fox around to the building and showed it to him.
At ﬁrst the agent objected to renting it to the

boys, but when Fox said they were prepared to .

pay six months’ rent in advance he consented, and

they took possession of the office.‘ As Fox intend-

ed to stand by Mr. Decker as long as he wanted
his services, which would not be for long, he left
the furnishing of the office to Bart. The junior
partner bought two desks, a big rug, a safe, half
a dozen chairs, and other necessary furniture.
Theproudest moment of his life, however, was
when the painter had ﬁnished lettering the door

with the following sign:

FOX & DAY,
‘Stocks and Bonds.

He stood outside in the corridor and feasted his
eyes on it. - ‘ I

“Gee! I always said that would look ﬁne, and
it certainly does—ﬁner than silk. I must invite

my people down to visit us. They should be proud.

to have a real live stock brokerin the family.
The knowledge ‘will come to them as a great, big
surprise. I’ll bet my old, man will have a ﬁt.
Why, I could buy him out a hundred times over.
I-Ie’ll wonder how George and ‘I managed it.” .

Bart laughediquietly to himself" as he walked \

into the office, shut the door and took his seat at
his own desk. For the next hour he gave himself

up to castle-building and then he was disturbed‘

by the entrance of Fox. .

“In business at last, eh, old man?” said George. I

“I should smile but what we are,” replied Bart

complacently.

“Well, you’ll have to look after things for about i

a‘ week and then I’ll be with you. I guess during
that timeyou won't have anything more strenu-
ous to do than to keep abreast of the market. If
a customer should happen in don’t let him escape
you.” . ‘ .
“You can gamble on it that he won’t get away
if I have to tie’ him to a chair,” laughed Bart.

Bart had an easy time of it for the next ten ,
_ days.

In fact,” as the market was dull after the
late panic there was little to attract him over to
the Exchange.

At the end of that time Decker , H i

 It seemed almost too absurd in theireyes, but

“So you two boys have an office and an alleged

fycome down some time this week and satisfy my-

was astonished at the business-like appearance of

Bart’-had said was true, and so when the young
broker got home himself he found that he_was
every important personage in the family circle,
andithat even his father too-k his hat off to him,
metaphorically speaking. Some boys under the

but Bart wasn’t built that way, and took his new

‘ My name is Jere Baxter,” said the visitor.

‘_Glad to ‘know you, ‘Mr. Baxter. Take this

up. What can I do for you?”

“Do you deal in mining stock?”

,.‘jVVe haven't as yet, but it is in our line. Have
you any for sale?”

f‘I have 10,000 shares of the Phoenix Copper
Mine, of Phoenix, Montana, I’d like to sell,” said
the caller, pulling a big envelope out of his
pocket. and taking out a couple of certiﬁcates,
good for 5,000 shares, each, and laying them on
Fox's desk. The boy_took them up‘ and looked
at them, Then .he. picked a market report of
listed mining_ securities out of a pigeon-hole of
his desk and consulted it. The Phoenix Copper
Company was quoted at ﬁve cents a share.

“What do. you want me to do with these? Sell ‘ ‘

them for you?”

“Yes.”

“The stock is quoted
not follow that I will be able to get that for
you. If thereis no particular demand for this
stock I shall probably have some trouble in sell-
ing these certificates at any price. If I can’t get

. o. . =. .
g The visitor looked disappointed. The fact of
the matter was he had visited a number of
brokers, some of whom‘ had been willing to handle
the stock on a commission and some had not.

There was hardly any market for Phoenix Cop-
per, and the_brokers had told him that the pros-
pect of getting rid of the shares wasinot very
encouraging. N , y y . '

‘fI’ll take $100 for the shares,” he said. “I need

,money badly.“ That is one-tenth of what I paid

at ﬁve cents, but it does

for them. Some day they may be valuable, but I ,

I can't wait for developments in the mine.”

“Let’s buy them on a spec?” suggested Bart:

l“0ne hundred dollars wpn’t break us.” ‘

‘.‘All right,” said Fox. “We’ll take a. chance on

them at that, but if we have to frame them in the‘

end they will be rather expensive ornaments.”
He made out a. memorandum_ bill of sale, and

while Mr. Baxter was signing it he went to the

safe, opened it and took, $100 out.

“Thank you,” said their visitor. “I hope you’ll _  .

make -something out of them.” , .
He got up, bowed to the boys andptook his de-

parture. I I » ~ ' a
“Go down to

Bart departed on his mission. He returned in

about half an hour. ,

“I guess we’re stuck on that stock,” he said.

“Couldn’t sell it, eh?” said Fox.

“Half a dozenlbrokers told me that Phoenix is

dead proposition.” _

“Then it ought to be taken oif the market list."

_ “It might just as well be, for nobody seems to
want it.”

K “Our first customer didn’t pan out very well,”

Achuckled Fox.

“I suppose it’s my fault, as I told you to buy
the stock. Hand me the shares and charge $100
against my account,”, said Bart.

“No. The firm can stand the loss easily
enough; but we can’t afford to" make a steady
business of buying dead shares."

Fox put on his hat and said he was going over
521 the Exchange to see how things were moving

ere. -

V “‘I'll ‘keep house till you get back,” replied
‘Bart, taking up a copy of that morning's Wall

treet “News” and throwing himself back in his

c air.

That afternoon about half-past four, while’ Fox
was standing near Herald Square, watching the
ﬂow of ladies. who were going in and coming out
of a big department store nearyat hand, he no-
ticed a pretty young lady coming along with sev—‘
eral bundles in her arms. They were not large
buzidles, but about the size that ladies‘ carry

‘ when they are out ‘shopping. Not every pretty
girl that the young broker encountered in the

.. course of his walks attracted-Fox. Pretty girls
.are. so thick in New York that they are to be

' met with on every hand, in the shopping district
especially, so that it would keep one busy admir-
ing them all. There was a winning expression on
the face of this particular girl that made Fox

-' regard her with unusual interest. ‘

She stopped on the edge of the curb near him
and appeared to ‘be waiting for a break in the

'numero1.is vehicles passing up and down Broad-
way so that she could cross. An opening came
-at last andshe started. A ‘few yards out one of
her bundles dropped and she stooped to pick it
sup, whereupon a second. package fell and she had
to reach for that, too. At that moment an auto
came humming along down. The chaulfeur had <
.tur}ied to speak to the gentleman in the seat be-
hind and did not notice that he was bearing right

, down on the young lady._ Fortunately for her,

‘ Fox saw her peril, sprang forward, seized her
around the waist and swung her aside just in the
‘nick of time. The girl uttered a suppressed scream
and -stood trembling as the young. broker released
her. ~ 9'

V “I beg your pardon for handling you so rough-

» 'ly,” said Fox, raising. his hat; “but under the
',circumstances it was 'unavoidable."_ She turned
5her frightened eyes on him, but said nothing.

_ ‘.‘Will you permitme to see you across?” he said V

~ deferentially. She yielded ‘submissively to his

,escort, and they were~soon standing on upper

hatagain and starting to move off when she laid

CHAPTER XI.-—The Joke That Didn't work. 

Next morning Fox told B-art about the inéidmit, ‘
on“upper Broadway. . a 
'You_ ought to have got her address, George,’’.',,
said his partner. “Very interesting 
ending in marriage, have been the result of"meet—

Bert laughed
and the subject was changed to the market.- Oné
morning about a _month later a paragraph 
peared in a ﬁnancialgpaper to the effect that V ‘
Wa'ldh_eim interests had acquired the Phoenix ‘Cop-I
pe_r Mine, and intended to exploit it in connection .,
with their other coppenproperties. ‘Bart saw the "
paragraph and called his partner’s attention to it."
“Looks as if there might be something doingin
that property after all,” he said. . . ‘ ‘
“I should say ‘so. _The .Waldheims control’ 511'”

are multi-millionaires, and are pretty sure to
bring the Phoenix into, notice in some way, V _ _
as a gambling proposition. I wouldn’t sell those

“You wouldn't, and we ,.only gave a cent a, share
for them?” ejaculated Bart. . _ V a 7/. ‘ .  _
“> I.wouldn’t. Go down on the Curb and

i'  “Do you want me to make an investigation
around the Curb?” a
. \ “You might as well. You are not overbur_ ened »
' with work at this moment.” Bart put on his hat
I ‘ and went out. The fact that two boys had rented
Room 605 on the sixth floor of the Skye Building,
and were trying to carry on a brokerage busmess,.
attracted some attention from the tenants on that
ﬂoor. The clerks particularly COI‘lS1de1'ed‘the mat-
:. 1;er' quite a joke, and made a whole lot of fun‘
“ over it among themselves. ,
. “Some people in this world, have an ‘ awful
V “gall,” remarked Ed Waterbury, margin clerk for
the brokerage ﬁrm next door to Fox & Day, to
Wthe second bookkeeper.
V‘~‘That's What they have,” answered the other.
i “I suppose you refer to the kid brokers next
J —  course. Who else? Those chaps make me
i  tired. They ut on as much style as though they ,

" “I don’t see how the agent came to rent them

“Probably he thought their money

“You don’t imagine they have much money, do

E ()“§They must have some or they‘ couldn't keep

‘ “~‘When we come back from lunch let’s go in

turned the tables on Waterbury.

“I said that I did not do business with boys. 

It is contrary to the rules of the Street,” Fox
replied. ‘

“Who in thunder are you calling a boy?”
snorted Waterbury, getting red in the face. ‘ _

“Why, you’re one, aren’t you?” Waterbury
sported a mustache and prided himself on hm
manly appearance. To be called a boy knocked
his ‘self-esteem into a cooked hat. ,

“Why, you young monke ”

“Hold on!” exclaimed Fox,» swinging around in
his chair and facing the clerk with such a reso-
lute expression that he stopped short. “You may
not -look exactly like a boy, for you. have what
seems to be a mustache and your shoulders are
padded to improve your gure; but people are

“You are an insulting jackanapes, do you know
that?” roared Waterbury shaking his ﬁst at Fox.
“If you were a man I might take oﬂ’ense at
your language, but as you do not appear to have
any claim to that distinction ‘I will overlook your

then and there. There was a certain aggressive-~
ness underlying the young broker's cool manner
that warned the margin clerk not to go too far.
But what he dared not do with his hands he did
with his mouth. . He threatened Fox with dire
consequences for insulting him. He’ referred to

enjoyed the performance exceedingly. He was
glad that he had not put his own foot into the
matter, for hepsaw that the young broker was
nobody’s fool. ‘He chuckled when he saw that

CI-IAP;I‘ER XII.-——In Which Phoenix Copper
Takes on a Boom. _

Bart reportdd the result of his mission to the
Curb market. He h-ad made inquiries about Phoe-

, nix Copper and found that it was going at 20
_' cents as the result of the published ‘announce-
"ment that the Waldheim Brothers had acquired

“And it looks as if it was likely to go higher,
too,” he said. “There was not a great deal offered
_ ‘at '20, and I heard one broker offer 5,000 at 25
’, cents, thoughl am not sure that any one bought
the shares, or any part of them.” —

,“We didn’t make suchia bad spec of it after
all,” replied Fox. “You have a right to pat your-
self on the back, for I shouldn’t have bought

, those certiﬁcates if you hadn’t suggested it.”
“I did it more because I felt sorry for the
, gman than because .I thought the stock wouldever
i amount to much. He said he needed the money,
r ,»-andihe looked it.”

_ “Sentiment is all right in its way, but it doesn't
go in business to any great extent. However,
sentiment in this case has turned. us in 1,900 per
cent. proﬁt, as you/say Phoenix is bringing 20
cents. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Waldheims

 worked it up to $1 a share, dumped their holdings
T on the public and then threw the mine overboard.
. }. They may on the other hand, ﬁnd the mine a
paying proposition in the ore line, and boom it
on iaﬂvlegitimate basis. In either case we’ll hold
‘ , on to what we’ve got and see how things even-

 tuate.” During the next, two ',weeks -Phoenix
. Copper adually went to 30 cents a -share, and
I Fox & ay could have sold their~10,000 shares

forjthat price, but Fox advised against it, and .

0“ what he said went with Bart. The ﬁrm had
, received a number of letters from people who
—. had seen their advertisement in the "ﬁnancial
papers. Bart answered these correspondents with

a. short market letter, which he had typewritten’,
 but nothing in other way of ‘business came from
Ti them.» Fox’ had been watchingthe market right

  

L along on’ the lookout for another chance to in-»

,fcreas‘e their 'capital if they were lucky. ’ The
chances forgetting hold of a tip under their
-altered circumstances were not very good, and
't «became a matter of judgment in the selection
.y’,of 'a winner.’ Finally’ Fox decided to invest in
" ' L. & M.,,which he noticed was lower than usual.
,  It was going now at 65. So he went to a. big
“ brokerage house andxboug*h’t_-10,000 shares of 1'9:

and so Fox put in his order. After the broker 1 '
who handled the deal had settled with them 
the ﬁrm of Fox & Day had a. capital of a qi'iar- I I
ter of a million stowed away intheir safe ‘de- 
posit box. Soon after this, while Bart was. walk-‘ 
ing up Broad Street, he noticed some excitement , 
among the Curb ‘traders. Inquiring into the, ’
cause of it he learned that a fine body ‘of copper  I
ore had been discovered in the Phoenix mine, and 
that the stock was taking on a boom. He hung a ~“
around for awhile and watched the price go up,,,
dozens of brokers offering advancing 3 ﬁgures,’
for the stock. Then he rushed back to the office" , --
and told Fox the news. ' ‘ . ‘ 
“When I left 45 was being ‘offered for Phoe-T,‘ '

of the 10,000 shares the ﬁrmihad in the safe and a
for which they had paid’ only $100 all told- ‘,‘I"ll  ‘

After getting out at Wall Street I discovered that

That seemed too provoking for anything, and I

However, I recollected that your oﬂice was in the

‘your office was and he said the sixth, Room 605.

‘ . ' “Do you wish me to hold it a while?” she asked.
, “I do. We have 10,000 shares of Phoenix Cop-

you shall have it all,” said the old gentleman. “I
will also recommend you around among my
friends.” Bart came in soon after the new cus-

-tomer went away, ‘and Fox told him about him.

“If we can catch Moses Elsgood as a steady
customer it will give us the biggest kind of a
boost in the Street. He is known all over the
ﬁnancial district, and there isn’t a brokerage
house but would be more than pleased to secure
his custom. I don’t know how he came to drift
in here, butihe seemedvto take ‘a fancy to me. He
asked me how long you and I have been in busi-
ness, and who we worked for before we started
out for ourselves. He also asked in a general way

if our capital was suﬂicient to keep us going.

Finally he gave me an order to buy him 10,000
B. & 0., to be delivered C. 0. D. at the Hanover
Bank. I'm going out now to attend to the order.”
“That’s a good order,” said Bart. ,
“It’s ayprime one. The best of it is he said he
if he found us

“We'll handle it or burst an artery,” replied
Bart.~ “A good thing like that must not be al-

" lowed to get away from us under any circum-

stances.” Fox went out to look for the stock
in some broker's oﬁice. By good luck he found
the amount of B. & 0. he wanted in the ﬁrst
place where he applied, and he requested that it
be delivered right away. Bart made outpand
mailed the statement of account to Mr. Elsgood,
and on the following afternoon they received a
note, enclosing check for commission, compli-
mentin ‘the firm on the promptness with which

r~.'.he or er‘ had been executed. After that the

old gentleman began dropping in every day to
have a chat with them, which indicated that he‘
intended to make their office his head uarters.
He brought a friend once in awhile, an in this
way Fox & Day began to accumulate a number

of customers. They hired an office boy, a budding

sitenographer making her ﬁrstbow in the business
During

instead of writing Miss Lane, Fox took the lib-
erty of calling on her at her uncle’s home. He

F used the rise in the copper stock simply as an

excuse for his call, but the girl appeared to be

. pleased to see him. He spent /a pleasant evening

with her, and she invited him to call again. Her
uncle had given up his ﬁght to get possession

"of her certificate, and peace reigned between the

rtirl and her relative. Fox adually became a
regular weekly caller, and egan inviting her
out to the theatre, or some other form of en-
tertainment. _One day Bart'overheard a party of
bro'ers talking about a corner that a powerful

' Somebody

‘nyndicate was working in O. & N. ‘ 1
on’ the inside had tipped one ‘of the brokers off

” _to ‘thesituation, and he was tlving‘ to form 3

pool among his friends to take advantage of his
in carrying the news

“This is the first tip we've got hold of since
we’ve been in business, ‘so it behooves us to make»
the most we can out of it,” he said to Fox. Eox
agreed with him, and as a result they managed

.. to secure ‘10,000 sharesyoftlie stock, though not
‘ - without difficulty, for it was pretty scarce. They

.ad- to pay an average price of 90 for it, but by

That meant a prospective proﬁt of nearly 525,- "

“No wonder fortunes are easily made in Wall
Street,” said Bart after he had noticed thead-
vance on the ticker. “All dyou have to do is ‘to
get on the right thing an then have the coin

to back it, and if things go right you gather the 

money in hand over fist.” 4
“And don’t ‘forget that fortunes are just aswv‘

easily lost as they are Won,” said Fox. “In fact, 9'

easier. Suppose we had the whole of our capital 
up on O. & N., and it suddenly dropped a dozen’ ‘
points, where would our money be? We’d be
ﬂat broke and have to begin all over again.” .

by this deal added the sum of $155,000 to their 3
capital, which now amounted to over $400,000.»:

On the day that Fox settled with his broker for. I
the O. & N. deal, Harry Smith called on.Foxfand-i-— 
invited him to take lunch at Delmonico’s. ‘After, '
the meal, while they sat smoking, acouple. ‘of '
high— riced Turkish cigarettes, which was a lux ,,
ury at Fox seldom indulged in, as he did not
believe in either smoking or drinking, Smith said "I 
to the young broker: ‘_‘I’m going to give you: 1
-a pointer, but you must kee it strictly to your 
self. You know Phoenix, opper, of course*?”, 
“Sure thing,” replied Fox; * ‘
“It is going around $1.35. Well, inside of
days it will drop to adollar at any rate.” , , 
“Will it?” said Fox with an air of interest.‘ 7' 
“Positively. Watch it. When it reaches a 
dollar limit buy all you can afford of it; Insi"

“Sure of that, are you?” ‘

TIRE WEAR TESTS

S°me 1'em9:f‘kal_>1S’ interesting tests have been ~. ‘-
made, says Scientiﬁc American, in order to deter- _ 0
mine the relative degree of‘ automobile tire wear» 0

on c_oncrete~roads as well as on good macadam

roads and very poor, rough macadam roads ;*also — 7
in order to determine how much the temperature ’ ‘

of the air affects tire wear.

Ilntthe. case of the Washington College tests, the ’ _
/chief object was to determine whether the, saving : _
"in fuel and tire were due to good roads warrants 

‘the increased! cost of such roads. Tire wear was
determined by removing the tires, with the rims,
from the cars, cleaning them thoroughly, deﬂat-

ing them and weighing them on a sensitive bal- it
ance. This was done both before and ‘after a t

test run. The average of the weight of rubber

worn from four tires was_ taken. Runs of fifty _ 1
to SeVentY-ﬁV_e miles‘ proved sufficient for decisive V

1 results, except on concrete roads. ‘~  _
It was‘_found that rubbers cuts more rapidly ,. .7‘
when _wet than when dry. It was also found that _ ,‘ _

the temperature oflthe air has a great deal to_do

with tire wear. One might expect a few per cent.’ .i »'
increase in wear, due, for example, to the ;~ise~‘:...

in temperature from that of a frosty morning to a7 .
hot noonday; but the rise of about 700 per cent. 

is a distinct surprise.

Speed, on 'the_other hand, does notlbring about ‘ ,

as great a difference in tirewear as temperature

does.-‘ Take. f0r'é3=amp1e. a sprint? ‘day at 66. 1" ’
degrees Earenheit. At ﬁfteen miles perghour ’ 0
the wear is about .22 po_unds.per tire per 1,000.1 _.
miles; Increase your “speed to doubleé-étliirtyiy 

miles pei-vhour—-and the, wear only increases to 1'5

about‘  pounds per tire for every 1,000 miles‘,

. TURNED AWAY

——- OR —- ‘
A BOY IN SEARCH or HIS NAME

 

By GASTON GARNE

(A Serial Story.)
CHAPTER III.

Nameless.

The boy ate his supper almost in silence, for the
housekeeper, usually garrulous, seemed moody, or
had something on her mind, for she said very
little, and answered only when addressed.

Having ﬁnished his supper, Clif walked to the
window; parted the heavy draperies, and looked
out. - 

A vivid ﬂash of lightning illumed the sky ‘for

an instant, and he saw the sea white with foam,
and heard the roll of the thunder, the whistling-of
the wind, and the roar of the surf.
‘ “Tom was right,” he mused. “There’s a storm
coming, sure enough. I wonder how he knows
these things? I can read weather signs, but not
as he can. Simple as he seems, he knows much"
more about some things than the best of us.

The noise of the surf grew louder, the thunder
when it came was more terrifying, the wind whis-

’ . tled ‘more shrilly, and the lightning was brighter

and more frequent.

Clif turned from. the window and left the room,
to go to his own study on the top ﬂoor of the great
roomy house,, where there were windows on three
sides, and heicould witness the storm to the best
advantage. I‘ .

As he neared the library door, which was open,
he heard his father’s step on the hard wood ﬂoor,

and stopped to look in.

“Clifton,” said the man, sternly, “come in. I
want to speak to you.” ' . ,

, Clif entered, and his father, standing on the op-
posite side of the great carved oaken table,
brought his ﬁst down upon it and said:

“What is this I hear? You have been acting
like a bully and a braggart, and have brought’
shame and disgrace u on me. What‘. explanation
have you to offer? .‘ at one can you oﬁfer?”

“I must wait till, I know what you have heard,

“You insulted and struck the son hf’ the most

“I punished the bully who was torturinig; a poor,

, ‘V szilly boy who had only»re‘tailated when set upon
' by Hare

Wintringham andhis cronies.”

“You ruck him ﬁrst and unprovoked.”

“No, sir, I did not. I threw him off when he
:‘nd,Claude Worthington were holding Tom’s head

under the pump. I did strike him when he uttered

insults that no gentleman would brook.”

}‘You provoked a fight in the public streets, and
must make an apology.” _ _
" Cl1f’s face turned ashen, and for an instant he

i felt‘ as if hisstrength would fail him.

  

- “Not satisﬁed withithat,” continued Mr- How-

’ -ard, "you wilfully destroy h_is property,’ run down

“Who has told you these lies, father?” asked 
Clif. “Harold Wintringham violatedthe rules, of " ~

him, and we fouled and he lost his bowsprit and I .

ly attempted to run me down or throw _me,on,thev \ :-

“Persons who,saw the affair say that you fouled '
him purposely and without reason.”

“Then they lie, and are this feI1ow’s tools. * You ~
never knew of my telling-‘a lie in all my life, and ‘_ ‘%
I will not do it now. Harold Wintringham first. 
insulted me most grossly, and then attempted to ' .

he says otherwise he only proves himself» the"‘li,_ar
I sai he was.” , s ' 2 V .,
“You must apologize to him"at once,” said’-Mr. ' a
Howard, furiously. ,» .‘ .9.

“You have not heard the truth, sir,’ and I can. . 
not apologize and preserve my self-respect: When. gif
you learn the truth, you cannot’ force me to ‘so . 
humi11ate,_ so degrade myself.” , ‘ p '

“You will apologize or leave my house onceqa d‘ I
forever!” stormed the man, striking the «tab is .
furiously, his face ashen withrage. “I vaminj
debt to‘ Wintringham; he-can ruin me if he wishes, 
and will unless you apologize to his son. I am not’, ~
nearly so rich as men believe. In fact, I sha.ll‘b,'e"
beggared, lose all unless you apologize.” ,1, A

“Better lose fortune than honor!” said Clif. '‘I‘
would rather be a. beggar in the streets than to *
disgrace myself in the eyes of every decent, s;elf~ 
res eating man.” ' p ' ‘ “N

‘ ou must!” shouted Mr. Howard,.in a rage‘.

“I will not!” said Clif, in a low, tense tone‘. "No,"
sir, I cannot apolo ze and be able to look,,any'
honest man in the ace afterward. Do you 
what Harold Wintringham called me? He said’ I
was a nameless cur, a nobody’s brat, that I was
not your son. Shall I apologize to him for that???

“You must_!” fairly shrieked Mr. Howard, “or
I shall be ruined. «It is the only thing thaticazi
save me. You mus , you ‘shall do it,” and the man
seemed to have become a maniac in an instant. "

_“A_.nd I say I will’ not!” said Clif,.in a clear,
ringing tone, heard above all the din of the storm.
“Better ruin than shame and dishonor.” , ‘

At this moment the storm seemed to have burst
forth in all its fury. ‘ .' » 1 - 1,

“You won’t?” hissed Mr. Howard, his eyes
aﬂame, his ﬁngers twitching, and a thin foam ap-_

 

 

   
  
    
   
 
   
  
   
   
  
   
  
 
  
  
  
 
  

“Then go!" screamed the man, losing ‘alllifycbiié
trol ofhimself. “I don’t know how young. Wing,-
ringham knew, but hespoke the‘ truth. You care
not my son; you have not one drop ‘of my blood
in your veins. .You were adopted at my wife's,

you? I gave you a home, an education, brought .

‘iwherehe had known so many (fileasant hours, and

“neither knew nor cared whither he _went, but sped

ly, but Clif could always tell when they had gone .

farenough in one direction, and would ease up
the sheet and look after the sprit at the very mo-

 inent that Tom was ready to shift his tiller.

Sometimes the lightning guided him, sometimes
the sound of the waves, sometimes the wind, and

' . sometimes a gesture from Tom, but he was always

' ready, and did his perilous duty bravely.

It was best to go well past the reefs at ﬁrst,
so as to run in on their lee, and so work around
togthe point where the boat was held by the rocks,

but Clif knew that Tom understood this as well»

as. he did, and so he wasted no time in trying to
give directions. ~
At last they passed to the weather of the Skil-

let, and by the glare of the lightning could see
‘the boat still fast,, her sails gone, but her mast
still standing, andthe two imperiled castaways,
'whom Clif now easily recognized as Ada and her

father, clinging to this as'they crouched on the

. deck. _
“Hold out a little longer!” the boy shouted,

knowing that the wind would carry the sound of
his Xoice to them. “We’ll get you as soon as we
can.

They kept on, and presently wentabout, running
with a reefed sail‘ and a free wind toward the
sheltered side of the reefs, Tom ‘minding his helm
with the utmost care, and Clif holding the sheet
line so as to be ready to let go at a moment’s
warning. — ' ,

It was raining again, and the lightning was less
frequent, but there was still considerable wind,
and the waves ran high; so that there was great
danger of their being swamped as they ran in

f ‘toward the rocks. —

At length Tom gave a quick twist to the tiller,
and sent the Polly under the lee of a great round
rock on the edge of the Skillet. Clif let go his

 sheet, loosed the halliards, and gathered in the

sail as they glided into a quiet cove where they
coulltll feel nothing of the storm, though they heard
it a . '

‘ “Good!” said Clif. “So far we are all right.

Do you know where

“Yes,” said Tom. “Pass that sheet once or

twice around the sail sols to hold it an’ I’ll work

her in with an oar. Hold the light close
gunnel when I tell you.”

In a few moments Tom was working the Polly
through‘ a narrow channel between the rocks, Clif

to the

‘V i holding the lightlow so as to guide him.
 {Before long they saw the wrecked boat again,

and were able to work their way to within a few
-feet of her bow. ‘ _

fiorward, with the lantern swung over one shoul-

Tom Brown’ assisted Mr. Kidder to ‘reach the,‘

ya_wl, and the father and daughter sat on the mid-
ship thwart, while Tom at the tiller and Clif, at

the sheet, warped the Polly freeof the wreck, past .

the worst of the rocks, and then set out to sea. .

‘ It began to rain heavily now, and Clif put his. - 
oilskin coat about Ada, more to keep herwarm ~ S
than to protect her from the rain,‘ as she was al-. ; "

ready nearly drenched with the spray. ‘ _

They beat their way well clear of the Skillet, T;
and then went about and stood in toward shoije, 
the light in the old man’s cottage shining like a"L‘.V

star amid the darkness. .
Then all at once there came such a tremendous

downpour of rain that all things, were blotted out,

in an instant,‘and they drove on blindly until of

a sudden they beheld a vessel’s lights, and saw’
her great hull bearing down upon them, threaten- fl

ing to cut them in two and sink them. ’

“Ahoy, there!” cried Clif,_ springing on the for-  ..
ward deck and swinging his lantern vig'orously..  T

“Ahoy, there! throw us a line!”

Tom put his tiller hard down. at the same mo”
ment and swung to one side, but the schooner, as

she appeared to be in that uncertain light, 
down upon them, scraped the Pol1y’s side with‘ 
her cutwater, and would have swamped themhad , ‘

“Aye, aye!” rang out a voice from the deck,

  A PLOT FOR A FORTUNE .

A humble country cottage set far back from
the road, and a girl of eighteen standing by the
door, an open letter in her hand.

 

“MISS IDELIA GRAY:-——It is my sorrowful duty
to announce to you the death of your grandfather,
which brings his annuity to youpto an end.

“However, I have an offer to make you, and, as
the family lawyer, I think it is the best thing you
can do to accept it. Your father’s cousin, James
Gray, having lost his own daughter, offers you a
home with him. You are to bring the family jew-
els with you, if they are still in your possession,
and I suppose they are; also, all other proofs of
your identity as Idelia Gray. Respectfully,

“WILLIAM D.A.L'roi~z.”

Idelia Gray out over the green meadow that lay
in the distance, then her eyes came back to the
cultivated grounds around the cottage, then they
rested on a bustling; woman, busy weeding the
garden. '

“I am not wanted here, since she took’ poor
auntie’s place,” she thought, wearily; “I will ac-
cept my eousin’s oﬂer.”

The very day Idelia Gray received the letter,

two men sat talking in Law er Dalton’s private

room, one the lawyer himse f, the other James
Gray. '

“Yes,” ._Iames Gray said, “Mildred iswilling,
but do you think we can manage it.

»“Yes, there is no difficulty. I will lay the plan

I ‘before you in plain words.

 

“Your uncle, Ezra Gray; one of the wealthiest
men in the city, had a son_ who married without
consulting him a pretty, penniless country girl,
and when he told his father of his marriage he
was disinherited. Is that right so far?”

James Gray nodded. _

“‘Go,’ the father said, ‘and never enter these
doors again; but wait———’ as the young man was

turning away.

“He left the room, and in a few minutes came
ba_ck,.an iron-bound box in his hand. I

“ ‘These are your_mother’s jewels,’ he said; ‘she
left them to your wife, if ever you married. Take
them, but a penny of mine you -will never re-

» eeive.’

“Without a word théyoung man took the box

‘and left his father’s house forever—yes, forever—-

for he was killed in a railway accident the next

i‘lMY.
v "His dead body was found; beside it the iron-
bound box lying by his side. The officials recog-
nized him, and he was buried at his father's ex-
pense. _ '

“He sent the jewels to his son’s wife, however,

 gut showed no wish to hear either of her or from
S i 81'.

“When five years had passed away, she wrote

 to him.to tell him she *was~dying.

“He will marry Idelia now!” he said to himself;
“my wealthwill go to my grandchild, and to him
as well. I have every reason to be content, but
somehow I believed I would love George's daugh-
ter better than I do.”

F. Getz gook with him besideg iiiesctiindlnlibggﬁxid
elephant, two tigers, two leopards, a panther, 
occlot and a python snake thirty feet long. , ,-

He sent a telegram, to his housekeeper on ‘the’
farm near Holland, Mich., smeverything would be"
ready when he arrived. , ’ , _ '

Mr. Getz was once a small boy. Now he is sixty
years old, a_self-made millionaire and he has 1'39,
tired. Having a zoo all his own is,Mr., Ge,tz’s
hobby. ' ~ ‘I  1

One afternoon back in 1919, _Mr. Getz was sit».
ting on theporch of a hotel in Egy'p(t, fanning-
hnnself. His servant, out of a clear s V, and for

a parrot. Mr. Getz, who has never thought‘seri‘:-
ously about parrots before, thought he would._-_ ‘b
 The servant went to the shops, and, not ﬁnding
a parrot, bought a monkey. 1 k  ~
And this started Mr. Getz’s hobby—-a hobby
which now amounts to a menagerie of , some ".209.

camels, panther-s, ant eaters, alligators, snakes,
babboons-—and parrots. He keeps them on what:
he calls his ‘/‘farm’ out in Michigan..- The,‘ffariri€$
is really one of the most magnificent‘ country
places of the Middle. West. ' p ;  g j
- At his room in the-Waldorf—Astoi-ia 'Mr., Geti
said he had come, to New York to see about ﬂip
shipment, of animals he had picked_up the _laim
time he was in Singapore. The elephant was the
main tliing—-he didn’t have an elephant,» and't,lie

then the snake"—oh, he was a beauty. J
