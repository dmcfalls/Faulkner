 Captain Jake sauntered over to the newcomer
,..a,1Id‘.spoke to him. i. '

" Gunnion listened and then looked at Fred, whom
he sized up from head to foot. " ’

.At. ﬁr t he. shook his head, as if he objected to
, the arr gement, which rather surprised the boy,
as he.didn’t see how he hadany right to question
% anything that the captain approved of in conneo-’
-‘tion with the’ management of the boat.“ .
A ‘Ha:-low, however, seemed to have made up his
.. mind that he wanted Fred aboard, and after some
' .ar§I-Jment, Gunnion yielded the point.

“See here, my lad,” he said sharply, ‘as if he

“What do you mean by that?” asked Fred, sur-
prised‘ at his tone and manner, which did not
ieem to be in line with his standing on board the

oat. L ‘ _ ‘
- —“I mean‘ you must promise not to enter the

‘'‘you’ll sleep in the coop at the bows.” - .
_ T“If‘ that is Captain Jake’s'orders.of course I’ll
“obey them; but I should imagine it was his place‘
» to tell me what I’m to do and what I'm not to do,”
‘replied the boy, in a sturdy tone. ‘‘He’s the cap-
 of‘ the boat.” ' .

the skipper hastily stormed him. .

and you can get used to your -new bedroom before
we start; It’ll kind of break you in, and you’ll be
,_on' hand when; you’re wanted.” , ,

S The boy had noobjection to falling in with the
‘sk_ipper’s suggestion, and thanking Captain Jake
for‘giv_ing him the chance to get to the city free
of expense, he left the wharfftotbid some of his»
“old friends good-by, and get his few personal pos-

Several hours passed, and the sun was well up in  ‘

and then’ began pacing ‘the deck in the sunshine,~, H.
apparently at peace with himself and the World; l‘-., \
Dinnerlwas ready at half past-‘twelve and the ; “
boat cameto a halt so that the mule, not.the'  .

and he and the .boy get their dinner. Of course, ,
Fred had his dinner at the same time, and when  
the boat started once more he resumed his place W"/'9
at the tiller. It, was almost sundown when they , '
hauledvinto the basin at Rome, where they "were, 2.

when she got under way again. He gave Fred  .»
sundrydirections so that he would be able .120, '
ﬁnd the boat easily when he got back to the basin, ,
and the boy went ashore. He walked up“and. ,
down the principal business streets, then, buying‘ .
the evening paper, stepped intopa cheap restan-I’ *
rant to read it, calling for a cup of coffee and a
plate of crullers, though he was not at all hungry.
He‘ sipped’ the ’£:0i'Yee, inunched the ,crullers,‘and
feastedhis eyesoii the news. Suddenly his._.fa1'«-‘
tention was attracted by the storyeof a daring ,’
night robbery reported from the village of.Ghes-_
ter. When‘ he saw that the crime had beenpe
petrated in his native place he was‘ interested’ at
once. _, He was still more interested when he dis:
covered. that his late einployer,‘ Mr. _13axt_e1‘5;»\wa,s_. 
the victim of the outrage. He devoured the ac; 
count with great eagerness, for a robbery of any — -’
importance in Chester ‘village was something, ‘out’
of the usual. The story put him in possession, .
of the following facts: ‘  » '

‘and «made a bundle of a lot of other things he

,; eaving t e old man gagged'*and bound in—-bed.
», When ‘the’ old woman housekeeperappeared at
even next morning, she was somewhat surprised
. to see no signs’ of Baxter -about. He seldom
, failed to have the store 'open"at half-past six,
 and she always found e ﬁre in the stove started
' 7 ready for her, and the ettle boiling. She jumped
to theiconclusion that he might have been taken
grill during thp night, and she Went to the door of
 hisgroom to knock. She_ noticed that the door was
(partly. open," and looking into the room was
. astonished to see Mr.’ Baxter bound and gagged
 onthebed. Ge’tting‘a knife, she cut him loose, and
‘then the storekeeper cried out that he had been
robbed the night before, and pointinghis trem-
gbiing ﬁnger at the open safe. He hurried into
/ his clothes and rushed oil“ to the head ’con,stab1e’s
.'ho_use to tell him about the outrage.’ He described
., \,~the burglar as a man of average build, and he
thought he might be anywhere from twenty-ﬁve
to thirty-ﬁve years of age. He had worn a black
' , mask that completely covered his face, so_ Baxter
was‘ doubtful if he could identify him if he saw
Lhim again without‘ it.‘ That was the story Fred
; 1";-ead in «the Rome afternoon paper, and it aston-
: ’ ished him .not._ a little. It set him thinking,
_ too. He remembered waking up the night before
' 7‘ .éknd seeing Gunnion .- come aboard‘ the canal-boat
{ wata late‘ hour with a gripsack and a bag full of
- something. Then the words Captain Jake had
addressed to him- about his‘ma-king a haul, and

    
   
 
     
   
   
   
  

 

 

 

   
   
   
   
  
 
   
  
  
   
 
   
   
   
   
 

had evervdbne, occurred to the boy." And now
here was the account/of Baxter having been rob-
Vged the /night before, What Fred had seen and
, eard seemed particularly signiﬁcant in the light
~‘of,the./old man’s statement that the -‘burglar ap-
vgearged to be a man between twenty-ﬁve and
:, hirty-ﬁve years of age, and that he carried his
Jﬁlunder away in a bag and a gripsack.' The boy

gated to, give expression to his thoughts». It
.,1éoked'~.to him‘ as if Gunnion was the burglar and
-Captain Jake his accomplice,. He had known
, Harlow, in "a general -way, for more than a year,
..f and knew nothing bad of him, but that"was not
‘ ‘ ~ saying but the‘ skipper might be. crooked on the
_ ‘quiet. In view of the ‘present circumstances his
opinion of Captain’ Jake began’ to undergo a
change. . ’ , - i
J -."“I really believe he and Gunnion are hand-in-.
Tglove,-.:and_, unnion appears to. be the boss, other-.

As he looked around to see if there was apo-

‘V ﬁnd the‘ station-house, he was surprised to see
i unnion and Ca tain Jake comin up the street.
While he was ooking at them t ey turned into
" a saloon. The fact that both Gunnion and the
 skipper were away from the canal-boat put a bold
’ idea» into Fred’s head, and altered the plan, he
was about to carryout. ‘ ‘ ‘ ’
.  7Here was achance for him to return to the
' 5 " ‘boat andtry to get into the'cabin.in order to.
. sée if he could get ipositive evidence agamstthe
2 men. He was sure that the robbery of. Baxter’s
= house was not the only 'crime of its kind that
-,_ Gunnion had committed, consequently he felt cer-. V
tam that the cabin was the secret «repository of
"a‘c'onsiderable amount of plunder. The money
-part ha.d,—no doubt, been divided bet_ween'the men
"j-—.-the '-fact’ that he had "received the 'tel1—tale
‘mended bill from—C_aptain Jake wasgprett satis-
l"facto'i‘y evidence of «that fact; but, the res of the
' swag that Gunnion had accumulated was doubt-
. Bless hidden somewhere in the cabin, and by lo-
cating it Fred felt he would have the case
linched against the crook and his accomplice.

rather grated on l<‘red’s nerves. - H .

to act differently. _' . _ 4 _ _ _ _

sently attracted a couple of ladies. ,«

was so new that there was nothing professional
about-hismethod. 1 ' .

lieved in the article himself, and before he knew
it he"was selling them at a rate that promised to

really a winner-,,one sale leading to another. ‘

‘_ The result was that at one o'clock he sold the
l<ast,of«ihis stock, and could have disposed of sev—
*'.eral more if he had had them. Then he woke up,
as it were, from the atmosphere of business, not a

talking andrselling like a house a re. He waited
ten minutes till the crowd began to thin out and

'  , It was hard work for little pay, so a party of
them got together and pledging eachpother to pro-
found secrecy, they proceeded  buy up all the
‘iihages they could get of a certain,Western rail-

By the merest accident Bob learned that a
clique was buying up the shares, but he didn’t
' kxiovw‘who the members were.

\ He took the chances and bought up every share .

oating around the Street within twenty-four

.- .» ~ Of course, he did not buy individually, but
through the bank's broker. “
‘ ' Every member of the clique cautioned the oth-
"-“ers-to look out for the Wall Street ‘hoodoo, and
not let him get wind of what was going on.
But Bob had.,already' gotten the wind and
bagged great storms of it. - .
Gradually thexstock began climbing until it had
' ‘increased about $15 a share. ‘

cate had to take it in order to holdup the price

 When hehadiinloaded‘ ntirely, he remarked

 - ‘fellows were at theback of it he would tell them

. Vresting on it. ’

" “Look here, Bob’, did you have any of that

; , ' ‘,‘.Yes.; a big lot of it, but I got rid of it yester-

5 ~ day, _and now whoever is carrying it on'their

shoulders are actually staggering under the load.”

._.;Bob didn’t know that the man he was talking

all of them-chip in capital and p ace it in the

admirably. _ _  ~ ‘

A certain woman owned a b ock ofva.tliousa'1iii"
shares, -and when the manager of the’ blii‘id—'po"

im. . _ . ~. ,
Bob knew she was a-very wealthy woman. ' She’
assured him that before other parties could con’
trol the road by getting a majority-of the stqc
they would have to buy the shares she owned.‘
Now, Mr. Whiddon,” she said to_ him “I"_vév.,
been watching you ever since you became.‘ 
in Wall Street. I‘ don’t believe in the hooddo busi

are ‘on the market, and I know several parﬁgg 
who own large blocks-of it. I don’t’-:' care toss
my shares, for I believe that‘ by ho1ding,_.on~t
them I can force the others tovterms, but ._If,]1
you have control of them so as to help youlretai

up more.” ' ' ~ '  ' $3,

CITY WOMEN UNAWARE HOW FARVTI-IEYb ‘ 
W K .' T  2-.

There is a tradition that the healthful exercise?
walking came to us _from the country. There may, "
have been such a time, when, with the horses in";
harness in the ﬁelds, the member of .the’family 
who had to go to town on an errand, walked
three, four or ﬁve miles. Today the car "is.
brought out; and the dweller, on the 'far'm»does’
not even have to walk out to the well, since the -
house is piped for water. ' - A "

In_a city there remain many incentives’ for
walklng‘. The’ difficulty ;of parking -3.; car , in-
creases, and transit lines fall short of their pur;-‘
poses because they do not cris—cross to suit the

‘pedestrians’ occasions. V ' , - , ~'

So it isthe city woman who walks, block after
block, unconscious that when the dayfisvdone
she has walked several mi1es.~ Not, so often."-as
a man is she out merely for the exercise. . -Sheha
a definite shop inxview, and walks more -‘ than,
a man. The man swings off for a walkywith the
definite urpose of bettering his physical .» cond' ‘
tion, and) later boasts that he/has walked“ from

' the Battery to Forty—second Street.  ';- '

 

C‘I-IINES‘E_STAND BY FARM’-LIFE 5
Of -Chinab vast population at least‘80 per (Se
is classed as agricultural. The so'ciali.and»ec‘o;-‘

‘agriculture that the Chinese ‘themselves say, all
the inroads of modernism and the industrialifzaﬁ‘
tion of the larger cities have made little impre
sion on the majority of the people. .   ..
A survey, covering a full year's operation «of
150 farms in one of the most prosperous regions
of Central China, was recently conducted”by
Nankmg University. The average size‘, of‘, ’
farms surveyed was 4.9 acres. '4 pf
in China are often made of.m'ud. bricks, 'ﬂmixécl*"
-with straw or bamboo mats, held ~together-Vby
wooden straps. Farm implements, the survey
found, were primitive. ' ' . . j, ’
A touch of the naiveté that so often charac

was found to be nearly twice as much, ongth
