posed Rats; and Patsy’ made up his mind then and there
that Tufts, in  own way, was a far more dangerous

L ' criminal than Peters himself, for the reason that he was

’shrewder and sharper. V
It was evident that he was a man of education, and
that he possessed remarkable natural intelligence in ad-
_‘Adi"tio‘ri to it. i T i W "
i , The young assistant realized now that it was his duty,

atall hazards, to warn Nick Carter without delay of the » “

trap that had been laidefor anybody who followed. the
supposed Rats fromlthe building, for that it was Nick's

_' intention to follqw along behind him when he went out,‘

3 he did not doubt.

But how to warn him without attracting the attention

 of the others present in the room“, that was the problem.

NICK TAKES A Kano  rrna GAME. /‘

* Those who have followed‘ Nick Carter throughout his
career will remember that one of his accomplisliments was

that of an expert in the “lipgmoveme’nt”~ languacre, -such

as is taught in institutions for theydeaf and dumb.

‘ , - It wasgone of the things that his father had compelled

him to learnﬂwihile he was a youth, foriold Sim Carter
had known that it ould many times -be of importance in

the career his son had chosen. Nick had been sent’ to J
V is\uc/h an institution to acquire thé science, himself playing .
i the part of a deaf ,and dumbyouth all the time he was

there. 

’ . But the result had been ‘what the old detective desired’; ‘

Npiclchad come forth/from the institution, entirely_ppro-
jficient, and-. from that day onihe had been able‘ to read
iwhat. others were saying, by the movement of- their lips,
even though he could not hear Ia word that was being ut-
tered.»  .  ‘ " ’ =

When Tufts left Patsy to cross the room and carry on J
that whispered conference with the proprietor Nick had ,

watched him, and also the man to whom he was talking; 

and he had been so fortunately placed that he was able‘  v

to read everything that passed between the two men.

In that respect as the reader knows, hexwas mofe for-,. ‘at

tunate than Patsy himself, for the latter could only guess _
what had been said. »

But Nick Carter knew as well as if he had overheard

each word that was uttered, and for the beneﬁt of the - ‘K,

reader, we will repeht here what that conversation was.

Assoon. as Tufts had drawn Riordan aside he said to -T

him; . "-. _ V
“I_ corp‘: from°Peters, Riordan."  <

Tufts; and he replied at once:
“What word does Peters send to me?” 

“He told me to tell’ you that ‘when thebirds ﬂy home‘ ,.

at night, it is to their nests, and they don’t like-to have
hawks ‘hofverin_g( around them.’ ”.- ‘ a

“Good!” replied Riordan,’ smiling, but nevertheless
looking a bit uneasy, /for the stilted re ly had honveyved

 A STRANGE-

/’ V BY 1:. H. LEWIS.

NEW—YEAR’S CALL.

 

 

 

y . Teddy Walton kept a little store on one of the side
‘streets of San Franciscw ‘ - 1
T It’ was not of great importance, neither did his name
ﬁgureamong the merchant princes of the Golden Gate
' City,pbut it furnished income enough, to support Teddy’s
aged mother and himself, besides paying tuition of a

crippled brpther at the State college. _ ,
  The‘ business was that of stationery, newspapers, and
' other publications, andithe modest sign over the door of
the small shop stated‘ also that Edward ‘Walton con-
ducted a lending-library, wherp novels could be obtained
atthe uniform price of five cents per week.
_.Thi¢r latter scheme was not the least productive of
.-T,eddy’s establishment, as quite a number of peoplere—
.‘ siding, in that quartelr of the city patronized him.
' » His shelves" held a generous number of the latest nov-
"leis displayed in an attractive form; the “ﬁnding cata»
p-lpgfue” was always written up to date,’ and the youthful
proprietor was at all times courteous and willing to
xblige, so itisxnot to be wondered at that even some‘
of the older and eminently respectable neighbors called
"occasionally to satisfy their literary cravings. ‘
‘pAmong the latter was an oldman with snowy-white
fair and bentiﬁgure. C ‘I I _ '
.. ::He. was known on the street as Colonel Coates, and
 umor had it that his title was a relic of ancient “ranger”
, ;jBe*that as it may, he was a good cufstornzerlof Ted-_
' _dyds,,so when one day a servant called at the little 'store
‘with apolite .no_te, asking the young merchant to step
around to his house on the next street for a few mo-
"inents,fthe youth made haste to obey.  C
‘”Il’."Wa§ New-year’s morning, but in the genial climate
faf. California there was nothing in the outer aspect of
the'day to remind an Eastern manof the fact.
Snow was conspicuous by its absenoedland instead of

the cold, biting winds and ear—tingling blasts, a balmy '

‘irf sweptithrough the green foliage of the trees.

I‘ ddy was 1rnmed'ately ushered, ‘me the presence of
tlieﬁcoionel, ﬁnding him stret'che'd"out ivpon a couch ‘nurse

and asked suddenly: : . , M '

that it was New-year’s, concluded that he could

had no difficulty in recognizing as a hundred-dollar hm,
