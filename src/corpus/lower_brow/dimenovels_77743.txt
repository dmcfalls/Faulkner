During the drive down-téwn, Nick was strangely

had decidedﬂupon. l - " l ' F’ ,;j

 

With’Sturtevant’s permission, he ha'd taken‘ the seat’, 

under the wheel, and he presentlyguided it into a 

. street, and finally brought it to a stop before a sign  

read, “Thomas Glynn, Contractor,” where he was pres:

ently engaged in an earnest and low-toned conversation,

with Mr.'Glynn; and if youhad been lookingeon at that

» conversation, as Sturtevant did, without being ableit 

overhear a word of it, you would have wondered at thef‘

broadness of the grins which swept over the. faceof  ,
contractor, while the detective talked to him. “ X

rangement of the lamps was thought f.
Bracket lamps and candles with t eir, ﬁxtures, to take
the plface of the electric lights, which the “ghosts” could
ion and off at will; and the woik of adjusting these

 that anattempt wouldbe made to capture them, for
byjﬂoing that, the “ghosts”.would defeat their own ehds,

Out at the stable, Glynn said to the detective:

“Won’t this stuff strangle ouiiown friends, if they are 1 
prisoners, as well 'as the ‘ghosts,’ Mr. Carter ?” V I .

“I suppose it will make them ‘decidedly /uncomfortz-ﬂlble,”
replied the detective. “‘But we can’t avoid that; and there A. .
isn’t any real danger in using it. ’1.‘hereAi's_n’t enough of
it to do any real damage. I merely wish to drive the l

the night, and had decided to leave the remaining two _: '

that. . . ‘ .
He ﬁgured it out that the conspirators were themselves 
arranging for some great coup,which they proposed,» to  .
play upon‘ the .two men who remained’, and were 5 i2‘/‘V’:
awaiting a -good opportunity to spring it; and, in this they '2
was right, as it proved, ‘although the “ghosts” were never

ive and the contractor, ‘side by side——and they inserted" 
the tubes in the holes that ‘had been prepared for thiérnga;
and then led, the ends across the ﬂoor of each room,,an'd'_" 
intothe halls, where they were connected with: a larger’; ,;
tube. ' At the bottom qf,the stairway the two larger tubes"  M
were joined together, and then the still greater one"l‘led‘ -

Thejapanese understand this principle. All their ﬂower-VVV
vases are of the plainest possible construction. _But the
ﬂower-loving Japs go to the opposite extreme in displaying '
their ﬂowers, and try by judicious arrangement to get the‘
’best possible results from ‘very few ﬂowers. They seldom 1
display more than half a dozen ﬂowers in a vase, and try
always to have more foliage than bloom, making green V‘
the predominant color, thus setting,off'to the bestVadvan- ‘
tage the tint of the tlower against‘ a neutral background.
That, however, is a nuftter of taste. A few ﬂowers ,wel‘l~dis—V -

the tame elephants which are a feature of the show. There

Indo—Chinese village. As they were supposed to be the
tamest elephants in captivity, they were not chained or tied
V up in any way. To create the illusion of a herd roaming
the jungle they were turned loose in a copse surrounded
by "an unobtrusive barrier when they were not busy doing
_' ‘ stunts under direction of their keepers. 5 T . is

Nobody knows what prompted the freak, as the elephants
,, haven’t told any one, but one ﬁne day, without warning, the
‘whole herd began trumpeting, and then moved in solid pha-
lanx on the unobtrusive barrier.

gberies and rockeries and butting‘-rd, wn numerous “native
shuts” which were features of the _;‘exhibition, they started
‘across country for the Bois de Virtcennes, one of the tame
forests of Paris, where they proceeded to enjoy themselves

as if they were in their native wilds. V
They pulled branches of big trees and snapped little ones
in twoand devoured all the saplings insight, until their
, keepers, aided by the employees of the show, made a cordon
 " around them and drove them back to their enclosure‘ with
sharp hooks and goads. They‘were hardly back and the
A ‘barrier patched up around them when they began trumpet-

A"';7 ‘ing again. ‘ With a rush they once againmade their way

, toliberty, creating havoc as they passsed. ,
Thistime the whole village of Nogent turnedjlout as
up ; elephant-ihunters. When they were surrounded in some

-SOL SLOCUl\/:I’S TRAi:?;

, ,

BY J. R. HAMMOND.

 

“Sol,” said old Daniel Reyburn to one of his ii
men, or, rather, boys, for he was but a boy ell2he1'*~lﬂ yea
or size, though he carried an olderhead on his shoulde
than a great many grown men, “I want you to catcié
Chadley, and put my saddle on him, and be careful abo
ﬁxing the blanket so it won’t hurt his back, and ti
over to the post-ofﬁce and get the mail, and call at A
blacksmith’s shop and see if them plows are sharpens
and tell theblacksmith to make me aclevis like the .
on that two—horse plow, and two lap rings, and be sit" a
to have them ready when I send after the plows. I do» i
want you to ride Charley hard. You’ve got plenty,
time to get back before nightwithout going out of»
walk, and I’ll expect you back in time to help about mil
ing and feeding.” , ‘ e =_V

Having-‘delivered himself of the above somewhat ela ,
rate instructions, Reyburn walked back into the ho.
and S01 caught Charley, saddled him, and rode OE on:
errand." - g ' " .2  -'

Now, Sol Slocum, though an orphan, and probably
consequence thereof having no one duly autlrlori’zed _tef?
restrain his little impetuousities, was one of the*most7i
repressible little imps that ever lived, and previous to
entering Reyburn’s service had raised the flag of rebellio
and waged open warfare against every family in.whie
hehad been employed, and frequently in less than‘aTWeé

The very moment a disposition,/toward coericion, :
crowding him, as he termed it~—that is, requiring tnoref A
him than he thought just and equitable—'was manifeste
by any member of the family, ta, spirit of ihsulbordinatio .
was aroused_in his breast, and there was no more 
in that family as long as Sol remained a member of-"i ‘
but, as a general thing, his obstreperousness procu‘red5jf

“him the privilege of departing at once, a privilege that‘,
invariably took advantage of. ‘ ' T ,   *

-Reyburn was well aware of his rebellious; dispositi

when he employed him. In fact, one "of! is.,acquain

as made it an easy task for him to crawl-on his hands .‘

.- can’t be found, ‘you mustn’tigo back on me on that ac-
count. I'm not responsible for its removal.” -
Had So1’s hair been of the sort that on terriﬁcally
thrilling-soccasions involuntarily. erects itself like quills
on the “fretful porcupine’s” back, here was a ﬁrst-rate op-
portunity for a display of that kind; but his mind was
so intently occupied xduring this diabolical conversation
' , in devising ways andmeans for thwarting the scheme of
, these ,cold—blooded murderers and robbers that, though
' the. opportunity presented itself, he failed to proﬁt by it.
Slowly, cautiously, noiselessly as ‘any member of the
feline persuasion could have accomplished the,task, he
worked himself back to the other en'd of the beam,
dropped to the floor, crept out of the barn, and then went
in a brisk run up to the house. Gliding into the house as
stealthily as he had crept out of the barn, he made his
way to where Reyburn’s double-barrel shotgun was hang-
ing, took it down, and slipped out agaimwithout disturb-
,;_ing any of the inmates, and then hurried back to the
l fbarﬁ. . l t ‘
‘L j ‘ Now, right underneath the ‘window through which the
l robbers had crawled into the barn, was a large cistern
some "twelve feet deep, and with about ﬁve feet of water
-’ in it. It was covered with a trap-door some ﬁve feet
, , square, made of oak plank.-. Sol raised this trap-door from
 over the mouth of the cistern, and propped it up on the
.  far side from the barn in such a way‘ that when the rob-
.I=H bersiwent to jump from the barn window, should they
chance to overleap the cistern, it would catchtthem
-and causethem to slide back into the cisternxf This he
 ,. did in so noiseless a manner as not to attra the atten-
* tion of the robbers, who were lying within a few feet of
;him and almost directly over his head.
f The next thing was to give them a big scare, so as
" tojcause them both to,jump from the window simulta-
“ , tneously, thereby ‘increasingthe chances of precipitating
‘ themselves into the cistern. To this end ﬁe] worked his

  

     

, the robbers, and commenced talking ‘in a low tone of
 voice, as if engaged in conversation/with some one. Pres-
 ﬁently he heard one of the rnen say: A _
' ' “What’s that? Don’t you hear somebody talking?”

  
  

, I tipn, and was satisﬁed they were listening, Sol said, in a
 [louder tone of voice: p . . .. .

 « ‘-‘I know they’re"‘her.e,.because I heard them laying their
pla 5, which were to murder you, and Mrs. Reyburn,
"311 me, and as many more as they might_ think necessary
“ to accomplish their ‘designs, and then rob the house. You

Uandwhen’ they run out at the door, shoot them‘; I’ll take
