Dear Sir: I"have‘just ﬁnished reading No. 128:. I sus~
_ected;»Cra’obe from the time the light was turned. out.
' y reason for suspecting "him - was this':. Mr." Delmar‘

y”_,said, in his» story, that’ his diamond was colorless, and
I ' when he turnedthe light on Crabbe had his glass tohis
, ',_.,lips'. _Now, I saidto myself that diamond is colorless,
it he ,(Crabbe) could pretend to‘ be drinking andat the

game time drop the storie in the water.
By reading 2 further I. found that, my suspicion “of
Crabbe» was well grounded as it proved” just as .I had

, guessed; I alsoisuspected that Crabbe éoullg jsgeehtbecause

 from suchia man as Crabbe], But no niatter.what’Nick

as he had to striphe could not have the diamond on his f

 Four persons would be beneﬁted by Wﬂdon’s death,
i Dixon, Moloney, Madge Dixon and Cuiiiiiiings. Suspi~

‘r cion is turned away from Dixon by his confducbtoward" "

‘ , Nick, and Madge’s conversation with Ctiinniings ‘showed
{ her innocence. '
' _By a minute examination‘ of the scene of the crime,

N‘iék"‘di"'scovered that the murderer was a‘ man” with

unusually large hands. This was shown by the blood-
, stains on the clothes in the closet. - Footprints showed
it that he limped in his right leg. ‘ ‘ ' '

, M-olo‘ne“y’ dead. This gives his motive for the crime.‘
E VMoloney, of course, had as strong a motive in belong-
V ing to the club.  ' . pi ' I
V Remeinbering‘ these facts, we must ‘conclude that it
‘ was eitheriﬂnnimings who committed the crime‘ or
-Mol/oney'dis'gnised as Cummings. Had MoloneyV been
tkimpersonating Cummings, as the connection with the
other murders of a girl resembling Madge might lead us

to think, he would have done so, only on the possibility ‘

i of his being seen by some chance passerby. But the‘foot-
iprints showed that the ni_urderef- limped; Moloney,

isnpersonaltingi Cuimnings, never’ wouldthave t‘hou—ght'‘”of :
limping when there was no one to see him do it‘. ‘Hence,

Cummings was‘ the "nittrderer. L . . ,
