words, and then the soft tones continued:

“Pass. out of the hotel by the Twenty—fourth Street
exit. Walk slowly toward Sixth Avenue. As you go,

‘after you are outside of the hotel, wrap that money

’- you have in your handkerchief, put your watch and all

I ‘V your jewelry with it, tie the corners together, and

when you meet a man who says, ‘It is well, my friend,’
, give him the handkerchief you have tied together.
Go.” ’

Nick turned about obediently, as he had seen other

victimsdo before that day, and made his way toward

the Twenty—third Street entrance.
I Hehad successfully stood the test to which he had
applied himself, although even so, he could not deny
_ that he had felt strangely inﬂuenced by the words and
V near presence of the man.
He realized that without the warning and the’ di-
re‘ctions he had received from Doctor-Hackenbush, he

 too must havefallen a victim to the hypnotic inﬂuence,

so strange and ‘terrible a power did it exert.
V But the moment he was away from the hypnotist,
the feeling left him, and he was‘-as powerfully in pos-

l 2 session of his senses as he everrhad been.
, t Helrealized that the case was practicallly won now.
v.»hThat it was only aquestion of'a few minutes before

”'  he would seize‘ upon thethief and hold him; and the

 mysterious robberies would all be explained. .
‘  llrrthat. moment he -thought,’ ,with a smile, of Doctor

‘.  farsoiis, to whom there" would now” be proof that he

   
 
 

 

 had been hypnotized; and he thought again" of the two

 7kin'c'ls‘jof cranks that the other doctor-had described,

, :dé‘ciding"tliatlie believed in Hackenbusl1’s'r sort rather

ithan the other, as typified by’ Parsons; '

work arranging his valuables and money’ as the Hindu ‘

had directed him to do, walking onward the while, and

conscious that the man of the crystal could not be far ,;

away. .

Presently, as he approached Sixth Avenue, he saw
the Hindu coming, but he made no sign that he did so,
of‘ course. ' ‘

He realized that now the crucial moment had ar-

rived, and that the dénouement was near. ‘

And so they drew nearer and nearer together, with" S
Chick somewhere about, closely observant of every-~

\

thing.

CHAPTER XII.

“ THE CAPTURAE.

When he came, face to face with the Hindu he
stopped exactly as he had seen the other victims do,

and instantly, when the words were uttered that the _,
C Hindu had told him about, he passed over the hand?-

. kerchief he had prepared. _
It was his duty to turn away at once then, and to

go in the opposite direction, for so the thief toldlhirn, 

to do. _ , _ W
But he did not do any such‘ thing. ’ 

Instead, he stood perfectly still for an instant, and 
‘itlien as the Hindu, seemingly astonished, repeatedithe ';
order, Nick shot his Iﬁst out, caught the man, who 
dodged qu.ickly,i a glancing blow at’ the; sideoft the i

head, and sent him whirling backward.
But the man did not fall.

-He seemed wonderfully agile, and‘ he evidentlyn

realized on the instant that he had played

of stealing once too often.

As he staggeredbackward he turned, and instantly’

his game 

r .’

broke into a run down, the street toward Sixth Avenue.,.; ~
He ran like a deer, too, with Nick and Chick»~in full 

pursuit.

5 ' It is not,‘ however, always the longest legs thiat«yca‘n  _
run’ the fastest; in fact, it is rarely so, and NickjCar.-,i _3
ter was a "sprinter-. of the first order at that time,» as‘

is -now».
