{at Stanton’s house, and lying upon his bed at this

 tortures of the other Rudini, who is not only
,1  iling his features of all resemblance to his former
deli, but is perhaps at the same time creating an artiﬁcial
iot upon the brain, which will steal away the memory,
'»at_leAast,render him incapable of denying the right of
, A ton to pose as Sturteviint.

“And that, doctor, is a correct statement, I think, of

"‘I think so, too,” said the detective.

“We must remember, then, that it was four weeks
ago when this accident was supposed to have happened,
for we must conclude that the accident was a fake.”

“Yes,” said Nick, “there is no doubt about that.”

“The man who was intended to be operated upon-—
that is, Sturtevant——was ﬁrst taken to. some place where
he was imprisoned’by Stanton, and after that the chauf-
feur managed to wreck the machine, and to give out the
report that the two men had been injured.

' “Of course,” pursued the doctor, “the accident was a
fake. The ﬁrst move on the part of the conspirators was
to get Sturtevant entirely in their power, where they
could operate on him at their leisure." .\

"I wish, doctor,” said the detective, "that you would
describe to me, if you can, something about how they
would go to work to obtain the results they seek in this
matter.” e L

“I could only tell you how I would do it myself were
I working under those conditions," re lied the doctor.

“That is exactly what I wish you tovd_o.”

A“We will begin, then,” said the doctor, “with the sup-
position that you are Stanton, and that you have brought

 

     
 

“Yes.”

“Sturtevant, we will say, i§ lying on that couch over
there, stupeﬁed, while you are plotting with me and the’
other physicians to carry out the work we have in hand.” A

“That is the idea,” said!Nick. ‘ A

“My first business, then, would be to get as  -'

ful man, and he has the temper of the devil. He will
ﬁght at the drop of a hat, and he scratches and claws
like a cat.”

“All right. I’ll ﬁx him. Do you want him now?”

“Yes. At once.”

When the detective ascended to his study shortly after-
ward, he .found Chick there, standing in front of Rudini,
who was seated in a Morris chair, to which Chick had
fastened him by" using two pairs of handcuffs; that is, he
had fastened the doctor’s right ankle and h_is left wrist
to the leg and the arm of the chair respectively, so that
his right arm and left leg were free to move about as
p he might choose to use them; but he could not leave

the chair.

Almadder man never sat in a Morris chair.

His eyes blazed like the eyes of a fury,, his brows were
corrugated with scowls, which grew deeper_ and blacker
as Nick entered the room, and his ﬁngers twitched ner-
vously, as if he would cheerfully have given all he pos-
sessed for the privilege of being free for‘ a moment, in
order to attack the men who held him so ignominiously

He was a ﬁne—looking n3an——rather handsome, in fact,

 with classic features, good chin, broad forehead, and with
‘I I eyes that were set rather wideiapart. '

‘tectiye entered the room. _
V “This is an outrage!” he exclaimed. “And you--you
are the man who has committed it.” 1
it He pointed one ﬁnger at the detective, and held it sus-
V’ r, pended, trembling with the nervous rage into which he
was thrown. _ u '
I /“Yes,” irepliedthe detective'quietly.- “I am the man

in numbers. When only two or three are gathered together
they lack the conﬁdence for a charge, but they pursue tac-
tics that are just as exciting to those against whoin'th'eir
ire is kindled. They lift up their heads afar off, and gage
the distance between themselves‘ and your boat. Then’ they
dive, with much ungraceful exhibition of a black back and

I e a ﬂapping of broad hind ﬂippers. The interval during which

they are under water is not pleasant for you. Fortunately,

’ they‘ do not often calculate their distance perfectly. Usually

a great black head appears ten to ﬁfteen feet away from you.

And you must be quite ready to shoot it with great prompt-
ncss, or it will disappear again, andrin a moment you will
feel a scraping upon the bottom of yopr boat, and it will

begin to rise bodily out of the water. '

It is said that in Siam apes are in great request among

the Siamese merchants in their country houses. Vast quan-

tities of base coin has obtained circulation, and the facglty
of discrimination between good money and bad would apliear
to he possessed by these gifted monkeys in such an extraor-
dinary degree of development that no human being, how-

‘ ever parefully trained, can compete with them, The cashier
’ ape meditatively puts into his mouth each coin presented

to him in business payments, and tests it with great delib-
eration. If it be genuine he hands it over to his master;

 if it be counterfeit, he sets it down on the counter before
him with a solemn grimace of dissatisfaction. This method‘

of testing is regarded in commercial/ circles in Siam as
infallible, and, as a matter of fact, t/he decision of the ape
is uniformly accepted as ﬁnal by all parties interested in
the transaction.

 

 

. THE MASTER CRIMINAL.

BY JABEZ BALFOIUR.

VVlien Holt, the reformed English crook, had once
started on the subject of bank burglaries hemade his
-revelations with extraordinary zest. ' V’ ‘

Like all the fraternity, Holt wasvain, andinordinately

I fproud of his exploits. I fancy that at the time this weak-
ness and an absolute indifference to truth led him to ex-

aggerate; I had no means at hand of testing his ac-
curacy, so that I had’ to take his word for everything he

‘conﬁded to me. I had, of course, n opportunity what-

ever of making notes on paper, and-I have to rely entirely
ona fairly retentive memory. /Dvoubtless Holt’s revela-
tions are, in the main, correct, but itis quite possible that
g1i.5gr¢pa;j¢ies may exist. For these discrepancies Lof
cou‘i'se,:aii1 not responsible. I am not relating this re-

‘markable event of my own knowledge. V, I am relating
what I-Iolt_told»me. ‘ ‘

, 'v“For"a long time I" had not seen Shinburn,’7 said Holt.
“Heywas a,’ lover of art, and it occurred to me that as
