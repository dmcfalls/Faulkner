7 ,CHAPTl1‘.R I.——The Lad From 'Frisco Saves’
”  Broke\r Manley.

“Look out below! Jump for your lifel” yelled
a stentorian voice from a window on the third
story of 9. big oﬂice building in Wall Street one
morning when the business of the ﬁnancial dis-
trict was just getting into full swing.

,".‘Manley, ,a well—known broker, and one of ‘Wall
Street's solid men. The cry was taken up by a
score of excitedpeople inthe immediate vicinity,
 Mr. Manley, waking up from a brown study

is he walIked,,along, suddenly became aware that
something‘ unusual was transpirin , and that
somehow or another he was the chic ﬁgure in it.

' Before he realized just what was in the wind,
It briglitélooking boy of eighteen years dashed for-
ward and gave him a tremendous shove that sent
, him staggering and sliding a cou_ le of yards
v ‘from the spot to the door of, a bro erage house
‘where he slipped and landed almost on his back.

»'l‘£lie,-thud of his body, hitting the walk was

ﬂrowned in a tremendous crash that awoke the ‘

echoes of the street, and ﬁlled the air with a
ower of brokenﬂint-like material and a cloud
of dust, a part of which settled over the recum-
bent ﬁgure of the broker, destroying the ,spick-
f —-span appearance of the gentleman’s clothes
"m"1'd’s1lk hat. . -
..’_._l‘he crash was caused by the fall of a new safe
tit was being lifted into the window whence
the ﬁrst warning cryihad come. The boy whose

ygresence of mind had saved the broker's ‘life’ es-- ,
gggid himself by a very narrow margin. Covered 3

 ~ " dust, and with one of his ears bleeding
 a jagged, missile, ,.he ran to Mr. Manley
, seizing him by one of his arms, assisted him

' k 's '£eet., .

““I beg your pardon for treating you.so roughly,
j§§1“°.';‘bu.t under the circumstances I couldn’t stand

as he "took out his handkerchief. and pro-

into the sub-cellar.

Mr. Manley looked and gasped. —
“Was I under it?” ''

“Yes, sir. You paid no attention to those daxige ’ H Y I’

signs warning passers—by to avoid that art of
the sidewalk, andwhen the man above yeﬁed out;

you kept right on, so -I adopted the only means , W _
could think of on the spur of the moment to - ‘ ’

save“ you. Itwas touch and go for both of us,‘
but we won out."

“My dear boy, you have saved my life," cried‘
the broker, understanding at last theperil he had
escaped through the lad’s prompt action, grabing

his hand and shaking it. “You have placed me ‘

under an obligation I never can repay.”

i“'ljhat”s all right, sir. You are welcome to the
service. ’ b
“You might have been killed yourself."

“I admit I took some chances, but it was a
good cause.” i

Quite a crowd had gathered around the broker
and the boy who had saved his life, and many-
ﬂattering remarks were passed on the young fel<
low’s courage. ,

,“W11_'<1t is Your name, my boy?” asked Mr.VMan- 
lley, still holding his rescuer by the hand.

“Fred Munson.” . p r ,
“My name is Manley. ' Come'Wit_h me to my
oﬂice. It is close by." .

Taking the boy by the arm the broker led him 7

out of‘ the crowd just as a police officer came up.

.He readily understood from the sight of ,the 

safe—mover’s truck, the swinging tackle in ‘the

air, and the gaping hole in the sidewalk around» i 

which a mob had gathered, what had happened,

. for he had heard.,the crash half. a block away.

He stopped the broker and the lad, whofrong’ ,
appearance seemed to have been” within the

danger zone, and asked them some questions. - ,3
He took, their answers down in his note-.bo_ol¢‘.
andthen allowed them to proceed. -' Five minutes
later the, broker was ascending the elevator‘ to

‘ ' rang for his oﬂice-boy and told him. to get’ a

 “You seem conﬁdent of your ability to make

himself at a desk by a window openin ‘

;'W_i1l be sorry that he sold me the control of the
gminefor a bagatelle. He thought he was un-
loading a white elephant on me,” chuckled the boy.
:,.."These wild and woolly Westerners sometimes
ovei-reach themselves, and Brannan certainly made
5:the ‘mistake of his life when he sold me his
~ 50,100 shares for 25 cents a share. It took nearly
all the money my father left me to pay forthe
-“stock, but I had inside" information about the
property» and I knew I was making a good in-
-Jfesstment. One of these days I expect to make
any fortuine, out of it. At the last meeting of the
seompany in ’Frisco, ‘just before I left, I had my-
self elected president in place of Brennan, so there
 isn’t"any danger that anybody can _do me_out of
" " the mine,‘ should anything transpire while I'm
 East.” _
., ,Fred"‘tnmed to the ticker and looked for a quo-
°?ta;tio'nv about Erie and Illinois‘ Central, for the
change had been open for about an hour. .
e, found that Erie had .- gone_ up anoher half
 t',1a'nd I. C. a quarter of a point. ‘

‘ “That makes me about $60 better oif than I
“(ﬁgured on"," said Fred. “I’ll go over ‘to my broker
d"tell him to sell both stocks.” , '

-, He put on his hat, locked up his office and
Vaétarted for the office of Broker Valentine, ~,on

Broad Street. ,
’ Fred ‘had started in business with a capital of
‘ly $3,000, and it cost him about $300 to ﬁt up
'oﬂ‘ice and pay. a month’s rent in advance.
1%’ put $1,000 margin up on his “Erie shares,
‘rid $500 on his Illinois Central, so he had about
1,000 to fall back on in his oﬂice safe.
i"s“‘l§ig Bonanza” shares had cost him $12,525,
ee, months previous, but as the mine was not
ggnsidered, a. paying roposition, the money was
practically sunk,for t present, and Fred did not
“unt"it as available capital‘. _ ' ~ .
‘13h'e'boy‘knew that several of the other stock-

ject,Abu't that’s the way I'm built, so what's the - . :5
use ‘of talking ? I wantto feel in the days to come \
that my success in life is due wholly to my own‘,
efforts. I know Iishall take a lot of pride in that
fact if I ultimately reach the top of the ﬁnancial
ladder.” - d
When he‘ reached Valentineis oﬁlce he gave '
in his selli g order. - - V
The ticker showed a further advance of half a . 
point in Erie, which gave him a proﬁt of $300 in I
sight on that stock. . -.
I. C. had also gone up 3-8 more. and so he
would make an even $100 on that above all ex- a
penses. ‘ . i »
Altogether the advance in the 'rket that ?"
morning had made him $125 better off. than he‘ ’ i
had calculated on when he came downtown; ~ 
After leaving his broker’s he went down to the  ‘ i
Curb to see how the mining and other stocks dealt
in by the traders there were doing. . , 
There was nothing startling going on. but he ‘
overheard a bunch of traders talking about,his_
rescue of Mr. Manley. , ‘
They. say that listeners never hear any good of
themselves, but this instance was an exception,
for the brokers spoke in very complimentary
terms about his nervy act, quite unconscious that
thecboy they were talking about was within ear-
shot of their conversation. g 
That afternoon the newspapers had the story in, g  ’
their columns, and Fred on his ,way uptown to his  r
boa_rding~house saw his name and deed in print, ‘ L 1
Several of the boarders read foe story, too, I,’ ’
before they came in to supper, so when Fred ap-1' '
peared he found himself an object of particullr “
interest. ’ _ . .
“Was that really you, Mr. Munson, who saved‘ 
the broker this morning from being crushed by . ‘
a falling safe?" asked one of the ladies, looking’,
at him sweetly. _ ~
Fred modestly admitted that it was really he. ,
“Why, you’re a real hero, aren’t you ?” she said, ‘ : ..‘
and the others expressed the same opinion. ’
Fred felt somewhat embarrassed at .the
that was showered upon him. _ p
“I don't see howayou had the nerve to do it, my
dear fellow,” said a young Englishman, who was _
a clerk in a British insurance company downtown. V .,
‘Fred smiled and went on eating. "
“The paper said the safe weighed several tens,” 
said the lady. “Just think of the risk youran. K
The gentleman miist be very grateful to you.in- ~
deed for saving his life.” ‘ . 
Fred had as little to say on the subject as pos-‘ I L
sible, and was much relieved when’ one of the,  ,
boarders started a discussion about the new ”
spring style in ladies’ hats, which he declared to
be ridiculous. _, » 
_The ladies present took.issue with him, and‘ 
nothing more was said about the Wall Sheet sen- 
sation while Fred remained at the table. ’ K . 
' The boarders knew‘ that Fred was connected in
some way with Wall Street. but as he volunteered
no information about his business, tﬁy did not 

, .

  

     
  

  

The general opinion was that he’ was a clerk in

‘ ‘ She decided to invest it in something that would

about, the lad from ’Frisco came downstairs and

.  “Indeed!” she exclaimed in a tone of surprise,
. for she thought Fred looked very young to be in
business for himself. “You are not a broker?”
"-‘No, majam; but I do business with brokers.”
“You must be a very smart boy to have an office

~‘§Jr3oyyou take me for a fool?" replied Fred,

_"..The rascal '_made another effort, with no better
result than before. Finding that the boy was
 him at arm’s reach, he adopted different
tactics. Pushing the foot of the stool aside he
‘(lied to close with the ’Fris-co’ lad. Fred ..met him
 showing the side of the stool in his chest with
force enough to ‘make him grunt. The rascal,
however, was worked up into a desperate_state
vof mind, for he heard that the janitor’s assistant
'uiig1it_ come to the door at any moment, and in
that ‘case he expectid that the boy would shout
_for‘- help, and the janitor, ﬁnding the door locked

was something wrong inside. _It was necessary,

. He rolled the fellow over on his face and fel

in his hip pocket for his -handkerchief. Instea

of a handkerchief the crook had a bulldog re-
volver in it. Fred pulled it out and laid it on the‘
carpet. He knew that he had the rascal dead
to rights now. Taking out hisown handkerchief
he bound the man’s wrists together behind his
back. Picking up the revolver, he ran to the door,’

‘unlocked and opened it, and hastened to the ele-

vator. By this time the elevator man had ﬁnished ,.’ '
his work and gone home, but Fred thought he
might ﬁnd one of the janitors somewhere around.
Not seeing any signs of anybody about, he shout- _
ed down the elevator. In a few minutes one of
the ‘ janitors ‘started up in a rage, supposing .
that a belated tenant wanted to get down. I - I

"Come with me," said Fred, excitedly. “Mr. 
Mooney, the money—lender, has been knocked out - i"
and robbed by «a.,crook, and I have, caught the ~
rascal.” » ’ ’ '

“The dickens!" exclaimed the astonished’ assist- ‘
ant, hardly believing his ears.

§»* Fred pulled him along by the .arm till they 

reached Mooney’s oﬂice. The first thing the jani-_

‘tor saw was the crook stretched out on the ﬂoor; 5

‘‘That’s the scoundrei,” said the young» specu-
lator,' “I had quite a tussle with him before I .
got the best of him. Now, look into the private  .
room.” ,

« The janitor did, and beheld the unconscious
money-lender lying white and.,motion1ess on the
rug in front of his safe. " ' ’

“How in thunder did this thing happen?” he
asked. .

“Don’t ask me. He was done up before I got ’
here. I heard a crash of glass. You see the 3
upper part of the door here is broken. That
first attracted my attention‘as I was leaving my
office. Then ﬁnding the outer door of this office
unlocked I walked in to see if anything was
wrong here. I -saw that rascal stooping over Mr.
Mooney and taking a package ‘of money from his
inside pocket. ‘That was enough to show that .
there was crooked work going on. Before I could
draw back the fellow caught sight of -me, and
following me to-the door, nabbed me before I ‘
could get out. We had it hot"for a while_ until
I managed to «trip him up. He hit his head on
the stool and that put him in my power.”

“I’ll run down and,notify the head janitor.”

“Wait a while. I'm goingto. telephone for an,
ambulance and the police,” replied ~Fred. “Keep’
your eye on that. crook while I’m engaged.” ~

There was a telephone on the money—lender's ';
desk, and Fred went to it. He first called up the
nearest hospital-and asked that an ambulance be
sent right ‘away to the Blizzard Building; then
he communicated with the. First Precinct polices ,
station, and hurriedly explained what had hap-» 
pened. He was told that a patrol-wagon and a ’
couple of officers would be sent right away to take
charge of the prisoner. That was all Fred could‘
do, so he let the janitor go to notify his superior
and bring him on the scene. _ f

  CHAPTER» X.——“Big Bonanza” comes
9 I ' "r to the Front. *" w,

‘A ‘few days after Prescott’s'departure Fred
made another deal inpthe market. This time it
was S. & T., which looked buoyant to him. He
hadnoticéd that it had gone up from 85 to 87
and he concluded to get in on it right away and
see how he’d come out.’ 4

He went to Broker Manley and gave ‘him an
_o'i:derafor 600 shares. They were duly bought

A and the trader notiﬁed him to that effect; It
I was about this time that Fred and Mr. Mooney
‘were ‘summoned before the June Grand Jury to
y ‘testify against Jud Parker, the crook, who had
not got out of bail, but had been in the Tombs
,‘ since his arrest. ‘The Jury, being satisﬁed that
, the People got the case against the rascal, handed
‘ in an indictment charging him with felonious
assault and attempted burglary’ to the District
— Attorney’s oﬂice. When he would be tried rested
‘ , altogether with that official. V Fred had his at-
‘. ‘_ 'tenti'on centered on S. & T. and was not greatly
, pleased to ﬁnd that instead of continuing to go

 

 
  
  

‘ V up it began to go the other way. Threedays

after he bought it, it was roosting at 85%; Which
represented a loss to him of $900~’without consid-

. , ' ering interest a.nd commission. During the fol-
 lowing week it continued to see-saw between 85

 

 reached, which was three—eights lower than Fred
" hadrpaid for it. ' "

‘ Finally after another week of ﬂuctuation it
«went to 877/s. Fred promptly sold out, as he

 

 of t(l)ie deal were deducted he found he ha made
$30 . ‘ I . ’ ».

" . “That’s. betterlthan a loss at any rate,” he
thjought. “It's the first money I’ve made» this

    
  

jrnake any more. Well, after deducting my ex-
penses I ‘ am about $100 ahead. Things are
working rather slow with me of late. However,
I ‘shall begin to .push ‘Big Bonanza’ after‘the
flirst, and then my aifairs ought to grow more
, ﬂourishing.” ,  ,., -

Tired promised to call and then took his leave.
After lunch he dropped in to see Mr. Mooney,

oﬂ"1cej when he got through business for the day.

V Fred’s telegram he lost no time in sending word
" about’ the rich lode to the officials of the Goldﬁeld

«the stock, but those who had it were in no
hhrry to sell, and the price went to 50/ cents a

covery became generally known. Of course the
news was telegraphed to New York and to all

he other mining exchanges. In San ,Francisco,
. where the stock had been in the dumps for sev-

eral,months, much speculation about the unex-

cted ﬁnding of a rich lode of silver are in the.

%ig Bonanza” ensued, and the /people who had

originally been identiﬁed as stockholders but had .

old. out their holdings, began to feel exceedingly
sore. The man who was hit the hardest was

Sain~B1-annan, the bigwesterner. He was sim-»
’ His ,

lyg. paralyzed when he heard the report.
Ernst impression was that. it was a» fake. » He
rigvshed around to the real estate office of J arboe

the secretary. Pres--‘

The stock jumped on the San v

rman H'_'7lv5~

to make money out of it. All he regretted was
that he had not been ‘able to secure more. For ‘  '
his inability to do this he blamed Superintendent , .
Fish, who had feathered his own nest on the Z .
uiet before announcing the discovery. ‘On 0 ‘
ay following the announcement of the discovery
of ore in the mine, Sam Brannan left San Fran-.v ,
cisco for Nevada. As ‘there was blood in --his H 4
eye, it looked. as if there would be something‘ W
doing when he reached the mine. Three days‘ .
later, while Fred was sitting in his office talking" H
with a couple of Curb bro ers about “Big Bo-  
nan.za,” a Western Union messenger came ht 
and handed him a despatch. He -signed for it. .. =
tore the envelope open and read the following; i . A
“Fred Munson, Room 650, Bliuard Building‘, .

“Lookout for Sam Brannan. He has _ ,

Swears he was swindled. Says he will get stock I.
back or there will be something doing. Handle -
him gently pr there will be trouble. r “F! ’.
' 31:.’

Fred never turned a hair at this startling in-
telligence. He cooly returned the despatchto its
envelope, put it in his pocket and went on talkﬁ ~ g
with his visitors. ‘ When they went away F~ ‘ »
took out the despatch and read it again. .

“I_;may expect to see him within three days,?’- "; i
he muttered. “Well, let him come. If he thinks
he can intimidate me into * —'ving up the stock I
bought of him, he is greaty mistaken. He.’s'fa.. ,

trouble. They carried the young speculator back
along the wide landing, through a doorway and
upanother ﬂight of stairs. He was taken into a ,
roonxthat was lighted by the moonbeams and de-
posited on the bare ﬂoor. Then the men left him’ /
alone. Fred heard them go downstairs, and pres-.
ently their footsteps died away.

“I’d give something”to know what is at the
bottom of this affair," thought the boy. "It looks
mighty mysterious to me. They certainly have
some object in view which concerns Mr. Mooney
and me. What in thunder it is, puzzles me,”

The sound of footsteps sounded again, coming
up,_a-nd the boy had little doubt but that they
were carrying the senseless money-lender.

This was true, and ‘they soon came into the
room with Mooney. The leader walked over to
Fred, raised him ‘against the wall and took the
gag from his mouth. '

“Perhaps you'll explain the meanin “of ‘this’
singular outrage?” was the ﬁrst thing red said,
looking at the leader.

"You and Mooney have been brought here be-
cause Jud Parker is to be tried on Tuesday, and ,5
we intend that you shan’t, or either of you, appear
as witnesses against him,” was the re ly.

_t His words made the matter quite c ear to the
boy. He saw the point, but thought it a foolish v
one on the part of the men, who evidently were‘ i
Jud Parkér’s friends.  ‘

“Well, I don't know where you've brought us _.
to, but it isn’t a great way from P7—— and Mr. , ‘
Mooney’s home. I think a detective’ will have no; ,' ‘
great trouble in locating us, and then your little ‘
game will be up.” , ‘ , p _ :

,“We’ll take care of any detective who comes’ ‘
prowling around here. We’ve laid out plans -so"
that we won’t fail. In good time an application
will be made for a reduction of Parker’s.bail.

If the judge sees it in the right light, Jud will 3
get out, and.you and Mooney will be allowed to
go. A new date will be set for Jud’s trial, but
when he’s called to the bar he won’t be’ on hand. M
His" bail will be forfeited and that will end the‘
matter, for Jud will be outside the State- and’
safe.” - _ _ _ _

“Then you intend to hold on to us until this
matter has been ﬁxed to suit you?” said Fred. .

»“»We do.”' ‘ v —j ’

“You’:re not [going to keep us strapped up like‘
this?” said Fred. ‘ ‘

‘ “No; in the morning you’re free to move around 
but foiwthe rest of the night you’l1 ‘remain as ;’
you are.” _ . —

‘ Fred said nothing, for he Judged it would do, "
him no good. u , ,

“Put them both on the bed so they’ll rest easy,” a‘
said the leader to his two companions.’ j ’ _ ‘ —

Mooney was raised up ﬁrstand bundled against ' v
the wall,~while Fred was placed on the outside;  '~'

“Now we’ll leave you for the present,” saidthe
leader, motioning to the others to withdraw. "In
the morning I’ll see you “again.” . i ‘_ I

outside, and Fred heard the key turn in the lock.‘

CHAPTER XI‘V.—-Capture of the Kidnapers.

Fred knew that the gardener slept in a room
‘ , above the garage where Mr. Mooney kept his au-
- l txbmobile. The man was a capable chauffeur as

[L except at such times as the money—lender took it
out himself. Takingthe girl with him he went

haw the -window of the room he had occupied
wide open, and the ladder standing under it, Just
as the rascals had'left “it after bringing Mr.
'-Mooney. out of the house that way. Going to
 the door communicating with the second story of
" the garage he pulled the bell to arouse the gar-
dener. in a few moments the man «pushed up one
of the windows, stuck his head out and asked
"who was there.
 b “I’m here, Fred Munson, William,” replied the
l p T oy. V
' “Why, how is it that you are up at this hour?
It's just twenty minutes after three,” replied the
su rised man. 2 .
“ ut on your clothes and come- down. There’s
been a whole lot doing since you went to bed.”
' Those words were sufficient to start the man

“ at the .door. _
words as possible what had happened to him and
Mr. Mooney, and how the money-lender wasstill
’a prisoner in the haunted house. ~
' “Fortunately I met, the constable of this vil-
lage, and he will be"here shortly with a couple
of assistants to go out to the house, rescue Mr.
» “ Mooney and capture the rascals if possible. You
will have ,to go with us, for there are at least
four men in the scheme, and we shall ﬁnd them

“I’ve got a key to the ‘back door,” said, the .
gardener. “I'll let you in and thenyou can take,
the‘ young lady up  your room.” -  
All right. ‘While I am inside, William, you i .;
had‘ better remove the ladder that those rascals 
usedto enter the house through my room.” ~ 
Fred escorted'Miss Carter to the room assigned
{>0 him, lighted a lamp for her accommodation,
pulled the window down most of the "way, ‘aiiii 
then bade her good-night, assuring her thatfher  13‘
future would be decided on next morning‘ at a, 
consultation between Mr. Mooney and himself, to‘ — ’
which she would be invited as the «most interested ‘7
person. " -v
When Fred reached the yard again tlle" con’-'

uties. The boy and the‘ gardener got in” and the

 
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
 

distance from the house with the unsavory repu-"
tation. Mr. Brown tied the horse to the fence
and the party ofﬁve advanced by a,short-cut;
laying through the adjacent ﬁeld. The supposi-
tion was that the rascals were sleeping in’ o"ne~«‘0£

   
  
 
 
  
 
 

their‘ shoes at the front door and started on .a“
tour of investigation. The four men were f0u}_’l.d'~_
in what had once been the dining-room of the ’
house, asleep on a couple of mattresses and‘ 3.1- ,
most fully dressed. A lamp stood on the table ;
near by and this Fred lighted. The ﬂashﬁof" the '
match aroused the leader of the bunchand‘.
started u to find. a revolver shoved under his _
nose by onstable Brown, who ordered him 
throw up his hands. He did so after someihesitaq
tion and one of the deputies handcuﬁiedrhim.‘ , The ,.
others were handcuffed as they lay asleep, and .
this aroused them to the realization that they —
were prisoners. The leatler of the ‘kidnapers was
much astonished to see Fred at liberty, and he
swore roundly at the luck which had overtaken?
him and his companion so unexpectedly."  ‘ _

“I told you that you did a foolish thing _to‘earry
Mr. Mooney and me off in order to prevent'_.u_s
from appearing in court against your friend 
Parker, though I’ll admit that I didn't -expect, to
get free so soon,” said Fred to him.  ,.

had gone through during the night, though un-

prised to learn that she had a young lady guest“ ’ 5,}

 

in the house who was occupying the chamber

allotted to Fred. After breakfast Mr. Mooney,’
Fred and Edith Carter came’ together in the,
library, and then the girl told_;her story with
more detail. These details showed her uncle and ,
aunt up in a worse light than ever; It wasT~de& " .
cided that Mr. Mooney should take charge of her 
for the present, and that, till further arrange-C. 3'
ments .were.made, she would live at the Mooney '
home. The-money-lender said he would put he‘)? ' 
case in the hands of the ‘head lawyer of the vil- 7’ V

The more he saw of her the better.he liked her, ’
and the samemay also be said on her ~si'd,e. In 
fact, by the time they separated ‘that night they?’
had come to think a whole lot of one another:
On Monday morning Fred, Miss Carter, and
Mr. Mooney attended the examination of. the four
kidnapers in the jl1stice’s office, the large outer’
room of which was utilized as a court-room.
When Fred, as the chief witness, had told his
story, Miss Carter took the stand to'corroborate'
that part of itvconnected with the haunted house:.
The constables then stated what they knew about
the case. Wlienthe kidnapers were asked what 
they had to say there were silent. The evidence *
against. them was too strong for them to deny iii,
The justice committed them to the county j.aij;
for trial, and that ended the matter for the presvi
sent. Fred and Mr. Mooney concluded not to go;
to the city that day, since they.could not get  V
there much before two o’clock, and they devote-d~_.>..
the time to‘ consulting with a lawyer on Miss —.
Carter’s behalf. Several callers tried in vainto_~.~
see the young president of the “Big Bonanza’-’. _.
Mining Company that day, but his office remained
closed. Among the visitors was Sam Bi-anna_n,,~..
the big Westerner, who had reached New York "=
on Sunday morning. He called around three—_
times,: but each time found the door of Fred’s of- K
ﬁce locked. Nextmorning‘ Fred and thé’money- ,
