The reverse side had been rubbed down smooth,
andupon this surface certain ﬁgures and letters
had beenvimprinted by a. sharp, tool. With some

' effort Andrew Marven ‘removed the cord from

his neck and held the coin out to the boy. ,
“There is your legacy, my lad. The ﬁgures and
letters on the back. are the clue to the treasure.
I _have tried for years to unravel the mystery of
..their meaning, but my most persistent efforts
roved an utter failure. Perhaps you may have
getter luck. I only know one man who could read
the secret if the coin fell into his hands. He is
a Mexican named Sanchez Guerrero, and if he is
still alive a greater scoundrel does not walk the

‘ earth unhung. Beware of him, for it is too much .

to expect that such a villain as he is gone to meet

— his ‘master, the arch-ﬁend. For ﬁfteen years, ever '

since the day this coin came into my possession,’

Jack Gardiner mechanically obeyed thedying

that anything would ever come out of his mysteri-

his breath came» easier, and it seemed
to Jack t at he had yielded to a ﬁtful sleep. Dur-
ing an this time’the—. storm had ‘been raging furi-

l V ously about the neighborhood, but neither Jack

nor the dying man -seemed to "pay any‘ attention?

A to its presence. N w as the boy sat looking down '

was a,lonesome vigil Jack Gardiner was keeping,

it need not be wondered at if his thoughts were
‘of the gloomiest character. There was little ‘in
his young life so far to give him any satisfac-

 tion. « His father’ was serviiiga life sentence in’, v

and. they fell from a position -of comparative .pros- "
perity to one of absolute indigence.

Of the many friends they once had not one"
came forward to offer sympathy or give them ag‘
helping hand. In a word,_they were ostracised
from, society and the double blow was inorethan _
Jacks mother could bear up under. She grad,-‘
ually faded away until one day. a wreck’ other

his own way against an unfavorable fate.’ He, "

‘became a tramp, working here and there when-1
ever he could ﬁndanything to do, anda preca’ris’__.
ous living he made at the best. ~‘Tw’o years since
. on a _Christmas morning, when the church bells 0
Walhpgford were ringing out good willtoall,
mankind, Jack‘ reached the outskirts of the town‘;
wearyand discouraged after an all-nightfwalk‘: .~ .-
.A few inches of snow .lay on the ‘ground and -
the air was keenly cold. Hehad not eaten any-.

He seemed to have reached’ the end of‘ hiS‘eXlClI3lf‘.- I '
ance, and with a hopeless moan he sank down
on" the"doo‘rstep of the ramshackle dwelling
which we now find him. There Andrew Marven,
returning from a neighboringstore with packages
of food for his Christmas dinner, found him‘. ‘The
man took him in,‘ revived and fed him, and made.
him welcome, and from that day to this.Ja'ck

Perhaps Jack was thinking of all this as he ,
-by the bedside of his dying companion, _thg,?._,o'ne'
man who seemed to understand him and ‘had
treated him like a human being, and was‘. ﬁgmjingl
what his future wouldvbe, when Andrew. Maryen

out into the corridor, when to his further surprise
he found -the door locked. He strucka match and

lookedfat the keyhole, expecting to ﬁnd the key on
the outside, but it wasn’t. There was no key in

- , the keyhole, J aqk scratched his head in some bee ‘

wilderment;

“Why did Swivel. ‘lock me in the room in the
first place, and why carry oil’ the key in the sec-
ond?’T the boy asked himself. . ‘

Of’ course these were questions he couldn't an-
swer. He went to the window and looked out, but
couldn’t see any signs in the air -of a—conﬂagra-
tion. The bell continued tovsend forth its sonor—
ous alarm for some minutes, and then it ceased,
and its vibrations died away into almost profound

/ silence.

“I’d like to know what’s up,” thought Jack, who ‘
was as curious as the majority of boys. “There

‘is certainly something wrong in town or ‘that bell

the door is locked I w nder if I‘can't -get out by

low, and from there I could easily reach the

I’ll do it. ‘I

ment.” ’ ’
So Jack put on his jacket, let himsef dow-n on
to the roof of the ell, and jumped to the ground.
He was ‘soon hurrying along, Main Street in the
direction whence the sound of the bell had come.
He saw a crowd in front of a building, which he

around for his new acquaintance, but saw no signs

,. of him. After hanging around the bank until the

crowd began to break up Jack returned to the
hotel, climbed up on the ell roof with the help of.
the ladder, and pulled himself into his room

himself conspicuous by descending to the ground -
by way of. the roof of _the' ell. As ‘his eye took’ "
in the roof below he saw a brass key lying there,’ ,
glistening’ in the sunlight. It didn't seem" likely
that that could‘ be the missing key, but with the T
idea «that it might ﬁt his door he got out of the

behind the counter reading a paper. '— _ _-  '
“Have you_ seen the young mars who came. with *5
me last even1ng?"_Jack asked him. '  V
“Not this nio_rning," was the answer. “Maybe '
he's in the dining-room‘ getting his breakfast. ' ﬁt“
Jack ‘had his doubts about ﬁnding his compan-
io_n.there, but as he_ was hungry he went.» the '
dining-room, took his seat at a table and waited ‘ '
for oneyof the waitresses to come“ov.er. When she 
did Jack propounded the same question to'he.r."
She answere that the young man in question had .-

still there was no sign of Dick Swivel. ‘Jack then ,1

that the young chap with the bag was

bag and his own as well it would be better for
him to transfer the money to his carpet-bag, as
one bag would be easier for him to carry than
two. With -that idea in his headhe opened the

‘black bag and‘ began transferring the packages

of money to his own bag. ,

.. When the last bundle had bee shoved into his
own bag it suddenly occurred to
be a good joke to ﬁll the vacant space in the black
bagwith a bundle of refuse, that,lay close by in
the loft. The idea appealed to the humorous‘ ‘side

‘ of J_ack’s nature, and he no sooner thought ofait

thanlie carried it out. uWith great caution Jack
moved inch by inch over toward the rear opening

_in the {loft,. carrying his bag with him. ‘The’ _
rattle made by the rain on the roof greatly aided I “

hiin,~and he reached the hole atrlast ‘without any

misadventure.‘ T ‘ _ M , - »,
Jack looked out on the teeming landscape, and

it was with no great feeling of pleasure that he

contemplated the drenching that was before him. ’ '

Pushing his legs and body out‘ backward,vand
dragging his carpet-bag after him, Jack’ dropped
to the ground as lightly as a monkey might.

Supper was nearly ready before Jack's clothes
were ﬁt for him to put on again. By the time the
‘meal was over it was growing dark and Jack
. asked the farmer if he might sleep in the' barn
u I that night, as he didn’t like to tramp at ni ht.

He received permission to do so, and he turne in,

early, being careful to keep the carpet-bag with
him. It was broad daylight when he awoke, and
he heard the farmer moving about the lower ﬂoor
of the barn. Immediately after breakfast he
thanked the farmer and’ his wife for their kind
hospitality, and started back for Blackton to. re-
store the stolen money to the bank. He ‘had gone
but half a‘ mile when a wagon bound for that town
overtook him, -and he was thus enabled to get a
ride over the rest of the road.
. i Owing _to the robbery of all itsiavailable cash
the Blackton Bank had been compelled to.-tem-
orarily close’ its doors, so when J ack reached the
I uilding he found the entrance shut. A number
of townspeople were standingsthere ‘reading the
typewritten notice posted up, which stated that

the institution was in the hands of the State b3J'lk,'

 examiners.‘ .As nobody was ‘admitted into the
building Jack found himself barred out with the
rest; Finally an autoi_nobile’c9,me upto the curb
and the boy heard somebody say that the gentle-
man in the vehicle was the president of the bank.

r“If ydu’ bfoifght it back,” replied the gentleman
incredulously, “where is it?" ,
“In this carpet-bag.”

The president seized the bag, lifted it into the

auto and opened it. It seemed almost tooabsurd .

for him to expect that the boy’s story was true.
Yet the moment he exposed the interior of the bag
he saw that it was jammed full of packages‘ of
bills, done up in regulation bank style. Snapping
the catch to again, he took the b ‘in one hand

T‘Come inside and tell me how you managed to

How they had walked as far as the Blacktoriiﬁ ;

and _was surprised _to ﬁnd thathis companion was
not in bed or evenin thelroom. He had’ evidently

so that it would be perfectlysafe? He decided to
consult with the president of the bank. By the
time he had reduced his satisfaction and enthusi-
asm within reasonable bounds the bell rang for
supper, and stowing his money away in his pocket
he went downstairs to the dining—room.

That night Jack hid the money under the mat-
tress of his bed, but his anxiety about it. caused
his sleé to be disturbed by bad dreams, in all of
uerrero, the English crook,‘ and Dick
Swivel ﬁgured with unpleasant rominence. He_
woke u several times in a frig t, and was not

were safe where ,he had put them. He was up=
and'd’ownstairs next morning nearly an hour be-
fore breakfast was ready, and after the meal he
walked about towncuntil he thought it was ‘time
for the president to be at the ban . ‘

When Jack arrived at the bank, which was not
open, he found a crowd around. the ‘door reading
a notice by theabank examiner which stated that

owing to the recovery of the stolen funds the,bank

would doubtless be able to resume business in a
few days. There was also a notice signed by
the president which stated that the institution
was perfectly solvent, but owing to official red
tape a few days must elapse before business could
be resumed. Jack pushed the button, and when

“He ha3n’t arrived yet,” replied the factotum.

“However, you may come in and wait for _him. 3 0

I expect he will be here any time.”

So.Jack entered the bank, and half an hour'=

later the president arrived; -

“I called to ask you what I had better do with
that $1,000’ the bank presented to me,” said Jack.
"I don’t want to carry it around with-' me, for I

\

might lose it, or; it might be stolen from me.’ . '

What would you advise me to do?”

“It you wish. to leave it with the bank as a
special or time deposit, you will receive interest
on it at therate of 3 per cent. per annum. Or you
can take itover to the Blackton Savings Bank and
deposit it on ‘interest. In either case the money

time you call for it, and it will beearning from

.“It*would4»be a. pity to break the amount for
a small sum, therefore 1- will make you‘ a

 the next room,‘ was not a little excited to learn
‘ * . the character of the job therascals had on hand
‘for that night. ‘After more jingling of I glasses
‘ ‘the crooks began to discuss the nature of the swag
' ‘they expected to lift, and how they should get rid
«, of it to the best advantage. Thus Jack learned
* the name of the man they were going to rob, and
his hobby as a collector of rare and valuable
curios. _

project, and save the"o1d collector from being
’ robbed. He ‘realized that he had very little time in
’ which to act, and that he was under the great
' disadvantage of being a stranger in the town.
_ “I must get into my clothes at once and try

i - ~ ‘Jack’ hastily dressed himself, and havin satis-

i sli ped downstairs to ‘the street, which was al-
‘ ‘t deserted at that hour. The shops in that

-_ vicinity were shut up, and no lights were to be
 seen/but those that shone from the cheap grog-
" ~}geries, andfromxan occasional tenement window.
 Jack had not the slightest idea wherethe police

‘came upon a corner drug-store which was being

‘f ell, what do you want, young man?” he in-
quired. -
j‘I’ve come with information about a burglary
this is to be committed tonight?” Jack answered.
“What’s that?” asked the manhdropping the
paper and looking at his young visitor sharply.
Jack repeated his remark and added:

“The house that is to be robbed is about a mile I

outside the town on the shore of the lake. A col-
‘lector of rare antiques and coins, named Matthew
Warden, lives there.”

The oﬂicer knew the place and the man. In
fact, there was scarcely anybody in Willowdale
who didn’t know'the_estate called Red Gables and
its owner by reputation. ‘

“How did you learn that Mr. Warden’s place
was to be robbed tonight?” askedthe oﬂicer, al-
most incredulously. . V ~

‘Jack told him how, he ‘was a stranger in Wil-
lowd_ale, having only arrived at the town that
evening by rail from Blackton.

“A man I met on the train ‘referred me to the
Lake House as a cheap place for me to put up,”
went on the boy. “It's cheap enough; but I can't
say that/I like the place. I went to bed about
nine o’clock, and a while ago I was woke up in [a
racket in’ the adjoining room. The partition -

The oﬂicer summoned three policemen, who were
sleeping in an adjoining room, and gave them
explicit directions as to what the were to do.
Then he despatched the_m,~.with J ac , to.the scene‘
of the proposed robbery.

Jack walked along with the policeman who was

told him a great deal about the croo s that he.
had had no opportunityto divulge to the oﬁicer in

. .‘31;ou seem to be a smartyoung fellow," said
_the policeman. “You are bound to geta great

water. Perched on the top of the bluff was an old,
weather‘-beaten two-story building.

. “Who lives there?” asked Jack.

“Nobody,” answered ’ Dora.

“The bluﬁ’, you say, doesn’t
den?”

“No. Our property ends at this wire fence.”

“I suppose the person who owns the bluff can't
ﬁnd a tenant for the house?” ,

“Nobody knows who the owner of the bluff‘ is‘,
and nobody seems to care. That house was t ere
when Mr. Warden bought this property. In fact,
it’s been there so long that nobody seems to know
when it was built.”

“Let’s go ug and look at it,” said’Jack.

He helped ora over the fence and to the top
of the bluff they ‘went. The house was a sub-
stantial structure and had stood the weather
mighty well, considering that it hadn’t been
painted or repaired within the memory of the old-,
est resident of that locality. The glass in the

‘ front windows, that faced the lake and conse-
quently were exposed itothe full sweepof the
winds across that big body of water, were broken

‘or cracked in the majority of cases; but those in

the rear, where a small one-story extension jutted
out from the main building, were in good shape.

Jack tried the doors and found them all _locked or

otherwise secured. _ , V
The window sashes were _also_ immovable,.._ so
that there was no way of_ getting into the building
without breaking in, and nobody had‘ attempted to
do that yet, during all the yeaﬁs the house_h_ad
, , «stood untenanted. In 'fact,‘ nobo _ in the vicinity
 ‘took enough interest in the bull ing to consider
it worth exploring. . - _
"I should think that if the owner was alive he
would either make use of his property or sell it

-fox‘ what it-m1ght«'f_e,tch,” remarked Jack, as he

' and Dora stood gazing at the old ‘structure. _ I

don’t see any sense in a solid—looking house like
that being abandoned to go to ruin.”
“My uncle thinks theowner is dead and that
he left no heirs,” said the girl. _
' “I guess he’s right. In that case it's a wonder
ithe property hasn t beensold for taxes.” _
, “The county has ‘just advertisedut for sale for

one way to in thinking. I have a great mind to
speak to Mr. arden about it." ’ .

“You can do so. He would help you if has ’
thought it was to your interest." .

They talked the matter over a while longer,
Jack growing quite enthusiastic over the’ project,
and then they returned to Red Gables. 4.

Mr. Warden was sitting on the veranda over- it 
looking the lake when they came up. He wan ' 

to know where they had been and Jack ‘told him.

. Dora went ipside and left them talking. ' 

“Would you like to see my collection of coins
and antiques?" asked the old gentleman at length. ..
“Yes, sir; very much indeed," replied Jack. ’

The master of the house got up and led the way ‘ <
to his library. The strong room where his col-
lection was kept was right ‘off the lib_rary,~and
protected by a steel door Witlia. combination’ lock
The old gentleman opened, the door 
and ushered Jack inside the doom. It was very x. ~
dark, as there were no windows to it’. Mr. War-
den soon threw light on the subject by pulling.
down an .old-fashioned bronze lamp, which hung 
from the center of the ceiling, and igniting ‘its :5
wick. It threw a soft glow about the gpartgnent. »_ 

“This lamp came from, an ‘ ancient tomb: in; 
Egypt. It is 3,000 years old at least, and. I pur- . 
chased it for $10,000. I consider it a bargain, for.
I could get twice that sum for it from any mu;-“-.
scum in the country.‘ Indeed, I was offered;4,000 ,
ﬁiunds for it by a representative of the British *

useum as soon as he inspected it.” p ’  _

Jack looked at‘ the old metal lamp in great won-‘ 
dei‘. He saw that it seemed to be a sort of well, _-
or receptable in ‘which a eculiar-looking wick
ﬂoated upon the surface of t e oil. His attention, _
however,_, was soon attracted ‘to otherthi s T‘
equally as ‘odd, and as he went from one artliitﬁe ~
to another‘ Mr. Warden gave him a brief history ‘
of the article with its age and the amount it had.
cost its present o’wner.« Altogether, the collection .
of vases, statuettes, brass, bronze and stone ornaé-_ »
ments, carved silver dishes of the ﬁfteenth and “
later centuries, and an. endless variety of small .
articles of every conceivable shape, was D‘l0StIl1_‘  -5
teresting and remarkable. ' _- _

Then Mr. Warden unlocked, his cabinetof rare’
coins—-gold,‘ silver, bi-ass,,bi-onze and iron ’spec'i- 9* «

took ‘xoutthe rarest 0 these and showed them to’ 1 g,.

Mr.‘ Warder over to his way of thinking. 3
“I’ve no doubt it could be bought in for less
than 1,000,” said the old gentleman, “but the

ing under age youcould not legally acquire real

“I’ll have the building cleaned out some day,"
he said; “but for the present things will*have to

One bright, sunny afternoon Jack and Dora
= ‘cramped gaily over to the bluff and took their

seats on a big stone at the back of the house.
From this point they could look out over the lake

‘around the corner of the house, while in the other

direction they had a ﬁne sweeping view, of the

countryside‘ for miles around. As they sat there .

in the sunshine it occurred to Jack to tell Dora,
about the strange legacy he had receiv-ed'from
Andrew Marven, and to show her the coin which
was supposed to contain the clue to a considera-

. ble treasure. So he told the girl abouttliat night, i

how the dying man had called him tothe bed and‘

then covered with letters and ﬁgures whose var- ’

CHAPTER XV.—Jack’s Fortune.

Leftxby themselves in the hut, the Cl001‘.0f which
the rascals took the precaution to secure on the
outside, Jack and Dora looked at each other. It
was all they could do, for the gags prevented them
from talking, and as they had been secured to two
of the posts that supported the roof of the cabin
they could not move. Both realized that they
were in a tight ﬁx from which they did not see _ i
how they could extricate themselves. Jack, how- 
ever, was not a boy to give up without a big strug-'
gle. The ﬁrst thing he did as soon as the Mexican
and Swivel had left the hut was to make an at-'
tempt to free himself fromihis bonds. In this he
was not very successful, as the rascals had tied T
him pretty securely. He kept working away,
however, hoping that he would eventually .succeed. ;

An hour passed away and the two rascals did .
not return. Jack judged that they must have had
some trouble in locating the exact spot where the
treasure was buried. At length the sun went‘

'- down, and the hut-, being situated in a secluded

nook in the bluﬂ’, the interior of,it grew dark ,
quickly. Just as Jack was beginning to -feel dis--V

to slip. his right hand out of the loop that held it. y ‘
He quickly tore the ga from his mouth. He got ‘V
his knife out of his poc et andcut‘ the rest of the - x
cords in short order.- Rushing to,where the girls 
wassecured he first relieved her of the ‘gag and  -

then released her from the post.

“What a_ terrible experience!'’- he e'aculated. V
“Do _you think we can escape from this ut? ‘I'm " V-;
afraid they fastened the door on the outside." _.

‘,‘.I dare say I’ll be able to break my way through

‘ the boards of the hut somehow," he said, after

making sure that the door was fastened on the ;.}d‘5

other side. v ‘ _ ' . i '
Pullingyout, his match-safe he struck alight and  .

looked around the cabin to,see ifthere was any

‘ kindof an implement he could use on the .boards. ’

his surprise at Guerr.ero’s fall Dora’s stick caught
.' him alongside the head and he went down, too.
Her blow was not very effective, and Jack had _to
hand him one to keep him quiet. a.

“Set the rope that was used to tie us, Dora, so
we can make these chaps prisoners.” -

She brought it, and Jack speedily tied Swivel
hand and foot. I-Ie ﬁxed the Mexican» the same
way, and relieved him of the copper coin which he
found in his pocket. He relighted the lantern, and
taking it in his hand called Dora to follow him.
He was satisﬁed the crooks would not be able to
escape from the hut, and he intended to have the

- police of Willowdale notiﬁed at once of their
whereabouts. ‘With the aid of the lantern light
Jack and Dora soon made their way to the top of

‘ s the bluﬁ. Jack’ ﬂashed the lantern around-the
rear of the house to see what the crooks had been
up to with respectyto the treasure. He found
that they had discovered the compass and shovel
he had brought out there that afternoon, that they
had located a spot about twelve feet from the
house, and in line with the old walnut tree, and
that they had done considerable digging. They
had left the shovel sticking in the hole, intending

. to return after visiting the ‘hut, maybe,’ for the
lantern. The sight of the hole, dug to the depth
ofabout three feet. ﬁred Jack's anticipations 6f
the, treasure. He deterinined to stay there and
xﬁnisli the job, sending‘ Dora to the Gables. i

"Dora, you don’t mind returning to the house
alone, do you?” he said.

.‘‘No; butwhat are’ you

“I'm going to finish the

1 ure.” ' .

i ‘Dora set off at once. and Jack, putting down

‘ ,’ the lantern. commenced working in thehole where
the treasure was supposed to _be. In half an hour
his shovel struck an obstruction. He ﬂashed the
lantern into the hole and saw that he had struck

a small brass-bound box.
“I've reached the treasure sure!” he cried
.. gleefully. “Now all I've ‘got to do is to_land it on

" the surface."

, ‘Unaware that there was trouble*brewing'for
‘ him close by, Jack jum ed into the hole again to
‘ put in the ﬁnishing stro es of his'work. While he
had beenia sorbed with his treasure digging ‘Dick

» Swivel had managed to free himself in the hut at

. .. the foot of the bluff. He qiiickly released the
Mexican. who had recovered his senses, and the
two, satisﬁed that the police would soon be after
them, started for the top of the bluff to ﬁnish dig-

. . ging for the treasure so that they could make off
:1  with it. To their surprise when they reached the
’ scene of operations they saw Jack Gardiner at
work in the hole. . ‘

“Carramba!” cried

‘ the treasure. ‘ ,

‘So’ much the better,” replied Swivel. “He has

him. This old tablecloth I brought to wrap the
“money in will do to smother him in till~we can
tieand gag him. Then we'll shove him into the
house and make off with the treasure.” . ‘
_ i As‘ Jack, after great exertion, landed the heavy

ment  Warden. _a neighbor, and Dora, armed
with revolvers, appeared suddenly on the scene.
The two rascals found themselves covered by the
weapons, and being called upon to surrender, did
so with very bad grace. Jack released himself
from the tablecloth and took a_hand in securing
them. The party then gathered about the brass-
bound box and looked at it with great interest.

Jack brieﬂy sketched the history o£ his strange , '0

legacy for the beneﬁt of Mr. Warden. and his
neighbor, and both congratulated him on ﬁnding
what promised to be his fortune. By the time he
had concluded William appeared with three po,lice- -
men from town. Theytook charge of Guerrero
and Dick Swivel and marched them over to the ‘
house, followed by the rest of the party, Jack and
William carrying the treasure box between‘ them.
The crooks were carried off in the wagon to Wil- ’

lowdale, while Mr. Warden, his neighbor, Jack ‘and  ‘ 

Dora sat down to ‘the belated supper. After ‘the
meal the treasureibox was opened in the library“
and found to contain $100,000 in American’ bills
and $10,000 in English gold. , p  ; j
Then -Jack was congratulated once ,more,,and ..
he turned the money over to Mr. Warden, who ,,
had been appointed his legal ardian, to,ke‘e 7 
for him. Three weeks later uerrero, Cutcli e
and Dick Swivel were tried, convicted and sent to ,
State prison for twenty years each, and Jack was  ‘
satisﬁed that he had nothing more to fear from ‘. L ' ‘
them, the Mexican particularly. After that time‘ ’ T
passed pleasant} __enough with Jack; He? had: ~ 1
made himself so id with Matthew Warden and "
Dora Davenport, and the future looked rosy-lined... ‘ , ,-
with one solitary exception—-the fact that his .  ‘~
father was in jail for life on the charge of mur~ 1 
der and robbery. ‘ . p _  .
One year from the time he" came to live at Red 0 ;;

knew that you were the wagon’ boy who delivered

, you actually did. Of course, he did not intend to

fracture your skull, but when he found that he
had knocked you out it was up to him to knock

“you again, so that he could ﬁnd out whom you

knew. Evidently he knew nothing of Doctor Pa-
jai-o’s true character, and the fact of his taking
you to the sanitarium was one of the strange coin-
ddences which have followed this case from the
start-. You are following me, I hope, Will? You
understand what I mean to convey?”
"I do," replied Will. “I have no doubt you are
right; but how can I tell?” ’ »
“You can't tell. We are groping in the dark.
I—well, what is it, Nell?"
\ .“I think you are missing the main point alto-
gether," put in Nellie Tighe. “According to Will,

' although Doctor Pajaro and oneof the examiners

'were in the vacant office at the time of the mur-
der, they did not have a hand in it.”
’ “So the doctor said.” \

of them, and he had already secretly determined 1 '
that in case the stolen diamonds shouldlby any j ‘
unexpected good fortune fall into his hands, there
was just one_ thing to do, and that was to take ~ *
them not to Madame Sandusky, but straight to _.
the office of Allen’s express. ‘ '-
Then, whether‘ or not the cloud which had now

FAME. AND FV(')lRlTU_NE‘iWEEKLY

it RIDE ‘FOR LIFE

The twilight was‘ rapidly deepening’into dusk
on a pleasant evening in‘ June, as a young horse-
‘man’ of twenty-two or three years of age emerged
froni*the forest path, and checking the animals
pace, paused for an instant or two contemplating
the scene before him. _ V

A‘ truly pastoral scene it was, though only a
settler?s humble clearing on» the very conﬁnes
of civilization, and to the young man it ‘was
the dearest spot on earth. _

' It" was the home of old Seth Morgan, one of

' the'fir’st of the hardy pioneers who more than

seven years before penetrated to these western
wildernesses, and out of the heart of the primeval

—:Eorest hewed ‘a. homestead for himself and famil .

It was not an excess of aﬁection for the har y
settler, however, that caused such emotion to ﬁll

lithe breast of the young man,'whose name was
 Edward Weston, but a far deeper feeling-the

strong‘ and passionate love ,he cherished for his

‘'1 . ‘oldest daughter, Clara, who was his afﬁanced
‘ Wife.: ' .

The girl returned his affection, and the follow-'
ing day had been appointed for,_the wedding.

' Already the guests had been invited, and more
about the

liandkerchiefs toward the expectant bridgeroom

i as hepatised for a moment after emerging from
x the forest. C ‘

Again, urging on ‘his horse,'in a few minutes

f longer he had reached the house, and'dismount-
.ing,., was -warmly greeted by the guests. i

,Another moriient, and his betrothed wife was
‘reast. ’ * i l ~

' Looking at them as they stood’ beside each

other, they made a singularly handsome .pair—.;

he sank unconscious to the ground- .,

‘When he again, came to himself the day was
breaking, and he was lying among the cold and
mangled remains of the wedding guests. _

. Staggering to his feet as recollection gradu-~

ally came back to him, a feeling of surprise
mingled with despair.  . C

While a few ..of the corpses were scalped and’

their countenances hacked and mutilated beyond
recognition, the majority remained untouched.

27 .

Another circumstances also attracted his at-s 

tention.
Among the

corpses there were no female ones

except that of Mrs. Morgan, and the conclusion-

naturally presented itself 2 that the rest of the
women had been carried off alive.

Clara might still be alive, and if she were his
life still had a. purpose. He would recover her,
dead or alive, from her savage captors, and
wreak upon'them such a vengeance as should
be remembered for years. ' V i

As he made this resolution he staggered to-
ward the little brook that ﬂowed’ past the rear
of the house, and laying his bro with the‘ cool

water, and binding up"his wound, in ,_a short time,’

', he felt stronger.

Fortunately, his horse had not been ‘placed

than half an hour‘, he was ready for his desper-
ate enterprise. ‘ .- C V

In the course of several hours in the saddle
the evidence of precaution the savages had used /

V , As he did. so the _noise aroused theisole occu-

pant of ‘the wigwam,, an“. Indian whose extra .

‘ adornments u on his’ dress showed him to be
a chief and w o, with a guttural ejaculation of
' mingled anger and surprise, sprang toward

him.

. The hatchet he had snatched from his belt was
upraised threateningly, and in an instant Ed-
ward Weston realized his position.’

It was no time» for hesitation, ,,and grasping’

his bowie—knife ﬁrmly he raised himself upon his
elbow and hurled it with all his strength at the
advancing savage. '

y The aim»was true, and without so much as a
single shriek of pain the Indian fell dead upon
the ground with the knife buried to the hilt in
hisfbosom- ' ’

Springing through the o ening the young man ,

bent over the prostrate ody, and seized the
knife to draw it from the dead chief's breast.
.. . Hardlyhad he done so than the blanket-over
. . i ' the doorway was thrown aside, and another sav-
‘ . age entered. ‘ _ ’ ~
For a moment he stood bewildered, and then

snatching the tomahawk from his belt, a wild ‘

-cry left his lips, and he sprang toward the young
man, the weapon upraised for the deadly blow.
' For ‘a moment also, Edward Weston had stood
in bewilderment, but it was not the entrance of
u: » the savage that caused his indecision.
‘ - ' _ As the ._blankets had been raised,-he had seen,
'passing around one of the capes in the. distance,’
a party of men, and among them he also fancied
