of San Benito,” said Ned Barry. as he and his

tone, as his eyes rested on the whiteywashed walls

.. . OR, THE SECRET OF THE THREE WRECKS M‘

. _r- -._U_....

Ned thought so himself, though he did not like ~
to admit it. . He was no match for the only child » _
and heiress of a proud and wealthy Spaniard, in
whose veins ran the blood of a long line of
hidalgos. And yet Ned was so badly smitten by y
the fair girl that he couldn't bear the thought of ‘ j

iving up what bore all the earmarks of a fruit-,

ess chase. He was an orphan boy, born on the
Paciﬁc Coast, and raised in a Spanish family on’

a ranch in Santa Clara Count , California. An
irresistible longing for the sea ad caused him to '.
run away from the ranch and ship in a bri‘ ‘' ,
bound for the Sandwich Islands. He had learns a ,*
to be something of a sailor on that trip, but was 
discharged with the rest of the hands when the g ‘ ~
brig returned to San Francisco. Thrown on his g . .
own resources. with little money, he was gladiito a
secure 9. berth on A rich broker‘: eel-it bound
_ er ultimate,
destination being unknown, who had shippedfor
the cruise at good wagesx T  . .-

Here he met Barney 0’Too1e, whose nautical '
experience was nothing to brag of, and the two; .
boys struck up a warm frien shi . After, one
or two stops since leaving San Francisco, the ~ 
yachtghad put into La Paz for a week’s stay » 
and most of that had already passed. ~ 3 V ,
crew was allowed unlimited shore leave, t the
hands were required to be aboard not later than;
nine o'clock each night. ed and Barney alwa ii‘

  

came ashore together and enjoyed t._h__ez'nselves n*

each.‘other’s company. This was a great advan-.1 . 
tage *_to Barney, who couldn’t speak a word of,’
Spanish, while Ned could convérse like a native’

 

Ned and Barne had been obliged to stay aboa
until relieved a ter dinner by two shipmates, who
returned for that pu ose, according to orders.
The boys had steere at once for a public gar-
den in La Paz, and there Senorita Pepita Cabi-v r
lero had ayrpeared in all the glory of a brand-. A
new manti la that‘ became-he_r brunette beauty
exceedingly. - -V _
' Ned was at good-looking, manly boy and the
senorita had found that it suited her fancy to,
engage in a mild ﬂirtation with him at a distance.’
The young sailor was completely fascinated by,
her, and when she, left the garden with an id:
duenna. who had. ¢h'31‘8e 0‘f_,her‘, Nedufollow’

‘ looking" mules and. trotted out of ‘town, Ned im-
‘mediately, bargained for a ride for himself and
-;companion; on a cart bound in the same direction.
‘The cart landed the boys at the ,public house in

 '— carried the senorita and the old woman up the
 ntle slope to the hacienda already mentioned.
god proceeded to inquire aboutthe identity of the
 lovely Spanish girl, and secured the facts stated
 by‘Barney, to whom he had told them. The young
’ sailor gazed gloomily toward the hacienda. Some-
where within its precincts that charming girl
wasmoving about, or»maybe seated in the por-
tico, or under the shade of a tree. ‘ _ -
 I "tLet’s take a walk up that way,” he said at
 as .
“Have yez the nerve to call on her?”
 ' g “I havethe nerve to do most anything the Way
g I feel,” replied Ned.
‘ 5,. ‘‘It’s hit hard yez are, I can see; but ye’ll get.
over it once yez are at_ say again," said Barney,
rising to acﬁompanv im. _ _
2 ' Ned felt kind oi; ‘diflident about going straight
up to the house. In fact, he didn’t. really think
of entering the cactus wall which surr.ounded the
building and which, but for the fact that the

 den all butits red adobe roof ‘tiles. He led the
“way by a roundabout route, and the two boys
. ‘were soon walking among the semi-tropical trees

’ ediwith green blinds, of the village. Finally they

“He pointed to"a thick clump of bushes, and
though Ned was for pushing on, he consented to

7.on, a_ rustic. bench when they heard voices and
- footsteps a nroaching from the direction of ‘the
Wvillage. T e newcomers soon appeared. One
'was. a small, spare man, dressed in a rather
shabby suit of white duck, his closely cropped

The crew of the schooner was astir early,.an
their_ﬁrst duty was to wash down _the deck.“ "B

» dry, breakfast was ready for them. Sanchez or.

dered Ned and Barneytto be brought u out-,_Io

looked around they saw the island lying with
a hundred feet of the vessel.‘ The openin "of
the larger outer cavern staredythem in the:_
like the mouth of a gigantic horn. Its‘ ﬂo
slopedbutward, and at high tide the water’ laved
about its entrance. At other timesa good patch
of beach intervened. The; boys breakfasted. with
the sailors, and then, instead of being r.eturned~
‘to the hold, were tied up, back’ to back, again”
the ‘forward mast. » _ ',,‘;‘V,
Breakfast was served in the cabin at {eight
o’clock, where Bruno and Sanchez partook'o,‘i"ii:
together, Pepita and her father being served’
their rooms. .After the meal the two-chief’:i'}_3.s-?
cals appeared on deck. A small boat‘ w,as~o

symshine-,again._ The passage was a short one,
nd terminated in a small inner cave. This cave
‘sloped: downward _and looked weird and g109mY
in the lantern light. Bruno Walked straight
~ across it and entered a second passage, which
sloped in the same direction as the cave, leading
»,into the depths of the island.
, ’- Like a criminal going to midnight execution;
.. ; Ned’s unwilling feet ke t pace with the tramp o
the two rascals. A ew yards ahead and an-
other cave. similar to the last one, was‘ reached.
No pause w made here, the party entering a
 narrow, assage, pointing downward, their
. arms brushing its rough sides as they passed
(through it. This passage was a long one, and
c yrried them below the evelyof the ocean, even
'9. low3tide.‘ - ‘
 But it had an end, likethe other tWo,'t_er-
minating in a small, rock—ribbed chamber, which
£h‘ad~no« other outlet. This was evidently their
destination, and Ned shuddered at the thought
sort’ being immuned in such a place. The slope
‘at the floor was sofsharp that the opposite side
fof the cave was fully six feet lower: than the
‘narrow platform around the opening of the”'pas.—
sage. Sanchez held the lantern high above his
head so as to illumine the place. Attached to the

   
  
 

—..wall.at the lowest side was a ‘big iron ring. To ~

‘ Ned's horriﬁed surprise, two skeletons dangled
from it, one clothed in the remains of a sailor’:
11% the other in female habiliments. .
, ' ~ How do you like the Death Cave, Senor Amer-
icano?;” asked Bruno, wickedly.

; ;.“Now will you tell me what youltold the sen-
orita about me, and how the information came
into your possession?” continued the ‘skipper.
. “No.” You have brought mehére to do away
 me, and nothing that I might tell you would
do me any good,” replied Ned, huskily.
‘ ‘-“By all above, I swear you shall’ return to the
I‘ light if you give me the truth,” replied Bruno.
 I“ can’t trust you, Senor Bruno. I can read
treachery" in your face. Do with me as you will,

;I!;will' tell vou nothing,” replied the boy, with the,

rmness of. despair. . l
" “You see you skeletons? They died as you
“ lhall ‘die, in the darkness and by drowning, like

‘ ppeared down a jagged crevice.

“Yes, my love. ‘ She was a pretty girl, almost,

which resembled that of Megzhistopheles at the  V

Ned, however,’ didn't believe that he could save,
his life by telling what Bruno wanted ‘to know. I

 toward ‘the schooner.

Barney, impatiently. “It's lucky we -are to get

‘. The boys walked out among the rocks and
started to look for shell-ﬁsh. While they were
busy engaged the crazy man suddenly appeared
, in behind a cluster of rocks that were sur-

on the deck ofthe forecastle.

A ‘groan and then the man said, faintly:

Ned tried to persuade him that ‘he was mis-~

“What can I do for you?” asked the boy.

AMERICANS LEAD AS ANIMAL COLLEC-
TORS, WITH TIGERS AND MONKEYS ‘

‘ AA’cc_ordi-ng_ to the newspapers of Calcutta
American millionaires are as great collectors of

wild animals as they are of old masters—-with 

this difference: the former are known to be gen-
uine.
the tiger, which can ‘be obtained all the »way
from $200 to $600, according to age, beauty and

previous condition of servitude. The next in pop-;

ularity is the monkey. Of this animal fully 200
are exported from Calcutta weekly.

The -Calcutta correspondent in The Morning
Post of London declares that before the World
War European zoos were the chief pui-chasers,,but

that early in 1919 Calcutta was inundated with.  If

orders from the East: “Prices ran high, and the

trade experienceda boom, for private menageries '_
had sprung up in many parts of the United ’

States, and competition among the wealthy pa.-
trons raised prices.” The correspondent thus

‘ concludes:

“‘The demand from America has never abated.
and is not likely to do so. Most big‘ houses in

" America are incomplete without private collec-
 tions, Which are added to practicallyevery month. } _ .
A few animals, principally monkeys, stray into‘ ‘

Europe, but these are mainly for vivisection pur-
poses. Germanyis the chief buyer in this re-

‘ spect. V ’ “ V - » ,

parrot or a monkey. When his ship reached Aus-
tralia hé might barter his monkey for a kangaroo.
People in Britain showed a lively interest in the
business; "miniature menageries were gradually
formed. “

“Finally a%entS were sent out to the ‘Eastilto 
s. Such menusually stayed in some , "

when they saw it. That may be lamentable, bug

went to no end of trouble to circumvent the,
itary red. tape, and they brought back witliffh _
their faithful dogs. ‘ _ ,r; “ ‘
There-was nothing sentimental about. i
good dog is a good dog.‘ Little did the ::
realize that the animals to which the _ V
attached and dependent upon would a ’ ew y
later be recognized in the oﬂicial stud book
that a society would be formed to pr’
them. , _ . ‘
Yet that is exactly what has happened;
information was recently containedm thefo,
publication. of the American Kennelclub with
comment, just a mere announcement. .  -z

The dog in question is the Briard-——Berg‘er
la Brie. There are only ten of them in the U13
States. It is possible that in time the‘ style
dogs will make the breed as popular as the“
man police dog. «  _

The Briard may be described as a cross beta?
the old English sheepdog and an Iris, '— . 
hound. He is taller than the sheepdog a__,
a long, coarse outer coat with a denser one ’ _
neath. His ears ‘are erect and his tail plu
The hind legs are double dew-clawed, a distindt-»
mark. His stern, sloping head denotes spee
power. The Briard can herd sheep or cattle,
care of children and drag a cart.; i ' « '
