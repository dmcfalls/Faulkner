flaw in it, and there had appeared to be no itmpedirnent

’ "to its success.

Now, however, everything was changed. .

The position taken by Carmen was a perfectly logical

it . one from her standpoint,

 She‘ saw in Inez Redenda anotherarnb-i~tions‘ wo“ma':n1
‘ like herself, and one .who~,,having once been the idol of

 

L .. all revolutionists, had now returned, after many years

, in prison eager to assume’ her own position with tliern;
1, eager to lead, and naturally quite as eager to reap the
:3 fruitswof such leadership. V

‘J Adelina did not believe that Carmen Carerra seri-
ously dqubted the identitygof Inez Redenda.

The charge that she was an inrpostor, which, al~
though literally true, as we know, was nevertheless
only the result of an impulse on Carmen’spart to grasp
at any straw which might rid herself of this interloper
, of a- woman who had so suddenly loomed in the horizon

of her ambition. V
C But it endangered Adel’ina’s position none the less
,because the charge was not sincere. The inflammable‘
and impetuous character of the engaged in the
c‘onspiracy»would-‘be easily inﬂuenced with suspicion
by any such charge made by Carmen.

’ The mere whisper that Inez Redenda, who had ap-

   
     
  
  
  
   
   
   
   
   
  
  
  
    
   
 
  

‘would have enough effect to interfere seriously with
all that Adelina had intended to do while playing that
character. _ 4 . 7

When Adelinawas leftalone she remai-necl for a long
time standingiwhere Carmen last saw her, wondering
what it was best to do next, for she realized that now
very little time would be afforded her to complete her
task. ,
, If, as she suspected, Nick Carter was a prisoner
somewhere at that house, no time must he lost in seek-
ing him. . ' ‘ T

 

to the rescue of Nick Carter, but we must not forget
that a mouse’ once helped a lion by gnawing the rope

enough to permit him toiuse his own great strength

' ‘ Presently she approached the door, and, ‘opening it
a- little, i'sto"ocl there listening. But she heard no sound
save‘ the noises from the streets outside and the occa-

‘ stairs in the servant’s pquarters. t
_ .. She wondered ‘what had become of‘ Don Iosé, and of.

stairs and there paused to listen again; thens she’

, she »fo‘n"ncl herself in an oz-clin2:ry' hallway of the second ‘
‘thot1glit+--— : t 

The front room: had its door standing open. and
Adelina, after perceiving that no one occupied it, passed.»
inside. ‘

It was unquestionably the apartment occupied by -

Don Jose and his wife, as various articles testified.
One hasty glance around, it was sufficient, and she

went again into the hallway, and noticed at one: that l
while she had been in the front‘ roonr the.dom' which

communicated between the rear one anti, the hallway
had been partly openetl as if to admit more air‘, for she

could see no person near it.

She passed. iorward. silently and peered: through the
aperture thus created; and then she gave’ a gasp of
surprise. . ' r ,2

Seated near a window, ‘engaged in -reading.,. and
with the glare oi the electric liﬁgtht shining full upon
his countenance, was jack Durland. T

He seemed not to be a prisoner ;: indeed he was ens‘
tirely at liberty, so far as appea.ra.neesvwent. T ' '

The time was yet early i»n.the‘evening,, and Durland

was fu-llryv..dressed2. He held a ha:lf~smo~l<ed cigar be-

tween: his ﬁngers, and his attention was ri*v'e1:ecl' upon
the book he had been reading. i L

Adelina studied the situation tor a: rriaonient,  i

then, relying upon her own. 1*’éSOuf€'§flJlﬁ8”SS,. she passed

si«l’en—tl‘y.-inito the room and closed the door behind: her,‘

turning the key of the lock as she did sol i
It was the click made by the turning key which.
startlecl Dnrland iintorthe lfrnoxvlfetlge that he was not
alone’, and he raised his eyes qntickly to discover, stand-
ing midway. between him and the door, a woman whom

.he‘7belIieved he  never seen before; ior although he

knew Aiclelina perfectly well‘ by sight, he had not recog-
nized her in her present character of Inez Reelenda.

Hie evinced no great amount of surprise, however,
or, if he did, it was not manifested. He spoke to: her

‘in Spanish, rising hastily from his chair as he did so,

and aSSLl1T1l11g_a11,3¥ttlt11Cl<E. of courteous expectancy.
Adelina regarded him in silence. V
For she had forgotten her disguise,. and when she‘

enteredtthe‘ ‘room where" he was seated it was with the Y
expectation of being instantly recognized‘. The factis
that he did not know her reminded her of ,who and

what she appeared to be. /' - ‘

Nevertheless, she carried out her original design,

‘believing that she had’. not misread the character of

Jack Durliandi, and‘. being thoroughly conﬁdent that she

could rely upon his chivalry, and his innate sense of s
3 /

honorable dealing.

and paused. He passed one vhand? across his brow

f.jA Adelina did not; for Durland, much better acquainted

known where that ﬁrst, house to which he had been

The hall was dark and they entered at once; then‘
paused to listen while Durland softly closed the door. ' .
Since entering the house they had not heard a sound” ~.

than that of her companion, thought ‘she caught the
murmur of voices near at hand, and she droppedto the

him to bay. There wasva reward of a hundred pounds of-
fered for information that would lead to his arrest. '
Tom said, in a casual sort of manner: “I’ll ju t see that
the horses are safe for the night,” and went oét, making
a swift sign to Hendrikto. follow. The latter waited a few
minutes, then got up, yawned loudly, and strolled outside the
cabin. A
“It’s the diamond-thief, right enough/,” said Tom, in a
‘hoarse whisper.
‘ “I think so,”‘ answered Hendrik. v
“Well, look here, I’ve thought it over, and .I’ll tell you
what I mean to do; VVe must wait until he’s asleep, then
I’ll slip out and ride to Five Pools. I can get there in less
‘than ‘a couple of hours, and will be back with help before
daybreak. There’s a hundred pounds reward, you know,
. which will mean ﬁfty apiece.”
“But supposehe wakes and ﬁnds you gone?” démurred
Hendrik. ,“He isn’t the sort to think twice of sticking a
‘ knife into a fellow’s ribs.” ‘ - ‘ '

“You have your revolver, and you must not let him be,

ﬁrst. I am quite willing that ‘you should ride to the town, '

but thejone is as risky as the other, for the moon has set, and
like as not I shall be tumbled off by a lion.’ But he won’t
wake easily when once he gets asleep. You saw yourself
how exhausted he is.” '

This plan was agreed upon. On returning to the cabin,
any doubts as to the drowsiness of their guest were at,once
dissipated. He had already ﬂung himself down close to the
smoldering ﬁre, his coat folded under his head, andwas
giving most unmistakable signs of the depth of his slumber.

Tom delayed not a; second. He saddled his horse, mounted,
and rode off. He had but the stars for a guide, but they
shone with brillianfsplendorin the darklblue dome o.§~the.

sky. A burning breath from the Kalahari blew in from the‘
‘ "west, but the rider turned his backiupon it, urging his animal
forward as fast as he dared, holding his revolver ready for

any emergency. - r *

whom he regarded long and critically. He was telling him-,
self that, concealed on the fellow, w-as a peerless diamond

‘ 51' histhqught served more to keep Hendrik" from nodding‘

than any sense of eril. He began'to wonder just where
the diamond”was hidden, and what it looked like.

“Itis probablylnin that coat under his,head,”' murmured ‘
" the watcher. I ‘  ‘

"At that instant Hendrik, perceived what he had not

In a moment the darkness swallowed horse and rider. The.‘- ‘
animal seemed to share its master’s panic, for it gallopedxg
madly forward through the bush, escaping a headlong fall;
by a series of miracles. For nearly an hour, the wild flight 
continued. ' ’ . » _ - "

Suddenly the horse came to a stop with such abruptnessﬁ
that its rider was all but ﬂung. With itsfore legs ﬁrmly:-.,

NEW NICK "CARTER WEEKLY.

Dawn was ‘breaking. As little twilight hellﬁre the full day
as after it on the African plains. The sun rose rapidly.

By that time Hendrik had sunk almost wais’.t-deep. He
felt that he was lost..

He heard a screaming high overhead, and looking up he

‘saw Carrion birds swinging in the blue vault. They began

to swoop-down toward him, their ﬁerce eyes ﬁxed upon hing,
menacing him with their curved beaks. '

Down and down! He had sunk as ffaras his olaest. , He
still -kept his arms free, still sent his hoarse, despairing cries
for help that would not come. Invisible hands appeared to
be dragging him down. Before ﬁfteen ‘minutes were passed
he w0ul(l have vanished from ‘sight, sucked down by this
terrible morass, and no one wouldever know what had
become of him.

A frenzy of horror swept throu h his brain, and he uttered

one ﬁnal yell, into which he put al the strength that 

to him.
Suddenly his heart almost stopped still, then pounded
furiously against his ribs. Surely his cry had been an-

- swered !

.He tried to renew it, but only a husky whisper issued
The suspense was intolerable. He felt
that his senses were leaving him, that it help came he would
not be able to respond to it. ~.
Suddenly the vultures flew up as they caught sight of an

I intruder. _A moment later a horseman appeared on the bank

of the gully. A cry of horror broke frim his lips.

The rider was Tom Fraser. -

As his eyes fell on his companion he grasped the situation
and rceived that not an instant must be wasted. Yet how

V, coul he save him? He could not descend into the quick:

sand, andhhe had no rope to fling to the other’s aid. His
ho'rse*s’ reins would-do, but they were not long enough.

Tom cast his eyes round in ‘agonizecl hewilderincnt, ‘and
they fell upon Hendrik’s horse, that was quietly grazi g near
with trailing bridle. '

“I can save him, but I must be
Tom..  . .

‘ In less’ than two minutes he had whipped off the reins of
both horses and than a noose. Hendrik caught it at the
second attempt, and ad just strength to get it under his

quick about it!” gasped

T _ar-ms, Then followed a terrific struggle. Slowly and surely
‘his body was drawn from the grip of the quicksand. Two ‘

minutes later and he lay upon the top of the bank, utterly
e')th»austed, pallld as death, With Tom’ forcing a little brandy

The spirit revived Hendrik, and he struggledito a sitting
posture. He now only remembered the situation in, which
he had placed himself. ‘What would he not have given to be
out of it! He forced himself to say, in the bamst whisper:

“Where—-‘where are the others?” »  , ,-

‘.‘There are no others,” he cried gaily. ’*‘I came ﬂack from

ago! That poor wretch. who came to our hut wasn’t Van

coiriciglence; that, togetherwrth his looks, put us on a wrong
scent. , , ‘ ,

‘Hendrik stared stupidly. .‘The ground seemed to swim
before his eyes. _So he hadn’t got the diamondat all! And

Tom went on speaking cheerrly.

ness; then his senses left him.. - “

He awoke forty~e-igh-t hours later, to End. himself in. the‘~

cabin, where Tom had managedto convey him. For the
greater part of that time hevhad been delirious.

Tom ‘asked no more questions, and Hendrik came to the
conclusion that he had raved but enough of the truth, during
his ‘spell of fever to enable_his companion to form a pretty
exact guess as to what had really happened during his ab-
sence‘. Ton: spoke. no word of reproach, evidentl . believin
that the other had been sutliciently punished by what he ha
suffered. And for this silence Hendrik was deeply grateful.

As soon as he was able, he got out dad mysterious packet

.he had wrenched from the stranget‘s- ﬁrlgers. The frag-

ment of sheepskin ‘contained a few eoi'nsr—e=a'mis'er-iahle sum of

money which the vagrant had gone to “sleep clutching, as if’

he feared he might be robbed. And indeed, his fear had in
a way been justified. Recover ng from his knock, he had
lost_n'o ‘time in making himself scarce.

Though ,iH‘endrik vowed to make ample restitution, he
never heard any more of the stranger, or set eyes on him
again. - -

FISH WITH A SAIL. *»

Few marine animals seem at first glance to betray less
intelli ence than the jellyﬁsh. Up with the tide and down
with t e tide, carried along by this or that eurrlent, moving
with the eddy of a backwater hither and thither, the jelly-
ﬁsh has become almostja synonym for helplessness.

Scientiﬁcally. of course, the popular idea of"the jellyﬁsh
is wholly mistaken; but it is perhaps only in tropical waters
that he is found in the perfection of intelligence. In the
South Pacific, iarotlnd the islaniis of Polynesia, and as far

sonth as the upper portion" of the North Island of New ’

Zealand, there is a jellyﬁsh who not only knows where he
wants to go, but is even provided with a sail which he can
and does hoist or lower at will. The sail, like the rest of
this curious animal, is almost transparent, but, unlike the
body of the ﬁsh, which is of the usual gelatinous construc-
tion, the sail is a membrane almost as hard as shell.

Roundabout the Ellice Group the navigating fish is often
,found with a sail measuring five inches across, and he navi-
gates the shallow island waters with the skill of a Hdoghlly
pilot,’ steering in and out of snaggy places and av‘oiding'ob-
structions, both above and below the surface, with unerrirrg
skill. Like his cousins in home waters, this navigating jelly—
ﬁsh has the power of stinging its natural enemies, and its
stingis fatal to ﬁsh and dangerous to man.

WHEY ANIMALS “ TALK.”

Silence is not absolutely necessary for the safety of wild
animals, says a naturalist who recently spent some time in
’African forests. Wild animals are not so ‘noisy and ‘talk-
ative” as are those of domestic life; but, then, the wilder
tribes of mankind are more taciturn than the civilized faces.

This is mainly due, in both cases, to the lack of social inti-
macy and nomadic habits. The carnivorous animals, the
onl natural cause of fear the other creatures have, de end
mainly upon their sense of smell. They also hunt by night,
seizing their prey while asleep. ’

_ The chimpanzee frequently breaks the forest's silence"by
answering the cries of~'other animals. The gorilla also will,
on occasion, break out;-into a ﬂood of ' speech, while other
monkeys’ are persistent chatterers, and at almost ‘any hour,
too.. . I  . ~ .

At night the trumpeting of the elephant and the bellow

of the hippopotamus are common. The antelopes also “cry” ~ —

at night when the leopard hunts them. ,
