necessary.”

“\Vell,” remarked the detective, “it isn't. The
baron is a man of great importance. I will be down
at once-—or, wait!”

He looked around the room. It was his library, a
place where he did not often take his visitors.

“You may show them in here," he added.

The servant withdrew, and returned a moment
later to open the door for two men of striking ap-
pearance.

They were very unlike. ,Baron Rubelik was tail
and slim, but straight as an arrow. He had bushy,

snow~white hair, and a snow-white mustache and

beard. In manner he was quiet and polite, and he’

spoke English like a native.

_a crown diamond ?"l

  

,2 NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

His companion, Jan Pallog, looked, to begin with,
as if he might be half as old.

He was a little above the medium height, but he
looked shorter because of his unusually broad shoul-
ders and stocky frame. '

’ His naturally dark complexion evidently had been
roughened and made darker yet by exposure to the
weather.

Pallog’s eyes‘ were black and restless, and he
seemed to dislike sitting still. VVhen. he spoke he
used English words correctly, but withua strong for-
eign‘ accent.

Nick shook hands with both, and asked therrito be
seated. .i i
- “It may seem strange, Mr. Carter,” said the baron,
“that I should come to you for assistance when I
have the secret service of my country at my com-
mand, but the matter that brings us here is so very
important that I would rather not trust it to anybody
less skillful than you are.” I
- “Thank you for the compliment, baron,” re-
sponded Nick. "I can understand that the ‘loss of

the crown diamond would disturb you a great deal.”

Pallogistarted violently, turning half-around in his

-chair to stare at the detective.

The baron was motionless, but his eyes opened
wide. '
i 1"The crown diamond!” be repeated, in a tone of
the deepest surprise. ' ’ " ' '
“yes,” said Nick, quietly ; '“it has disappeared, and

“Are you a wizard ?” demanded Pallog, abruptly.
"'NiJ,” replied Nick, “I_ am a detective.”

 "But how did you know that the crown,diamond

had disappeared? ‘How did you know that there was

with men who commit crimes, but such men are not
always professional criminals.” I I

“Mr. Carter,” said the baron, eagerly, “you have
stated the business which brought us here as accur-
ately as I could have stated it myself. I beg you to
give us the whole of your information at once. Do
you know what has become of the crown diamond?”

“I do not.”

The baron looked disappointed, and Pallog moved ‘
restlessly in his chair. I

“I wish you’d tell us how much you do know, ’ i
then,” muttered Pallog. A I A I I I"
“Willingly,” said Nick. “To begin with your soc-
ond question, I have friends in every_ businessiiin the I
city. They know the sort of things I like to k_r_iow '
about. One of them told me two days ago about

a diamond of wonderful value that had been shown
to him. His opinion‘ had been asked as to its
value.” A H ‘-

get a look at it. After that they would ﬁght any-
thing.”

“I shouldn’t have thought they would like to part
with the diamond.”

“They didn't. It was easy enough to buy it of the
king, but his generals and others got on to the deal,
and they made the hottest kind of a time for me try-
ing to get it back. I believe they killed the king be-
fore they got through, and they nearly did for me
more than once.”

“There is no need to say that Mr. Pallog escaped,”
said the baron, “for here he is. He intended to re-
turn to Roumelia by taking a steamer from Hong
Kong for London, where he meant to have the dia-
mond cut, but his vessel was wrecked among the
Philippine Islands, and, after many adventures, he
at last got to Manila. _ From there he came to San
Francisco and so to this city.

“He reported to me, of course, and showed me the
diamond. I "thought that we might get the stone
cut in New York, and so we showed it to several jew-
elers.

“They astonished us when they told us how valu-

able it was. We knew that it was worth a great deal,
but we had no idea how much until they mentioned

. ﬁgures that you would hardly believe.”

“I heard the figures,” said Nick, “and yet I un-
derstand that the stone was not very large.” ~

“No, there are larger diamonds in the world, but
none as valuable as this. You see, the savages had
cut it’ in their own way, so that it shines wonderfully
now. It will need only a little more cutting to make
it ready for the queen’s cro.wn.”

"‘When'we get it,” grumbled Pallog.

“Yes,’$ added the baron, nervously, “when we ‘get .

it, What do you think, Mr. Carter?” ‘

“Why,” said Nick, "I hayen’t begun to think yet, ’
for I don’t know how the diamond was lost, but I can .

say right off that I believe the stone is still in ex-

. isténce?” ' -

“And therefore,” said the baron, “it seems to me
that it ought to be found.”

“When did you last see it?” asked Nick.

“What time of day ?”

“About four o’c.lock.”

“Where were you?”

“In astore on Maiden Lane.”

“VVhich one ?”

“It was in Baldwin's, wasn't it, Pallog ?”

“Yes,” said Pallog, “that was the last place we vis-
ited.” '

“Did you two separate then?”

“Not at once.”

“Tell me just what you did.”

“We walked down Broadway to Bowling Green. I

“I told them that in my country it was much the
same as their ula nut, and I took a chew of it.

“At my invitation each one of them took a lit
of theweed in his mouth.”

Pallog stopped his story to laugh.

“I suppose they didn’t like it as well as their ula
nut,” remarked Nick.

“I should say not!" chuckled the traveler. “They
are very polite fellows in their way. and it was aw-
fully funny to see them trying to keep their faces
straight. They didn’t want to Show that they didn't

“Two of them swallowed the chew, and of course
they were made sick by it.

“That scared the others, and they might have
thought that I was trying to poison them, but, you
see, there I was chewing away on the very same
weed without suffering from it.

“So I explained how the stuff should be used, and
told them that nobody ever liked it the first time, and
offered the ula not again to take the taste out.

“They were glad enough to accept then, and after
that they left me, quite satisﬁed that I hadn't the
diamond.

“Meantime, of course, the stone was in my pocket,
safe in the box you now have in your hand.”

“It's a good scheme,” said Nick, looking thought-
fully at the open box. "If I undertake the case, will
you let me keeplthis box for a little while?”

“Certainiy. We of no further use to me, I am
sorry to say.” i ‘

now with a good deal of pleasure.”

“But, tell me, is it true that you have found the
diamond ?”

“I did not ‘say so.”

“You said you knew where it was."

“That’s quite another matter.” \

“Yes, but if you know where it is. why not go and
get it at once ?"

, “Baron,” said Nick, gravely, "I cannot tell you
why. If I succeed in getting the stone, and I expect
to, I will then tell you all my reasons ”

“And this mystery?”

“Oh, as to that, you can see that a detective must
have good reasons for disguising himself. I usually
do my work that way, but I’ll explain it all whenithe
work is ﬁnished." ' -

“Well ?”

“I am here to say that I will undertake the case.”

“I should say that you had undertaken it already.”

“Yes, perhaps, biit the work is only just begun.
You must now trust me absolutely.”

“I do. There is no question about that.”

“Very well; you are not likely to see me or hear
from me again for a long time.” y'

“Why, knowing where it is, can’t you get the stone
to—day or to-night ?” ‘

. “Possibly, but it is most unlikely.”

“W'ell, you know best.” 1

“I certainly do, baron."

“You really think that youwill be able

“He would feel solmuch better,” he urged, “if he
knew that you had a good clew. Perhaps you don’t
realize how terribly this matter has affected him.
He's a cool sort of man, and doesn’t show his feel-
ings much to strangers, but to me he has seemed al-
most crazy with disappointment.”

“Oh, well,” said Nick, “I wouldn’t want the man
to suffer. If you see him again---”

“I expect _to this evening.”
“Then you can tell him that Mr. Carter has taken
the case, and that he got track of the man he was
looking for.” A -

him, but it will be better that he should not know any
more about this than he does now.”

The puzzled baron assured Nick that he would be
careful, and the detective went away.

 

CHAPTER IV.
THE DETECTIVES DRAW’ LOTS.

As Nick left the building, Pallog walked in, but the
traveler did not recognize the detective. '
Nick went home, and without delay called Chick
and Patsy to the library. ~
They did not know until then what it was that had
been keeping him busy during the day.

_He told them about the call of Baron Rubelik and
Jan Pallog, and about his visit to the Astor House.

“Now, then,” said he, “this is a case for‘ all of us, as
I shall show you in a minute, and I think it is the
most peculiar case we ever handled. It is peculiar
because, while something of immense value has un-
doubtedly been stolen, we can't make any arrest.”

“I should like -to know why not?” cried Patsy.

“VVait a second, my boy. You’ll see when you've
thought a bit. The ﬁrst question is, who’s got that
diamond?” I

“Pallog!” guessed Chick and Patsy together.

“Right! I suspected the man from very early in
the conversation in this room, and I was careful to
lead him on, while he thought he was leading me, to .
admissions or remarks that seemed to back up my
theory. I

“He was tempted when he discovered, by showing
the stone to New York jewelers, how valuable it is. .
Then he planned to rob himself. He‘ might have
done that a little better. Forinstance, if he had
brushed the dust from his ‘transom I‘ might have
thought that perhaps somebody ‘did get into his
room. ~ He forgot that, but, on the ‘whole, he has
done very well, and he has deceived Baron Rubelik
completely.” . I A . ~

“It strikes me," said Chick, “that the -baron'hir£!—_ ‘
self might beam the deal.” ‘ - I

“The same thing struck me, of course,” responded
ick, “and I put it to the test. I called on thebaron‘
in disguise, and startled him by saying that

__ ‘What evidence did Pallog give against himself
while he was here 3” asked Chick.

,.., “Well, I sized him up for a man who didn’t 'care
ﬂ much about.right or wrong from his account of the
’ away he dealt with the savages. Then there was this
box. -That seemed to show that he was a trickster.
I could have opened it the first time trying, but I let
him believe I couldn’t so as to hear him talk. Then,

“But first let me show you why there can be no ar-
rest.”

“I see,” said Chick.

“And I begin to,” added Patsy.

“VVhat’s your reason, Chick?"

“Why, just this: If I should arrest Pallog and ﬁnd
the diamond on him or in his baggage, he would say
that he was the representative of the Roumelian Gov-
ernment, that he had a right to it, and he was simply
performing his duty in carrying it. There isn’t a
court in the world that wouldn't say he had the right
of it.”

“Exactly,” said Nick. “He would beat us hands
down. But if we don’t deliver that diamond to the
Roumelian Government nobody ever will.”

“Say!” interrupted Patsy, “has the Roumelian
Government any right to it ?”

“I’m not sure,” replied Nick, soberly. “Baron
Rubelik says yes, for he bélieves that the stone was
bought by Pallog in a fair and honorable deal. I
think he stole it, or got it by fraud, but I don’t see
how we can argue such a matter.”

“No," said Chick, “for Pallog has no right to it.
The government employs us to get something that
it bought. That’s as far as we need to go.”

“I think so,” was Nick’s response.

.“Then,” said Patsy, “this job is just this: Get that
diamond. That’s all, isn't it?”

“No. It must be handed to some oﬂicer of the
Roumelian Government.”

“Oh, cert, but it’s a case of get the diamond first.
If Pallog should get to London with it he'would have
to be shadowed to a jeweler’s.” '

“Yes, and he could be exposed there, but he’ll be
a hard man to shadow. I hope the diamond can be
found before he gets to the other side. ’ You see,”
and Nick smiled queerly, “if he finds that the stone
has been taken from him he can’t say a word, for that
would be the same thing as confessing that -he robbed
himself here in New York.” ,

Patsy smiled queerly, too, and Nick then went on
to give each of them a copy of the note of informa-
tion that the baron had written.

All the notes were in the name of Nick Carter.

“Whateverehappens,” he said, “we’ll meet in Lon- «-

don unless there’s a shipwreck, and we will go to the
Let's draw lots now."

They‘ did so.

Nick drew the American Line, Chick the Vi/hite
Star, and Patsy the Cunard.

“This means a week’s vacation at sea for two of
us,” said Nick, with a laugh, “and a mighty good
job for the other. By the way, I’ve ﬁxed it so that
each of us has a stateroom very near the one that
Pallog has engaged. If he goes on my boat I shall-
be next door to him. If he’s on your boat, Chick,
he’ll be across the gangway. On Patsy’s boat he’s
two rooms down the gangway on the same side.”

“Might about as well be on another ship,” grum-
bled the young man.

Nick laughed again, and they went to their rooms
to get ready for the voyage

W’ hen they met at dinner Chick said:

“By the way, Nick, what about that black man who
called at the Astor House and inquired for Pallog?

, Was. he a fake ?” ,

“No,” replied Nick. “I asked the clerk about

him. There was just such a man, and a very odd-
- looking fellow, too, from what the clerk said.”

“A man from Borneo?”

“Possibly. I really thought for a half—second that
that man complicated matters, but I don’t now. He
may have come from ‘Borneo after that stone, but I
shall let Pallog attend tohim.” .

"What if the black man should try to-night to get
into Pallog's room?”

“He’ll get caught, that’s all. Pallog will have him
locked up, and then will take one of those boats for

_ Europe. Nothingbunder heaven will prevent Pallog
', from sailing to«morrow. So I don’t care what hap-
i pens to the black man. '
‘_‘Pal1og bought, tickets by three lines, of course,
because he feared he might be suspected, and he
wanted a chance to dodge pursuit. We’ll let him do
’ as he pleases, and to save ourselves trouble we will
go aboardithis evening.” 4

my mind was made up as soon as they called, for I

» knew that it would be an interesting problem.”

The detectives then said good-by to each other,
and each went to his boat. '

It is hardly necessary to say that the name of Nick
Carter did not appear on any passenger list.

Nick had bought tickets under the names Brown,
Harris and Mallon, the last name being the one that
Patsy had to assume.

Neither Chick nor Patsy had seen Pallog, and,.

though Nick had described him carefully, it was not
supposed that the description would amount to much,
for, if he did not travel under his own name, it was
likely that he would disguise his appearance as much
as possible.

The traveler’s name on the Cunard Line was Brod-
ski, and Patsy knew that it wouldn’t be more than a
day or two before he would know who Brodski was
without asking questions—that is, if Pallog came
aboard—for ocean travelers get acquainted very
quickly and it is always easy to identify persons by
getting their names from the printed list and then
noticing where they sit at the dinner-table.

Patsy went aboard the Umbria, the Cunard steam-
ship that sailed at that time, without an idea in his
head as to what he should do except that he would
study his man. -

He didn’t believe that it would be_ his luck to
travel with Pallog.‘ and he looked forward to spend-
ing most of his time during the coming week reading
books in the ship library, /

He loafed away the morning of the sailing day,
smoking and reading the New York papers.

When it came near noon, and ‘passengers were
coming aboard in crowds, he took more interest in
what was going on. ‘

Of course he looked for Pallog, alias Brodski,
among the passengers who had already come aboard,

but he saw nobody who looked at all like theman My

Nick had described. .

Ten minutes before sailing time he leaned agains ii
the rail of the promenade deck and lookeddown It _

the dock.

Several hundred persons were‘ there to bid fare‘

well to friends on board. _
Delayed passengers were hurrying up the gang

plank and longshoremen were standing ready to,ca‘st:

to watch the messenger that a man in the crowd on
the dock made a signal to one of the passengers.
Plenty of men might have seen this signal, but
they would have supposed that the man was simply
waving a farewell to a friend on board.
The friend stood within six feet of Patsy.

After the signal, the man on board looked from

one to another of the passengers near him, and

ﬁnally jerked his thumb towards Patsy, while he
looked inquiringly at the man on the (lock.

The latter nodded. '

Then the man on board took a quick, keen glance
at the detective and walked rapidly away.

Patsy staid at the rail until the boat was in mid-
stream.

‘ “Well,” he said to himself, “it's good-by to New
York for a while, and nothing doing. I wish there
was a dynamiter or an escaped forger, or somebody
on board to make things interesting.”

He went to pacing the deck while the steamer
sailed down the river and into the bay.

Just oﬁ the Battery a steward spoke to him.

“Beg pardon, sir, but you're Mr. Mallon, aren't

' you P”

It was the steward who had charge of Patsy’s
room, which accounted for his knowing the pas-
senger’s name so early.

“Yes,” replied the detective.

"Beg pardon, sir, but I think I saw a telegram for
you.” -

“So P3.

“Yes, sir. There’s a number of telegrams and let-
ters on the head table in the saloon, sir.”

“And you saw my name?”

‘"1 think so, sir."

“Get it for me, please.” _ ,

l‘”l‘ha'nkee, sir,” said the steward, pocketing the
tip that Patsy gave him. i

He went below and returned in a moment with a
yellow envelope. ‘

said, (‘by a kid who nearly got carried off with us."

CHAPTER V.
OVERBOARD.

The explanation of that telegram may as well be
e iznade at this time.

Nick had spent the night on the American Line
steamship St. Paul. He breakfasted on board, as did
the few passengers who had come on the evening be-
fore. as he did.

“He was not exactly surprised, but he was greatly
interested, to see Pallog at the breakfast-table.
V The traveler had disguised himself to the extent of

He went down to the chief steward’s room.

“I wonder if I can get my seat at the table
changed,” said Patsy.

“Well,” responded the chief steward, “it's rather
late to ask' that. Aren’t you the gentleman I fixed
last night?” i ‘

“Yes, you gave me a seat then, and it’s good
enough, but I'd like to change if itwvon't be any
trouble.” ‘

“It's nothing I care anything about, but all the
people on board, so far as I know, have been ﬁxed,
and they're likely to kick if I, shift them.” ‘ i

"Perhaps it won’t be necessary to shift anybody. ‘
Just let me see your table plan. If t'.2ere’s anybody

He leaned upon the rail at a point about amidships,
and looked down at the water. V 4

There was nothing to interest him there, he hardly
saw the splashing waves, for he was trying to think
out a plan for getting the diamond after having iden-
tiﬁed Pallog, when he was suddenly lifted into the air.

\Vithout the‘ slightest warning, with no word ut-
tered, he was raised clean off his feet and dropped
over the side.

As he went down. clutching at the rail and missing
it, he had a brief glimpse of a horribly evil face leer-
ing triumphantly down at him.

The man who had thrown the detective overboard
walked hastily_ away, and disappeared in the first
gangway_ he came to.

Nobody had seen the deed.

The chief engineer but a second before had turned
into his room and ‘shut the door.

The sailors‘ away forward were busy with their
work. '

On the bridge the oﬂicers were looking ahead.

Aft there was a man.’ on duty. and at that moment
he was gazing toward the"faint"blue line of shore.

The trick had been done as successfully, so far as
escaping observation went, as if it had been dark-
est rnidnight. T ~

But luck that gave the villain his opportunity was 4

not entirely. on his side.
There was luck for the astonished detective, too.
As hewent sliding down the side of the vessel,’
tearing the ends of his ﬁnger nails off in the effort to
catch on to something on the iron freeboard, he felt
the rim of a port hole. ‘ ‘ -
It was on the leeward side of the vessel, and the
port was open. I
The feeling of the rim was
mind. _ A .
He lmew what it meant. 2
Instantly his -muscles obeyed his will; ,
One hand had slipped from the rim, which was too
smooth to hold to without time for it, but the other
swept out and caught the circular window. ‘
As‘ the reader may know, these‘ windows of an
ocean steamship are made of very thick glass framed
in heavy  brass. A. __ ,

splash spray into the port, the window had been
‘pushed partly open. 4 _

.. The brassirame, therefore, stuck out a little from
the side of the ship, and that was what enabled the
detective to grasp it.

He hung to it a moment, gasping.
As soon as he had clutched it with one hand, he
brought the other toiit also.
For a moment, therefore, he was safe.
Below him were the tumbling waves, and above,
far out of possible reach, was the deck-rail. .
He was too strong to be shaken off by the rolling
of the vessel, but he could not hang on there for-
a ever, and there was no telling how long it might be
‘  before at sailor or passenger would edisc_over his re-
. markable situation and aid him. ‘
Aiter the first shock of amazement, ‘Patsy wasn’t
‘ sosure that he wanted to be discovered.
_' “Of course that was Pallog,” he muttered, grit-
- ting his teeth. “It might be a rattling good scheme
j . _ to let him think that  in the sonp-for good.”
 ’ Then he thought  the attention of the
“passenger in the room .and_gEtting him to help him
. over the rail and say nothing about it.
“That would be a beaut in the way of a return

The detective crowded his headfurther into the
opening.  ' -

. “Huh!” he grunted, “empty. All that talk wasted."

He drew back and let himself hang for a moment
as easily as he could while he thought about it.

Looking up and along the rail he saw not a face..,

In pleasant weather, or after a day or two out.
there might have been a dozen persons looking over
to whom he could have called.

“Well,’_’ he muttered, presently, “the situation isn’t
getting any better so far as I can see. The ship must
have gone a mile since I went over. I can't stay
here till we get to Europe.”

He looked again at the porthole.

“I shall have to try it,” he concluded. “Lucky Yin
not built on Nick’s lines. He'd have to leave one -
of his shoulders ‘outside it hewent in there, and per-
haps I will."

Patsy had thought of the possibility of climbing in
through the porthole at the first, but he had northe-
lieved that it could be_d_gge.

The opening seemed too, small.

It is surprising what a narrow space an average-
sized man can get through when he has to. 

Patsy found that he didn’t have to leave a shoul-
der outside. ‘

It was by no means easy getting through, espc- ,
cially as there was nothing to brace his feet against,‘ . ,
but, by squirming and twisting, he managed it, and _

He cautiously leaned his head and shoulders over
the edge of the berth and looked down.

It was too dark to see what he wanted, and he had
not taken his pocket lamp with him, but he had
brought a few matches tied to a button of his under-
shirt.

He lit one of these in such a way that the rays
would not fall on the sleeper's eyes. for he feared that
the flash might arouse him. '

Then he took a hasty glance down again.

Pallog lay face up and his lips were parted. ‘

“Good!” thought Patsy, blowing out the match.

He leaned over the edge again and reached the
ether-soaked sponge down until he could lay it on
Pallog’s lips.

In a second or two there was a change in the man‘s
breathing that the detective understood, and he
climbed down to the ﬂoor.

A little more ether was dropped on the sponge.
after which Patsy turned on the electric light without
hesitation.

His first search was made under Pallog's pillow.

The man breathed steadily when his head was
raised.

Patsy found nothing under the pillow, except the
traveler's pistol. He took it out and sat do\vn to ex-
amine it, for it was unlike any he had ever seen.

It was not a revolver, but something like the old-
fashioned, single—barreled weapon that used to be
known years ago as a “horse pistol.”

The barrel was very large. A bullet from it would
have taken the top of a man's head of? if it was fired
right. '

It was not loaded from the muzzle, however. The
breech could be raised by a spring, as Patsy found
while he was looking the thing over.

Havingraised the breech, he saw that the weapon
was heavily loaded.

‘'1 might as well draw the charge,” he thought.
“Otherwise, if Pallog should happen to wake tliere
might betrouble.”

He drew out the charge and ‘thrust it into- his
shirt, putting into the barrel in place of it a small ar-
ticle that he had brought along in the same way he

4 did the matches.

, Then he replaced the weapon under Pallog‘s pillow
and continued his search.
There wasn't much to search. .

clothes and turned up the cushions of the bunk with-
out ﬁnding anything that interested him.

At last, with a very sober expression on his face,
he drew a long breath and turned oﬁ the light.

“The ether won’t last much longer,” he said to
hiznself, “and I will have to be going.”

He went back as he came, except that he returned
feet foremost, for he had to replace the grating over
Pallog’s ventilator as he had found it.

Pallog was about the ship as usual on that day,
and when land was sighted late in the afternoon he
told an officer that he was going ashore at Queens- u
town.

The detective, who was watching him more nar-
rowly than ever, heard of this, and prepared to land
there also. ‘

He left his thunk on the boat’, with orders to have
it forwarded tothe Tavistock Hotel, London, for he
didn’t want to be bothered with it, and took only his
grip with him on the tug that came out to the Umbria
from Queenstown.

Pallog did not discover that the detective was one o 
the tug with him until just as it was about to start up  
the harbor.

Then he hurried toward the gangplank, as if he
would return to the steamer. M V

Patsy did not stir, for he saw that
already being hauled in. M

If Pallog had really wanted to go back on board 
the Umbria he could probablyyhave managediit, but»
he seemed to think it might be as well to staylwhere,
he was, for he went sullenly to the cabin, and sat].

All that Pallog saw him take from it was a cigar.

“I hope you don't object to smoking?” said the de-
tective.

“I object to you I" cried Pallog. “Do you know
that you're looking into a loaded gun ?”

He put up his thumb and cocked the weapon.

Patsy bit off the end of his cigar.

He kept his hand near his face, as he remarked:

"You're not going to ﬁre that gun."

“,\-Vhy not ?"

“You know too well for me to tell you.”

“V\"cll, then," cried Pallog, “I can use it in an-
other way!”

With this he brought the gun up, caught it by the
muzzle and aimed a blow at the detective.

Patsy then brought down his hand about six
inches.

The cigar dropped to his knees. bht there was a
small revolver in his hand, cocked, and aimed
straight at Pallog’s heart. V

“You know something about sleight-of-hand,_I be-

A Strange Company.
(By Earl Moody, Ky.)
_ Once on a time a man went into the woods to cut
wood. He dug up a tree and in its roots found a golden
goose. He too; it in his arms and started for the village.

On the way there a hawk swooped at the goose.
When its bill touched the goose it stuck to it. An eagle
saw the hawk and swooped and caught it and stuck also.
I‘_1ext a fox, seeing the eagle helpless caught its leg. A
lion caught the fox. Thus they went to town.

In the town, he heard of a king who had a daughter
who was beautiful, but never laughed. The king had
oﬁered her in marriage to any one who could make her
laugh. The man went to the place and was admitted.
When the princess saw him she burst out laughing.

They were married and lived along time in happi-
ness. V

I ,. An Adventure.
(By Rory McBartlett, St. Louis, Mo.)

' _ One time a few other boys and I went on a ﬁshing trip

to a pond about two miles away from my grandfather's
house in St. Charles County, Missouri, and we had
trouble right from the start. First of all, I conldn’t ﬁnd
my ﬁshing pole, and after that I couldn't find my reel,
and then my hooks and lines and lunch and coat and hat
were all in cliﬁerent places. Mamma says I never know
where anything is-

When we got in our boat after arriving at the pond
we pulled and pulled at the oars until we were nearly
dead, but could not move the boat a foot. Finally after
about an hour of useless eﬂort, we discovered that some
mean man had-tied a rope toa ring on the bottom of
the boat and fastened the other end of the rope to a stake
driven in the bottom of the pond under water, so that
even grown people couldn't have guessed what on earth
was the matter. The result was we didn’t catch any ﬁsh
and were all tired, mad and’.snoburnecl for nothing. If
we ever ﬁnd out who tied that boat we won't do a thing
to him.

United States Copper Coins’.

Some rare varieties of coins, specimens of which are
now sold at big premiums.

Two Cents.—-This coin first appeared in 1864, and
was discontinued in 1873. The alloy was the same as
the cent of the same period. and its weight 96 grains.
"2 Cents," in two lines, is enclosed by two half wreaths
of wheat, tied at the lower end. Legend: “United States
of America"; reverse similar in design to the nickel
Five Cent pieces, only the legend is in a scroll. and the
crossed arrows, upon which the shield rests, seems to
support its center instead of its base. The Two Cent
piece of 1872 is scarce; that of r873, being only in proof
sets, is very scarce. V

One Cent.——-There are four pattern cents bearing the
date 1792, whether made in or designed to be used by
the U. 8. Mint is uncertain. They are all extremely
rare. The largest, which exceeds the half dollar in size,
has on the obverse a head of Liberty with ﬂowing hair,

which rtly covers the bust on both sides, and faces to—
wsrdit e observer's right; the date in large ﬁgures is

iinniediately beneath the bust, and the legend is "Lib-

erty Parent of Science and Industry." On the shoulder
of the bust is the name of Birch; on the reverse, in the
center. are theiwords “One‘Cent," surrounded by s cir-
cle; this is surrounded by a wreath, and it again by the
le end ‘ ‘United States of America.” ‘

be second in size is a triﬂe less in diameter than the
half dollar. Obitersez Anaked bust of Liberty, facing
right, with the hair conﬁned by a band and knot, be-
neath it"r792,"aboveit“Liberty." Reverset Auesgle

,( A Warning to Collectors.

One of the latest kinds of counterfeiting is the imita-
tion of old coins for sale to the numisiizatists. One of

the most ingenious modes of deception in this class of‘
A work is the changing of the dates ofsonie cornruou issue

of a certain coin to, the date ofpa year whose issue is
scarce and consequently high.‘= '
The old Liberty dollarof 1804 is very scarce. It is

‘ said that there are only seven genuine coins of this

issue in this country. The coin’ is rated in numisrnatic
catalogues at a value of $1,200 and upward. The conn-
terfeiters have been quite successful in changing t8ox
issues to that of 1804. This is not counterfeiting in the
strict legal sense of the word, and the Treasury oﬁicials
would not be able to punish any one for this class of
ofiense. But they have exercised their power to put a
stop to such work wherever they have found it going on.
