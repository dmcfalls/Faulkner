He makes a last fearful effort to get rid of his

His right arm is free for an instant.

He raises it high and brings it down with all his '
M force. '

There is a dagger in his hand. _ ,
t seems that the ﬁrst Aman perceived the danger of
such a blow in the dark, for he leaps "suddenly aside.
Down comes the weapon.
The point hits an iron shelf over the ﬁreplace.
Snap! the weapon breaks in two close to the hilt.
The blade falls to the floor. A
With a,curse the _man who held the dagger drops
the hilt.
The blade fallsto the ﬂoor.
Now that he is free from his enemyA_.‘and also un-
armed, he turns to another door that he knows of and

rAuns out.

AHis enemy lets him go’ withouteffort tograpple

.with him again. "

Instead of keeping up the ﬁght, the man leaps" to-
ward the spot where he heard the dagger blade fall
ringing to the floor.’

T “It isAthe only Chance for escape,” he mutters.’ “I

Another instant and that somebody will burst the

pdoporpin as he did the other one.

i‘»‘AIt’s the only way,” the man mutters, again.
VVith the quickness of a cat, he drops to the ﬂoor.
The broken blade of the dagger is under him.

ger upon his breast iAn such away that, if iticould be

Then there is a sudden bright glow from a_‘p0(§A‘ket AA\A‘.‘t

The light shows him one of the criminals he is after

He tips up theyedge of the carpet and: tucks the‘ ~V

Then he rises and darts silently into the room Al V’
where the fight began. ‘ A A
From the rooms beyond he hears sounds that shAo’wA A A
that the detective who ﬂashed a light on himhas m¢t...»..:s
with resistance. ' A T A:

‘JLISE then they both hear the voice of the detective

Iliéy hear these words:

The criminal’s arm seems paralyzed for a moment. .

He has recognized that voice; .

A wonderful diamond, said to have been obtained in Borneo,
as brought to England recently and delivered to the Minister of
,oiimelia for the purpose of having it set in the crown of the
j een of that country. The stone is almost perfect as it is, but a
ttle cutting will be necessary. It is understood that the com
‘act for‘ cutting the diamond has been given to our townsmen,
‘ . , .. . \, .
raigie & Sons. At first it was supposed that cutters either in
gndon or Amsterdam would be employed, but the stone was
'= ought to Edinboro‘ yesterday and is now at the warerooms of
‘raigie & Sons, on Prince's street. The diamond will be placed
"i exhibition there as soon as the work of cutting has been

What is the Rarest Stamp.

The question is hard to answer. Even pi'ofessio1ial
», stamp collectors disagree on that point. Among the
V rarest are the New Haven st-amps issued by that city
before the general government began issuing postage
'sitamps.i Tliey are valued at $2,500. The issue‘ of the
"Confederate States are rare and valuable, as are also

:‘

ii"'t»hose of Moldavia aiid the ﬁrst issue of the Hawaiian?

Islands. The issues of the cities of St.‘ Louis, Millbury,
'New Haven, Baltimore and Brattleboro are rare sand
worth from $100 to $1,500 eaeh, acco1'di1ig to the variety
and peculiarity of the dies from which they were printed.
