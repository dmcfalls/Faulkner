 walked upstairs and entered the first room he

 came, to. There was no one in it, so he took the

liberty of proceeding further. Entering’ a hall-

way he followed it ‘to a doorway. , ;Looki;ng

up which he took his way.’ There were many-

private. houses on the block, with ﬁat houses on

of ‘:9. street lamp a plethoric‘ looking wallet lying
011 ‘the sidewalk. ‘ T “
.‘f.I-Iellol” he exclaimed. “A. pocketbook, by
George!” i  ’ T * ' '
, ﬁe'stooped to pick it up. As he ‘did so two
‘men, who had been crouching behind the area
Wfence ‘opposite the spot, rushed upon him. Before
he knew what was about to happen one of the
men struck him with something heavy and he fell
on his face, knocked out. _' p ' ,

“A boy!” he ejaculated. “Stunned by a coup e“ _V
of footpads whose object was robbery, of course. 
But _they didn’t get away with his pocketbook ' 7
after all, for he has it in his hand.” :

He took, the wallet from the boy’s ﬁngers.

“Seems to’ be well ﬁlled,” he added,” as- he.
stuffed it into Bob’s pocket. “They missed-»._a" -'7

turning to the other gentleman who ‘had come up. =

The doctor, for. such he appeared ‘to be,,’éx-
amined Bob’s head carefully. : T _ “ . ‘

“His scalp is badly cut, but there, appears to.be
no fracture as far as I can ‘see. Had the blow

Bob was carried into the doctor’s office, the gas . . =

Bob’s head’ pained him a great deal, and he fell! 
Weak and dizzy. He. closed his eyes’ and made‘no' '

and concocted some kind of preparation which he. . ',f

discovered the fat wallet in his pocket where the
W 7;loctor’s friend had stuﬁe it. Ordinarily he
» ‘would have jumped at the conclusion that he had
7 niade a valuable ﬁnd, but after what had hap-
pened he was satiﬁed it was only the bait the
' * thugs had placed in his path‘ so as to take him
* off his guard while they rushed upon him. Qf
» eoiirse, he supposed their object was to‘ rob him
. tiff-whatever articles of value he had. on his per-
‘ son. He congratulated himself on the‘ fact that
V tlheir purpose had been defeated. _ _
:f5He opened the wallet, expecting to find it
stuffed’with trash, and apparentlyit was. When
‘ * he had removed two bunches of foldedpaper, cut
 from a newspa'p’er,:the wallet presented a lean
, andempty aspect. ’ _
' V l “Just as I supposed,” he muttered. “That seems,
, to_,»be a new trick’. to trap the unwary. At least
 Iineyerfheard of "it being worked before. It got
ﬁne-all right. Next time I see a wallet lying
‘around’ loose at night, if I ever do,1I’ll be rnore.
' cautious in grabbing for it.”, 4 _ ' "
r He casually looked finto the caps, of which there
were three, not expecting to find anything, but
1‘ one he“-«found a folded note.’ Openingxitcout

earlier period. . I N
For this purpose I purchased at an antiquary’
a stuffed snake of the same genus and species as  5
the one which had so aﬁrighted her, and one even-
ing when I was alone with her in the parlor, sud-
denly displayed it before her. ‘
The result was as I anticipated. She immedi- -
atelv was ‘seized with another ﬁt. V ' ’
The struggle which ensued was an exact coun',-
terpart of the previous one, my triumph, if .any-
thing, was a litt1e,'more diiﬁcult, as.‘she now ‘-’
looked upon me as an enemy, aridexerted all her 1
power to overcome’me. _ _‘  -
I will not dil te all the successive encounters ,3’, I
of mental and p ysical prowesswe engaged in;»
suﬂice to say that gradually I lost the ‘power of
bringing on an attack whenever I chose, and that
for some time they only occurred one a month,
and even these became less and less violent As
they did so the.memory of her ill-fated friend,
and the circumstances of the latters’ death, came  '1
,back to her. faintly at ﬁrst, as the ﬂeeting yisidn
of a long-forgotten past, but after a while with‘  ” 
more distinctness, until, one evening, I heard the ’
whole story from her own lim. , _ ' » ﬂ »'
. Then I suggested to her parents that she should" 
be brought to the grave where rested the »
mains of the unfortunate girl. _/
,_This was done, though not without some
'givings on thepart of all of us.

however, did not fall into" convulsions, * ‘-
