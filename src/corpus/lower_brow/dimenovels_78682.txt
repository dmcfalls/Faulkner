TTALIKA, THE GEISHA GIRL,

 l NICK CARTER’S JAPANESE RIVAL.

 

Edited by’ CHICKERIN G CARTER.

CHAPTER I.

‘ THE MYSTERY AT THE GEISHAJS HOUSE.

‘ Nick Carter was awakened in the middle of the fore-
‘~‘:l1j1oon by some one touching him on the forehead, and
he started up to ﬁnd that Tom Harnett was standing
; over him. A

The dletective was at the time in Tokio, Japan,

1»; where he had already passed a rnonthand a half, on
;.. business of importance for the Secretary of State of
if.’ the United States; but that business had been concluded
ﬂsafisfactorily, and Ten—Ichi, a former assistant to the
’:iV:Cl€‘lI.€ClZlV6 and a son of the mikado’s, whom the de#
 tective had found in Japan after a separation of more
?than two years, had been sent with Nicl<’s report to

Washington. The young prince, who was soon to be

,‘ publicly acknowledged as such, had also carried a per-
"SO/nal letter written in the emperor’s own hand to the
, President of the United States, in which was made
 clear all that the detective had asserted in his report.
to that, _
A ring’ ‘ '

    
 
   
 

"In effect, the result of the detective’s,n;issipn,
titty _was,Vor would soon be, to_-iestabl’

      

las

   

‘peace between the two nations; a peace that had long‘

been threatened by the jingoes of both countries.* .
The case had closed with an interview between the

‘detective and the mikado, at which Ten-Ichi was also

present, and at the end of it Ten-Ichi had gone to make
ready for his trip to the United States, while Nick,

worn out by the exertions of two successive nights, 4

had repaired to a room that the emperor insisted upon
his occupying in the palace, in his own private suite,
there to make up for the sleep he had lost, and to
obtain the rest of which he stood so greatly in need.

It had been near ﬁve in the morning when he got
into the bed that the emperor placed at his disposal, and
when he was awakened so suddenly it seemed to him
that he had ‘notlbeen sleeping more than ten minutes,
so soundly had he slumbered.

It should be said right here that in prosecuting the
case he had justconcluded, Nick had been greatly aided

by the man who now stood beside him, who-was an ‘

Englishman born in Japan, and who had never seen the

1..

;coun_1;r‘y. of his fathers; and also by a beautifullgeisha

;;;1f—-brie who was known among the Nipponese as the
‘uiyeerifofi the geishas—-named. Talika.

, Talika"had been known to the detective on a former
'i\'sit to the country, and he had readily accepted her
’ ; aid; but‘in making use of it he had incurred the jealous
rage of a certain general, one Maoki, who -had threat-
ened both" him and her, more than once, and who had
. once sought to have the detective assassinated in the
;_cstre‘ets of Tokio. _ . , _ , " ~ -
  When ‘Nick and Harnett had parted after the inci-
d_ents.of"the preceding night, the latter to his home,
[and the former to go to the mikado in company with
"Ten:-Ichi, almost the last thing that Harnett said to
‘Nick was that Talika would now be in serious danger
from Maoki; but later the emperor had promised

 

  

  

ingher.

 .‘Now,, as the detective started wi,de—awake and dis-
‘covered that it was Harnett who had aroused him, he
nstantly jumped to. the conclusion that it was on Tali-
ka-’s account that the man was there.

‘ ;In_this he was not mistaken, as we shall presently
H ';lis_c,ov_er." , . -

        
       
     
    
  

  

v _utiit was" astounding, also,'that Harriett should
.,.ha§_e been, permitted to penetrate the palace-room that
Nick was occupying, without having had announce-
"‘r;l1<_3i'1_t.of, his presence sent in ahead of him. I

to the ‘ﬂoor. “How in the world did you get

THE CRIME AGAINST TALIKA.

As soon as the detective was dressed he called one  V

of the servantswho had been assigned to attend upon

him, and gave him a note which he Wrote hastily, with V‘ .’ V

instructions that it be delivered to the emperor as soon
as he awakened, if he was not already astir.

Then he followed Harnett from the palace and they I
hastened together towa.rdr,that.section of the city where“

the house of the geisha girl was located.

There were several people on the street near thern;
as they were about to ascend the long ﬂight of steps, I. '

and Harnett caught him by the arm“‘and detained hini.

“Wait one moment,” he said, “until those people are , I I

itolenter the home of a. geisha at this time of. the"
day.” i  . i i -I
So they waited with what patience they could, until : .
the coast was clear, and then made the ascent of the

steps and entered the “house. i M
Nick Carter paused inside the door, having closed
it, and looked around him. ’ V ’

He could determine at once that Harnett had given '
a very clear account of what he had seen there; but

house of the geisha, and Nick saw that officers were

already in ‘possession of it. ‘He was very glad indeed
‘ .that hehad been permitted to make his own investiga-
Y . tions before things were disturbed there.

As’Harnett had prophesied, alrriost the first face they
saw when the charge was made against them was
Maoki’s, who leered in sullen fury at the detective

I asihe was brought forward to the desk and the charge
against him was made by the officer who made the
_ arrest.‘

“What have you to say?” Nick was asked at once.

“Not guilty,” he replied. '

.“Why were you at the house of the geisha, then?
You were seen to enter there; you are known to have
 remained there some time in company with this man',”‘

I pointing toward Harnett. « .
'"“I had been informed that a crime had‘ supposedly

.been committed at that house, and being a detective in i

‘K my own country, as wellas entertaining some friend-
 shipfor Talika, the geisha, I went thereto investigate.”
; ‘_“I,ndeed. Whogave you the information you speak

   There was some consternation in the face of the of-
 7 ﬁcial‘ at this statement; but plainly he did not believe it,
 “_f,or‘he smiled derisively, and Maoki was heard to laugh
 audibly. ’ ' -
 “The- murderer—.-if there be-one-—is the man who

CHAPTER IV.

THE ESCAPE OF THE REA)’; CRIMINAL.

What action the judge might have, taken then
will never be known, for to the surprise of all an
officer of the Palace Guards entered the room at that

. -moment. He was accompanied by two of his men and
_ Vtheithree strode up the center aisle until they were
, _ almost at the desk when the officer stopped and sa-
llutedz.
“By cominand of the mikado,” he said simply; and
-i-nstantlylevery person in that room who was seated
' rose to his feet, and then inclined their bodies for-
 wward almost as if in prayer. Even the judge on the
 bench was not exempt from this.

The officer continued;

if“,-ii‘ ;“It has been called to the "attention of the mikado
' Y .- that _an American gentleman who is now an honored
guest at the palace of his august majesty was seen
‘on the streets of the city a little while since, under

It was less than half an hour after that when N ‘

“What is this rumor that has reached me in regard“

 NEW NICK CARTER WEEKLY. ‘ I . is ’ T '9, 

“I will explain to your majesty that -in securing the

services of the geisha I had no thought of them. until

I was taken into her presence at her house two nights

ago and discovered that she wasione with whom Ten-

:.” Ichi had made me acquainted when- I had the good

fortune to serve your majesty before the commence-
ment of the war with Russia.”

The mikado inclined his head in assent.

“On that occasion she recognized me, although I
was in ,.disguise. General Maoki was among her
guests. We had some talk together, and when it was
time to depart the geisha requested me to remain. I
was told at the time that the fact would anger the
general, but I paid no attention to it. It resulted,‘
however, in an attempt to assassinate me.that same

 

I ‘ night, as I was returning to my hotel from the geisha’s I I

house.” *
“Yes.”
_ “It became my duty to present the geisha with a
;_bracelet the following evening; but during the day

I received a letter from her, telling me that General
, Maoki had threatened me with death if she clasped it
; .o on her arm or permitted me to do so. Mr. Harnett
 has seen and read the»letter.”

  
 
 

_“Very well. Please continue, Mr. Carter. I was
not aware of these details.”

V “I returned a letter to’Talika in which I told her
Qithat I would nevertheless present the bracelet, and
‘that I would also clasp iton her _a_rm——by force, if
necessary. Of course that was said only by way of
emphasis.”
“I understand.” .

V “I did present her with the bracelet; I did clasp it

‘v on her arm. When the guests were departing from
V; her house and Harnett and I were requested to remain,
I ,i,Giene‘ral Maoki remained also, and then in the presence
of both I-Iarnett and myself he insulted her.

. _“I seized -him and choked him into insensibility. I
"carried him to a rear room, asking Harnett and the

 

i ”  that adjoining room I removed his outer clothing and
put it on myself ; I also made my face up to represent
‘him; I drugged him so that he would sleep. ‘After
that, with the assistance. of Harnett, I conveyed Maoki
to my hotel and locked him in my room. He was un-
 conscious.” ' '
‘ “t‘Yes. Go on, please.” _ , A.
_ “Then, in company ‘with Harnett, I attended the

I represented General Maoki and made a speech in his
name. a " ' i '
“When we left the society, I returned at once to

my hotel _and set Maoki at liberty, after which I joined

Ten—Ichi, where, with Harnett, he was awaiting me,
and we came directly to your majesty’s presence.”

“All that is very clear indeed. And now it is your.
opinion ” ' , Q

“It is my opinion that Maoki, as ‘soon as I set him
free, descended upon the house of the geisha’ and stole.
her away. I do not believe he has murdered ‘her; I
believe that he has only made it appeariso, with the .
idea that he could charge me with the crime. I _
lieve that he has taken her somewhere a. captive, and A
that he is now holding her.” I

“And has not Maoki been arrested?”

“He escaped from the court-room, your majesty.”
I “And is at liberty?”

“Yes.” ,-

“Well, Mr. Carter, until you have settled up the V
mystery surrounding Talika I will not interfere with
your time and your occupations. I will direct the
premier at once to invest you with such authority-as .
you may require, and I sincerely hope that you may ,
discover that Talika has not been injured.” V '

“I thank your majesty.” ' , A I, _, ,

“In the meantime I have directed that your belong-I I‘ I
ings be brought from the hotel to the palace. You, I
will occupy the suite of rooms that adjoins Ten-Ichi"s,,
which I believe -are not unfamiliar to you.” A -

As soon as Nick and Harnett were outside on the V
streets of the city again, the detective said ‘to his ' '
friend: I . V

“I want you to take me now, at once, to your father-
in-law; to General Lakatira.” _  § *1

“Do you believe that he can help you ?” s I I _

tion about Maoki; some general information, I mean.:_

“Always.” _ ii _ {

“By the way, does General Lakatira know of the‘ dey  V

“No. Certainly not. No one knows about it but _
the mikado, Ten—Ichi, Talika, you, and I, and Maoki

“That while Maoki might himself have the 'hai'dI‘- ‘

“To that I will reply, general, that if among his
followers there is one who has committed some crime‘

for which his life is already forfeit, the fear of ext , 

posure and the threat that the would be exposed, would

' drive him to do Maoki’s bidding instantly, no matter

what it might be.” . ,

right. Moreover, I happen to know that Maoki has

soon be placed in his way to interfere withhis hope. 
of gaining access to Talika herself in her captivity. ’_ 
He knew that once she was inside that _rooVm”toli 
which’ she was about to be sent, there would be two 3
women there with her to guard her ir_iside,'and foul: V" i 1
men without, to stand, guard there. *  
, He realized that there would be little hope of 
being able to get past them,‘ at least, without arousing .
the entire establishment by the racket that would be
made in so doing. A_
Plainly there was only one course to be pursued.
While it wouldhave been his choice to'have,:r’e-
mained where he was until the others were gone, and
then to have fallen upon Maoki, he did not believe
it to be the best policy at the moment, ‘since it was
more than likely that the men in the establishment
would be aroused, and his whole plan might be putto
naught. . v - * ' p_
And so it was that before those inside the room had ~
started to leaveit, he had himself turned away"and‘. , i
started rapidly along the corridor toward thatawing . 
which Harnett had said was likely to be the one where, . A ‘
Talika would be imprisoned. ' .'
He had to take his chances as to that. ' A
There was the possibility of a mistake, butvtherle __
was no time in which.to investigate, and so he ran on, 

managing to make the turn into the south wing before 

Talika and her guard had come from the room where it i
the strange scenehad just ‘occurred. ‘
He ran to the end of that arm of the cross——to'the
T of it, in fact; and he discovered what he had hoped"
to ﬁnd, an open door at the extremity’ of it.‘ 1 *
Without an instant of hesitation he passed through
this doorway into the room beyond, which occupied , _
the whole T where it crossed the end of the arm of the. =" J‘:
‘house. 7 « i
A glance told, him
correctly. ' _
There were evidences enough to prove to him thali
itwas the room to which Talika had been taken when '
she was brought there, and therefore the one to which
she, was now being conducted. '  -- V ,

freedom bythat means.  - M ‘

With his great’ strength he was able frequently,._by
digging behind some .of the bricks, to pull entireisec-  7

began to fear that he mightiundermine the thing"
thoroughly that the whole upper part of the lchiiinney

After that there was a long period of silence duz-ing
which Nick Carter worked on ‘ike mad at the Cl‘lii1'l-

CHAPTER. X.
‘A FLIGHT THROUGH THE NIGHT.

There was a time of utter silence then that lasted
about ﬁfteen minutes, but it was followed by a resound-
ing crash against the door that made splinters ﬂy
from it, and Nick knew that it could not withstand
more than two or three such shocks as that without
giving way. i -

He turned from the chimney and leaped toward Ta-
Iika, taking the revolver from her ‘hand. "Then he
threw himself prone upon thewﬂoor and in that posi-
tion aimed ﬁrst at, one and then ‘at another of the
holes already madeiby bullets in the door.

And he ﬁredv three times in this way, being rather
gratiﬁed to hear each time a_ shout or a curse or a
groan to tell him that his bullets had found a mark’.

Then he thrust the pistol into her hand again and .

ran back to the chimney.
, 9 He had gained, as he discovered, another "short res-

They could hear groans" andthe sounds of talking
in the corridor; but now he was working at the bricks
with feverish haste, for he had not only reached at
 zllast the outside layer, but already two of them had
, i been knocked from their places, so that the cool night

‘: hair rushed in upon him. i r »

Already Talika was beside him, and he seized 
hand and pulled her with him into and through the“
dust—cloud just as the battering-ram came again against
the door and burst it from its fastenings.  ,

As it happened they alighted upon a deep,soft' bed
of ﬂowers, into ‘which Ni<:k’s feet sank hal-f-way"to*
his knees; and then they both pitched forward on the
faces. .

But the detective was up again instantly, ‘and, seizing

There was «no more talk after that. They needed
{all their breath for the exertions they were making.

  
 

Several times as they ran, Talika begged to be put.
down, insisting that she ‘could run with them even
though she did wear the chains and ropes of jewels.

people were doubtless outlaws and pirates who pi-eyed

“Well, anyhow, the ﬁre is the quicker of the two; 5
and we-might as well utilize the time ‘while our ene— -i
mies are quiet. Come‘on.” ‘
“What do you propose to do?” '
“Take to the vaults.” .
“May I make a suggestion?” asked Talika.
“Certainly,” replied Nick. L »
“Then you and Harnett go below'together and ,
search the vaults. Leave me here on guard. If you‘-i. I

hear my riﬂe, come to me; otherwise I will remain here
until you return for me.”

It was a daring thing for her to suggest, but it was-i ,
acceded to, and after another careful survey- around i
the house, Nick told I-Iarnett to lead the way-, and

' they went below.

The way into the vaults led through a sort of cellar
where‘ Harnett had some time before‘ that begun -to“
dig away part of the foundation‘ in order, to replace
it with better, and in so doing. had discovered the 
“vaults,” as he called them, ~ 

But- Nick Carter, as we know‘,‘had- had considerable-’
experience in such places, at one time and another,“
and he recognized instantly that he was inside manu~ __
factured caverns that were not only extensive, but that ' ‘
had. been excavated for a very deﬁnite purpose. I

And there could be but one deﬁnite purpose for", ’_
which such corridors would have been dug, he thought, ‘
particularly if the men who dug them were formerly/‘
pirates; and that purpose would have been, to make ‘
secret way to‘ the water, so that they could get to thei,

they ran.  V , s ‘
“Come,” he said. “Keep your riﬂes and follow
me.” . A
 They dived below, fastening securely the trap-

. they were in the cellar where they entered the passage-»

 Unfortunately there was no way to close that be- '

hind them, and Nick knew that it would not be lon_g

_ upon their riﬂes and the narrow passages to "be able
" tokeep the pursuers at a respectful distance.

as they moved along the opposite sideof the crater,
.and there were ﬁfty—two of them. Outside, before
they left the roof of the house, he had calculated that
1- at least a hundred were climbing the wall that‘ sur-
’, '_I'Ol11'1dCd it, and so now he had positive proof that they
,_ would have stood no chanceof resistance had they
«remained where they were.

 i The party made its way directly toward the gallery
through’ which the detective and his friends had‘ ap-

gpeared one by one into it until all was darkness around
‘ them again——and silence.

7 ' Still they waited a. time longer, to be sure that
theredwere no stragglers; and at last satisﬁed on that
«fpoint Nick pressed the light into service again, and
’;t’h_ey continued on their way. . .

- “These men will discover presently that we have es-
caped from the house,” he said, “and then they will
follow us. We must make haste.” '

But their course was now much easier. The gal-
lery they traversed. was higher and wider and smooth-
er, and they made their way rapidly along it.

And so, of a sudden, they came to a wall of roclé of

For a moment Harnett was appalled, but not so the _

He had seen such arrangements before, and pres-

It did not‘ take them long to remove that impedi-
ment, and, throwing the door open, they stepped out
upon a ledge of rock that overlooked a cove. that jutted
into, the land from the bay of Tokio. a .

l , Dawn was just at hand.

Directly beneath them, anchored a few rods from

shore, was one of those curiously rigged sailing craft

which are used along that coast, and drawn up on the p ,

shore near it was a small boat that evidently belonged ' i

to it. A
Before them was a path that led down to the shingle
along theshore. V '

They lost no time in “descending this path, Nick still i

her until he had placed her safely in the small boat and
had shoved it into the water. , V

The sailing craft they board‘ed—--its local name would
not interest you for you could not pronounce it; it had
the appearance of a bug-eye with lateen sails instead

of 1eg—o’-mutton——-was perhaps thirty feetrlong, anditv i

looked as though it could sail very swiftly.

The detective gave a quick order to Harnett, and
himself sprang to one of the sails. ‘
_ As soon as the two sails were raised Nick directed
Harnett to cast off the rope that was attached to the
anchor and throw it overboard; and then, seizingtlie

tiller, he brought the craft around so that the ‘wind

ﬁlled her sails, -and they darted swiftly away.
But they were not an instantttoo soon.

Even as they ﬁlled away, they heard shouts from the-

top of the ledge they had so lately left, and, looking *

back, they could see a swarm of men rush out
it from the cavern. — r * .

‘Instantly the detective seized Talika and forced bani

to lie, down in the bottom of the boat, orderingiHarnVet~,t

prone upon his back and reached up over  to grasp , d

 The “young scamp” did not wait to explain, but, hav-
