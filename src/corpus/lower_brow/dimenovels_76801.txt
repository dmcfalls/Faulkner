There hadbeen a pause after the caller’s last re-

marks. I . i

. "W ell,” he exclaimed then, "I‘m not coming more
than two—thirds of the way across the continent for
nothing. I set out to consult you, and I will do so."

“That's better," said the detective; and, willing to
help him tell his story, he asked: "What kind of a
case is it, Mr. Snell?” ’

;“I suppose you'd call it kidnaping; but there's rob-
bery combiued with it, and——and also-—also black-
mail.” ' V

Mr. Snell hesitated and stammered a little at the
end of this speech. '
V Nick merely nodded. _ 4 ‘

"‘To begin with.” continued Mr. Snell, “I come
from Wenonah. You may‘ not.be aware that the

a Government of England has made a large section
of V\’estern British America into a province and
called it Wenonah.” . V _ '

\‘‘Yes,’’ said Nick, “I am aware of am.”

“Yqu are a well-informed man. Few Americans
would know the fact, tor the province is so young
that it isn’t down onthc maps yet. You know.

“Y es‘, but nothing _ha_s,, come of it. There is
doubt now whether she is really  the hands of ‘kid-
napers.” '

“Ah! what then?"

“I haven’t told you the whole story, Mr. Carter."

‘TGo on, then.” '

“The day after she disappeared it was found that
a considerable amount of jewelry had gone also."

“Did she wear it at the ball ?”

“Some of it, most of it, in fact. But that was not
all. There were also missing certain state papers
and some private documents belonging to the,gov-
ernor. These are extremely important. They must
be recovered at any cost.” I ‘

“Are they more important than the recovery of
Miss Bradley, Mr. Snell ?' " ‘ ‘

“No, I wouldn't say that, but they complicate the
case badly. An offer has been made to restore
them.” 1

“And the girl?" .

“No. That is, there was one oﬁer to restore the

‘girl and another to deal for the return of the papers

and jewelry. There seems tobe a double gang of
villains at work.” '
“Possibly. \Vl1at aboutthe blackmail you men-
tioned ?”

with the stolen papers.”

“But,” interrupted Dick, coldly, “nobody has
dragged you that I am aware of. I certainly didn't.”

“You are trying to do so now, Mr. Carter.”

Nick arose.

“There is no need that we should talk longer," he
said. .

Snell also stood up, and he looked very much
troubled.

“I see that I have offended you,” he said. “I
didn’t mean to. You see, Mr. Carter, a great scan-
dal might come of this. It is very important that
there should be none. The governor's position
might be lost ”

“At this moment,” said Nick, “I care nothing for
the governor’s position. Yau have given me some
facts in a case that might be interesting, but I don’t
propose to tackle it unless’ I know what I am about."

“\Ve want you to look for the girl and the stolen
papers.”

. “\Vho are 'zt'e.”’
Snell hung his head.
“Excuse me a moment,” said Nick, then; “I think

I heard the telephone ring. —When I return I hope
you will have made up your mind to trust me. If
you haven’t we can’t do business." “

He bowed and left the room, but he did not go
to the telephone. _

Instead he went to a room where Patsy was read-
irig and gave him a few rapid instructions.

Then he wrote a telegram and sent it to the near-
est ofﬁce by a servant. '

Patsy got his hat and went downstairs.

“Now, Mr. Snell,” said Nick, when he ieturned,
“are you ready’ to tell me what I want to know?"

“I can only say that I want you to act in behalf of
the governor)’ .

“Does he know that
ask this E”? V

, Snell did not answer. .
“We are wasting each other‘s time,” said Nick.
Snell made a last appeal. ' I

' his first business was with Snell.

 This was not only because Nick had sent him out
to shadow Snell, but because the ‘man seemed to
be badly injured. I .

‘ He was groaningand trembling so that he would
have fallen if the detective had not held him up.

“Better sit. down a,rninute,” Patsy suggested, .“and
let me see if there’; anything serious the matter.”

Snell sank to a doorstep, and Patsy made a quick
e amination of his head.

"if-.f‘That was a nasty blow," he said, “but I think your

“I don’t think he will try it again; at least, not in
New York. I’d rather not talk about it."

“Just as you say. sir. Want to stop in at a drug
store and get your head bathed with arnica ?"

“That would be a good idea."

They entered the next drug store they came to,
where it proved that Snell had suffered nothing
more than a painful bruise.

After that they went on to the Fifth Avenue
Hotel.

"I am very much obliged to you,” said Snell, halt-
ing in the doorway-

“Don't mention it,” Patsy responded.

"Will you come in and have something?"

He looked as if he hoped Patsy would say no, but
the detective was glad of any excuse to stick to
him. A ‘

“Yes,” said Patsy, “don’t care if I do.”

Snell nodded silently, and led the way into the
hotel.

As they were passing the desk the clerk spoke to
him. \

“Mr. Snell,” he said, “there's a telegram here for
you.” _ 8
“Excuse me,” said Snell to Patsy, going qu'bckly to
the desk.

He. took the envelope handed to him, and opened
it with trembling ﬁngers.

When he had read the message he crumpled the
paper in his hand and frowned. '

After‘a moment of thought, he turned to Patsy,
said, “Excuse me”-again. and went with him to the
barroom.

Patsy asked for a glass of beer,-but Snell poured
himself a stiﬁ drink of whisky. '

“What a chance," thought Patsy, “to sneak up ;'._Hl
pitch his man overboard!"

The stranger stood motionless a moment.

Then he edged forward.

At that Patsy quietly opened the door and stepped
out.

The man did not hear him.

His attention was too much taken with what he
was going to do.

Snell was motionless.

The boat was about in midstream.

Patsy's muscles quivered as the stranger glided
swiftly up and placed his hand on Snell's shoulder.

Snell whirled around, with a gasp of surprise and
alarm. ‘ .
He put up his hands to push the man away, and
‘tried to back from the rail.
"-The stranger kept his hand ﬁrmly on Snell's
shoulder.
For a second or two the men jostled each other,
but it could not be said that they were struggling.
The stranger seemed merely trying‘ to hold Sn,c’:l
still.
Patsy heard him say:
.“Keep quiet! I _am not going to hurt you !”V
Evidently Snell was somewhat relieved at this.
but he was still frightened.

satisiy them. So I'll get a room somewhere else,
and then drop in here when I feel like it.

“That will be safe enough, for it looks sure that
Snell is bound to stay for a while.”

As the detective left the saloon, he saw a sign in
the window of a house opposite:

ROOMS TO LET.

“That will do,” he decided, “but not just yet.”

He was fearful that Snell might be watching him.
for he could not tell how suspicions that strange man
might be.

So he walked around town a little while. made :1
complete change in his disguise, and ﬁnally returned
to the lodging-house opposite Bronco Bill's.

There he hired a room that had a window opening
on the street, at which he sat for some time, with his
face hidden behind the curtain. ,

He saw enough to know that Snell was stiliat the
“hotel,” and he was satisﬁed.

Late in the afternoon, Snell went out.

_ The detective followed,‘ of course.

At first Snell did not seem to have any errand. He
seemed to he walkins; for exercise.

But at last he stopped and looked in at a store win-
do\v.

Riﬂes, revolvers and all sorts of things that hunters
need were displayed there.

Snell went in, and Patsy. looking in at the wind-:w_
saw him buy a revolver. _ '

Patsy, quietly. j

“Wow! ouch! damn!” howled Bloody Sam. as W5

Patsy’s bullet had struck it on the butt.

Patsy’s shot did for him just what had been done
for Bloody Sam.

It knocked thegun out of his hand and caused him
to leap back, cursing with rage.
’ “If you gents enjoy dancing,” said.Patsy, coolly.
“just recollect that I’m ﬂoor manager here. I’ll tell
you when it’s your turn—-—yours, for instance."

With this he let drive at the feet of a man near the
edge of the crowd. .

The bullets splintered the floor at the man's toe.

He jumped for iair, and the detective laughed.

“It's more fun than I thought," he cried; “we'll,

try it again.”

He made as if he would empty all his cartridges at
the men’s feet, but he had done enough.

All except Bloody Sam were making a wild scram-
ble to get behind the bar, out of doors, underneath
tables——any old place. so as to be out of range.

Sam had cooled down very‘ suddenly.

“Hold on, stranger." he called; "we uns know
when we’re licked. You've done us brown, an’ ei
thar’s anything in the house you want. call for it.”

Patsy understood the man.

His tone and manner showed that he meant what
he said. —

He was rubbing his sore hand and kicking his re-
volvers so that they would lie where he could pick
them up. i

Of all the men there Sam was the only one who
hadn’t shown fear. A "

The detective immediately pocketed his‘ weapon.

“All right, pard,” he said. good-naturedly; “there
is one thing in the house I want."-

“Name it."

“I want every man jack of you to wet up. The
drinks are (in me, gents. Step lively."

For an instant nobo‘dy stirred.

They looked at him as if they could not believe
their ears. ‘S ‘‘

Those who had crouched ‘behind the bar grad-
ually began to poke their heads above it.

Natui-ally, Bloody Sam was the first to move.

Leaving his revolvers where they were on the
floor, he strode to Eatsy with his hand outstretched.

“Put it there, pard,” he cried; “you’re a white man

an’ no mistake. 'I'see I don’t_need to ’pologize fer '

“He wants to walk for exercise,” thought the wait-
ing detective, “but he doesn’t dare to get far away.
for he’s eicpecting somebody. I won't bother to iol~
low him.”

So Snell that morning took his walks alone.

They were not long ones.

He was always back at Bronco Bill’s within ten
minutes from the time he started.

At length he went in and stayed there.

Patsy went across and looked in long enough to
see that Snell had found an old book somewhere, and
was reading it in the barroom.

It was almost noon when the man Snell had been
expecting came.

The detective knew it before Snell did.

Watching from his window. he saw a man come
rapidly up. from the direction of the railroad. 7

He walked as if he knew where he was going, and i
he turned in at Bronco Bill's.

It was the stranger who had come so near to mur-
dering‘ Snell 2-. short time before in New York city.

“Now we're getting down to business!” thought
Patsy, with great satisfaction. -

It had been a long wait, and he was a little tired
of it. ' , ’

Every day he had sent a telegram to Nick, saying,
simply, “No change," or, ‘.‘Nothing doing.”

Meantime, he hadreceiyed no word from his chiej.

V So he knew that there was nothing for him to do
but stay there and watch.

Of course, he crossed over to the saloon soon after

' the stranger went in. ‘

He was disguised sothat neither knew him, and
Bronco Bill did not suspect that the man who asked
for no cigar was the one who had done the wonderful
shooting the night before, ~ . _

_ as t , the detective had bought a horse. v
M V The animal was stabled a few doors from his lodg-
e ing-house, where he could be got quickly, and he was
kept saddled all the time.

But there was no use for him on this trip.

The men walked through the city, and they acted
as if they were in a hurry, but they walked, and Patsy
thought it better. to follow them in the same way.

A. As long as they were in busy streets he had no dif-
ficulty in keeping close to them.

When they came to a long street, where the houses
were, scat_tered,_he fell a little further behind.

NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

He waited a bit, and listened for sound of their
voices, or footsteps, but heard nothing.

The hill dipped steeply on the other side, and there
were many hills beyond. " »
, It was a very wild place, only partlyiwooded, and
there seemed to be deep gullies in every direction.

“They didn't come out here for their health,”
thought Patsy. “It was to meet somebody.

“Probably thattsomebody is waiting. in one of
these gullies. V

“Which one’?

“lt’s almost as good a place for hiding as a big
city is."

After some little thought he went part way down’
the hill, then along the side until he came near the
edge of a ravine.

While he was cautiously approaching the edge, he

heard a laugh somewhere below him.

In the ravine, undoubtedly.

Then that was where the men. had gone.

Patsy saw a rock a short distance away,‘ from be-
hind which he thought he might be- able to look
down into the ravine without being seen.

A few cautious steps and he was beside it,

Leaning far over it, he found that he had chosen
the spot luckily; for-a little way below  he saw a,
group of men, most of them roughly dressed,

1011. _
They were talking earnestly.
At that moment, Snell's companion was speaking,

and the others were listening. .
His words came faintly to Patsy’s ears.

"Among them were_ Snell and his strange eompan‘. ,

down to the gulch.

It was the way these men always took to ge

But, unluckily for the detective, they had
sentinels at that spot. _ , «

His captors had been within reach of him from the
moment when he arrived.

Why they had not attacked him at once could only
be guessed.

Probably they were so surprised that they didn't
know what to do at first. .

And maybe they thought he might be a pros-
pector, or- anybody but a detective, who would go
away as soon as he had taken a look.

"\Val, by gosh !" muttered one who seemed to be
the leader of the sentinels. "I reckon this'll make
some difference with what they're jawin’ about down
that.”

Patsy tried a bluff. .

“I’d like to know what you mean,” he began, in-
dignantly. "I haven't done anything to you "

“And we won't do a thing to you,” interrupted the
leader, l1arsh1y—-"oh. no! we won't tech yel. Pick
him up, boys." .

Two of the men took Patsy on their shoulders, and
they went stumbling down the side of the gulch.

Snell and the others looked up in the greatest sur-
prise when they heard the sentinels coming.

All the men got to their feet, for some had been
sitting. and guns were shown freely.

"What the devil ye got thar P” demanded the
chief of the gang. ‘

“A spy,” replied the leader of the sentinels.

“Find him up that ?”

‘‘Yes—--behind'that rock. He crep’ up jest as cf he
knowed that was suthin’ to see below.” ‘

“Dad rot him!" ‘

"‘Proh’ly,” went on the sentinel, “he was put onto
theething by them galoots,” and he pointed to Snell
and his companion.

“That’s it l” roared more than one, angrily.

“So this is" what ye call bein’ on the square, is it ?”
exclaimed the chief, turning to Snell's‘ companion”

“Certainly; when you deliver the goods."

It was Snell who responded, and his voice was
calm now.

He seemed to feel that his victory was won.

Leonard, on the other hand. looked worried.

“Guess that’s right enough, then,” remarked the
leader. "We've got the goods, an‘ we’ll show thet

He interrupted himself suddenly, with a glance
at Patsy. ‘

“ 'Twon't do,” he added, in a decided tone; “not
jest yet. We don't want no witnesses to this per-
ceedin'. I don’t perfess to say,thet this geezer’s a

bored holes in him out thar in the hills.”

“Good God !” exclaimed Harry, “you wouldn’t do

They heard.

Patsy saw young H3"'§"5

Others proceéded promptly to obey the leader.

thought the detective.

He could make no resistaiice, and tried none.

' It was useless, too, to bluff the men or try to plead
with them. '

They gtuffed his own handkerchief in his mouth
and t_ied.a cord tightly around his ankles.

“He’s got nerve,” said another, noticing that no

The close cellar was filling rapidly with the poison-
ous stull.

Patsy’s throat tickled.

He coughed and partly dislodged his gag, but it
was only to take more gas into his lungs. ‘ '

\Vith all his might he wriggled so that the cord
might be cut or worn enough to break. '

He ‘could make no effect on it, so far as he could
tell. i '

Every strain simply made the cord cut deeper into
his ﬂesh, and he was as helpless as before.

The poisoned atmosphere choked him.

He felt his head whirling.

The whole house seemed to be going around and
around. .

In the confusion of his mind he seemed to hear
voices in a loud discussion.

They ceased-—‘there was no sound—-—except a fear-
ful roaring as if he lay at the bottom of Niagara
Falls.

And then, a dreadful feeling that he might as well
give it all up.

A man had todie some time.

One time was probably as good as another.

He had done what Nick told him to as well as he
knew how. ,

He hoped that Nick‘ and Chick would somehow
get at this gang. ‘

Patsy was very tired and sleepy. . .

The whirling and the noises ceased. His brain
was at rest. ’ -

there is to it.’

“I thought of your telegram, Nick. but said noth-

where the papers were kept, and so forth, I inquired
if he had any suspicious.

“The question seemed to make him uneasy.

“ ‘I cannot suspect anybody,’ he replied.

“I remembered you, Nick, and I said:

“ ‘That means that you suspect everybody.’ ”

.“What did he say. tothat ?” asked Nick.

“Huh! he smiled in a que'er way, and simply said:
‘W'ell3’ Of course, I pressed him to be frank with
me, but didn't succeed at ﬁrst.

The grip was sent for later, the man said, and was
taken to a street that he named. '
Nick went to that street.
He walked the length of it twice.

There was no good hotel on it, but several board-'

ing~houses, and any number of saloons.

Among others was Bronco Bill's.

Nick looked at it each time he passed.

It was not the first one he entered, but, after drop-
ping in at two or three other places, he entered
Bronco Bill's place just as the proprietor was telling
a customer about a shooting scrap that had taken
place there recently.

“They wanted to make the tenderfoot dance,” said
Bill, grinning. "but durn me cf he didn’t make them
dance and holler more he got through with them.
Such shootin' I never (lid see! I thought "twould
be the last of Bronco Bill's house. but the young
stranger just brought them crazy galloots to their
senses in no time‘. Say! he hit a dime-—"

And Bill went on to‘ tell the whole story.

- “Patsy !" said Nick to himself. as he slowly put
down a glass of beer at the other end of the bar. ’ “I
wonder how long it will take Dinsmore to follow his
trail to this joint?"

Nick sat down to wait, and had supper meantime.

Shortly after nine o'clock, Dinsmore came in,
looking sour and hopeless. _

“Ah! there you are," said he. "I’\_'e been looking
for you."

. "Why didn't you come here, then?" askéd Nick.

"Because I didn't expect to find you here. I
seemed to trace a man who looked like the governor
to this hole _gsevcr_al times. Plenty said they’d seen
such a rnan hanging around. but the governor
\%ouldn‘t put up in such a place. not he!”

“It's where he put up, justthe same,” said Nick.

“Who told you ?" p _ 4
“I guessed it. My assistant has been here, and he

wouldn't hang around in such a place, either, unless-

thcre was business in it.  business that brought

“It's the fellow they called Harry !” said Patsy to
himself, sitting up now and carefully lifting the body
away. “What the mischief does it all mean?”

His memory was returning fast.

He recalled now how he had been carried down to
this cellar to be suffocated with gas.

That was early last night.

It was now day, as he could tell from the light at
one dusty window.

Besides, the cellar door was open, the one opening
into the passage through which he had been taken.

His hands had been bound so hard that he could
not loose them, and now they were free!

“How did that hap-——"

He looked at the cord that had been around his
wrists. '

It was cut through.

Nothing could be clearer than that smooth mark
of a sharp knife.

The detective looked at the knife in Harry’s dead L

hand. _

“That's it!" he said, softly. “The poor fellow
tried to save me. and he came pretty near doing it.”

He tried to take the knife from Harry’s hand,
but the stiffened ﬁngers held it tight.

His own knife was in his pocket, and with that he
cut the cord around his ankles.

Then he got up.

His head still swam, and he was weak, but his
strength 'came back rapidly.

- Going. to the wall, he found the gas jet.

The cock had been turned squareioﬂ‘.

‘THarry did it,” he whispered. “Poor fellow! I
remember how he ‘couldn’t" stand the idea of my be-
ing murdered. His coming in and leaving the door
open ventilated therplace, and so'I didn’t die of suf-
focation: “Poor chap!-he meant well. I wonder how
he came to be shot?”

Shot ‘lie’ was, as. the detective could see from the
wound in the yo£mg‘man“s breast.

 339gV:hough,*the'op§i1- knife, the ‘cut 3

still missing, to say nothing of the great rar
that had been paid down.

So Nick went with the governor to Manch .-r,
and there found Patsy, Miss Estelle, and all thﬁ the
governor had been looking for.

It  supposed that one of the gang hid the papers
and the money in the box under the stairs during the
confusion of the attempt to escape.

“It was a clever move,”  Nick, discussing it;
“for the rascal must have known that some, if not
all the gang, would be captured; and it would be fool-
ish to have ﬁre stuﬁ captured with them. So he took
the chance of hiding it, meaning to go back some
time, next day probably, and get it.” -

Governor Bradley oﬁered to pay Nick and Patsy
for their services. ,

“I don't think we want any pay,” replied Nick.
“We’ve had a good time out of it, and we weren’t
engaged on the matter at all. But I’d like to ask
two favors.”

“They shall be granted,” said the governor.

“First, then, when you have detective work to do
in the future, don't try to do it yourself.” r

“That’s easy,” laughed the governor ; “you may be

“The second,” said Nick, “is that you consent to
the marriage of your daughter and Cecil West. He’s
a ﬁne young man ” ,

“I yield,” interrupted Governor Bradley. “I will
sendzfior West at once.”

He kept his word, and the young people were mar-
ried not long afterward.

Nick and Patsy meant to return at once to New
York, but they were detained in the West for a time
longer by another case, which brought them against

You should have seen what a state of mind she and
mother were in. They did nothing but buy new clothes
and sew, and talk about the wedding all day long. Sue
was determined to be married in church, and to have six
bridesmaids and six -bridegrooxns, and ﬂowers and
music, and all sorts of things. The only. thing that
‘troubled her was making up her ‘mi cl whom to invite.

Long Ben.
(By Geo. Rothennell, Pa.)

Up in Vermont, there was an old man, a maple sugar
boiler and shipper. He had three sons, one of whom
was of an extraordinary height. This one was Benja~
min, commonly called "Long Ben." He was not tall
for his years as a boy, hence an explanation was neces-
sary why Ben was so tall.

This was hi; father's explanation:

“I always made my sons take their turn at watching
the sugar boil at night. Wall, one night (it was my son
Ben’s turn to watch) this remarkable thing happened:
My son Ben was a lazy boy, and always went to sleep,
instead of watching the sugar. Wall, this particular
night the little chump stole about I dozen eggs from the
hen house. it was his intention to slam the eggs into
the lesses and after the eggs was boilt to eat them.

“Wall, the eggs was boilt, and he wuz about to eat
them. He heard footsteps and not wantin’ to be dis-
kivered with the eggs, he got up and got right intoone
of them there lasses barrels. As I sed afore, Ben he
wut a lazy kid; and what do you think he did? Why,
he fell asleep in thet there barrel. Wall, early in t
rnornin’ one of the men, he heads up the barrels, th
goes back to his nap. _ t

colts grazing right nee: the barrel. Wall, he watches
his chance, and whenthet there can come: pat the bar-

Badly Mistaken.
(By Ernest Shorsett,‘ Tex).

A well-known citizen of New York. occupied a seat
near the door of a crowded cable car when a masterful
stout woman entered.

Havin no newspaper behind which to hide, he was
ﬁxed an subjugat by her glittering eye. He rose and
oﬁered ‘his place to her. Seating herself-«without thank-

to the farthest end of the car:
‘ “Say, what do you want to stand up there for? Come

some pie. Mike did slip. .He fell the length of the stairs,
and ended his trip of gravitation by landiugon the wash
boiler. V. '

The next thing that troubled the night air was the
bellow of the,1a.udlady.

“Who is that?" screeched she.

“Mee-e-oo ow,” was Mike's only reply.

This satisﬁed the landlady, Mike had some pie and
retreated back to his bed, after stubbing his toe. The
agility with which Mike got in bed caused Pat's equili-
brium- to be disturbed. Of course, Mike had to explain
the reason of his absence. Mike added to his explana-
tiouz

“Pat, if youse run up aginst anyt’iug, remember youse
is a cat."

Pat proceeded on his disastrous journey. It may be
added that the only thing big about him were his feet.
He fell over the clothes basket at the top of the stairs,
but was saved from falling by the number of cubic
inches his feet took up. He succeeded in reaching the
pie ﬂoor without causing any anxiety in the front room.
He reached the cupboard, and was in such readiness to
have some pie that instead of picking up the plate on
which the ie was situated, he grabbed the pic's circum-
ference which was composed of crust. Of course, afresh-
baked pie could not stand this tremendous strain. The
outcome of this niistalre .in geometrical sequence was
that the plate was attracted by Pat's feet; the outcome
of whioh was a hideous yell. V

“Who's that,” was bellowed again. i

»Pat was on the verge of telling her to mind her busi-

“ i ness when‘ Mike's warning dawned on his top piece.

Where Nick was lassoed by the man in the automobile
and dragged along the pavement.

There I paused.

“I'll see if I can't put two and two together,’ I said

to myself, and I started in to try to do it.

The people who attacked Nick Carter must have had
some object, I thought. What could be their object? '
Nick was well known as a detective. Their object
must have been to prevent him from bringing some
criminals to justice. They must be the criminals them-
selves, or the friends or employees of the criminals.
That was the way I reasoned.
The fact that the assault occurred in front of the
