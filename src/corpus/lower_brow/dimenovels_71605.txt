CHAPTER I.—Eddie Nott, the New Broker.

“Who's the new broker?" asked Jack McGuire,
a popular member of the New York Stock Ex-
change of a brother member. as the two men
paused in fmntIof_a door on the fourth ﬂoor of
the Barnum Building, No. —- Wall Street, one
morning, and stood watching the dextrous ﬁngers
of a sign painter as he was lettering the frosted
glass with the following legend:

EDDIE NOTI‘.

"You've got me,” replied his friend. “Never
heard of the man.”

“Somebody from out of town, I guess, who

has come to -New York to do us up at our own

game,‘ ned McGuire.

“And e’i1 do it, tool Oh, yes; of course Jie
will! I see visions of it. I hope he has brought
a fat wad with him.” , . ,

‘Why?’ ,

“Because I should like the pleasure of helpinz
Um let rid of some of it.”

“There's nothtnﬁ mean about you, Robinson.’

'‘That’s right, eGuii-e. I'm always ready to
take an newcomer by the hand and show him the

IOPQI.
"I'd hate to have you show me the ropes, Robin-
aon; upon in soul I would.”
‘Why so ‘laughed his friend. '
‘ “Because you'd surely lead me into some trap
and get legal possession of my little bank ac-
count.”
,‘‘Isn’t that a rather tough accusation to make

I . against a friend?’

“It would be anywhere-oiitsidekof Wall Street,"
iIplied‘McGuire. - _
‘i'he two men walked away, laughing heartily.

' They were hard! out of sighttbefore a bri ht-

Eddie Nott unlocked the door, and the two en-

one, the. upper half on which was ground glass.

which Eddie intended to use as his private oﬂioe;
and the other, which was locked, eonnectin with
the ethos of a neighboring tenant named udley

on s. .
‘_‘ h, I forgogﬂsaid Eddie. “I want you to
paint the word ‘ vats’ on that inner room."

“All right, sir; I'll do that in a moment."

While the sign ‘fainter was putting the word
on the ‘door he to! Eddie of the short conversa-
tion he had overheard between the pair of in-
quisitive broken who had stopped to look at the
slim and to wonder who the new broker was.

“I wish I knew who they were.’ reﬂied the boy.

“I can tell ou their names. One addressed the
other as~M uire, while he called his friend Rob-‘

inson."

“Thanks. I'll. remember them. _No doubt I'll
hear from them before, long. I think they both

I didn't know that my old boss, Mr. Smooth, had 7

any connection with it. I went in to the limit,
and was lucky enough to sell out before the crash
came which soaked Mr. Smooth in the solar plexus
to the tune of a cool hundred thousand. I cleared
$10,000, and Smooth heard about it. He was as
mad as a hornet over his own loss, and it was
like rubbing it in for ,a beardless clerk of his to
come out ahead of him on the same deal. So
he read me the riot act, and I quit.”

“And now you've started in business for your-
self, and actually hired the olﬁce adjoining him.
You've got a nerve.”

“I've got a lot of them, if anybody shouhl ask

Bob grinned, pulled a cigarette from his vest

pocket, and lit it.

“Is that your last cigarette?"

“No. Want one?"

“No, sires! But I want to inform you if you
expect to work for me you must draw the line

Smooth cut Eddie off his pay-roll, for the reason
ii in the previous chapter.

Then Eddie concluded that he had worked long
enough for a salary and determined to vary the
monotony of it by becoming his own boss. He
lived with his widowed mother and a small sister
in a cozy ﬂat in the upper section of Manhattan
Island, and had largely supported the little house-
hold during the last three years. Having de-
termined to start in for himself, he had the nerve
to’hire the two small vacant oﬂices adjoining his
late employer. He didn't know what eﬁ‘ect this
would have on Mr. Dudley Smooth, but he did
not much care, as he did not consider it was any
of Mr. Smooth's business. He-started in, and
furnished the offices, and was now ready for any
business that might come his way.

Eddie had given Bob Hawkins a duplicate l_<eY
to the oﬁce, and when he got down next morning
at half-past nine he found Bob seated by «the
window in the outer room waiting for something
to do. The new broker went'into his private
office, and taking up the morning's copy of the
Wall Street Indicator, for which. ‘he had sub-
scribed, and which Bob had placed upon his desk.
began to study. the quotations of the previous
days’ business on the New York Stock Exchange.
He might have been engaged half ‘an hour in
this manner when Bob rapped at his door, and
on being told to coni_e in, popped in his head, “and
said there were two gentlemen in the outer oﬂice
who wanted to see him.

‘Show them in here,” replied Eddie, without

“You carry matches, though you don’t indulge
in a weed,” remarked Robinson.

“Sure. 'I'hey’re handy to have around some-
times—when I want to touch 05 the electric bulb,
for instance.”

Both of the brokers laughed at this sally.

“Might I ask where you are from?” asked Rob-
inson, blowing a cloud of smoke.

“Cei-tainly—I hail from good old New York,"
replied Eddie. _

“The deuce you do,” replied Robinson. “I had
an idea you were from Chicago, or Boston, or
perhaps Philadelphia.” '

“No, sir. I have lived on this island ever since
I was a little boy."

“Then I suppose you have been employed in the
Street for some time," went on Robinson.
“Strange I do not remember your face.’

“I've been in the Barnum Building for four
years," said Eddie.

“The dickens you have. McGuire and myself
only moved in here a week ago. McGuire’: oﬁlce
is right across the corridor from mine, around
the turn.”

“I was sure you were both new tenants or I
should have recognized you myself. I was em-
ployed by Dudley Smooth, who occupies the ad-
Joining suite, uiitila few days ago, when I start-
ed in for myself."

_“0h, I-see,” replied Robinson, with a shade of
disappointment on his face.

He began to suspect there was nothing in Eddie
Nott. That the boy had little capital, and was
probably working solely on his nerve.

“I guess we'll have to be going," said Robin-
son, rising and looking at his friend as much
as to say there was nothing doing in this locality.

“Don't be in a hurry, gentlemen,’ said Eddie
genially. , _

“Oh, we only dropped in for a moment. I've ‘
got to get over to the Exchange. As for McGuire,
I believe he has an important engagement.”

“Well, come in again when you have the time,"
said Eddie. “Pleased to see you any time.”

Eddie laughed after they had departed. ~

“Robinson was disappointed," he grinned.‘ “He
‘came in here for some purpose, that's evident. No
doubt he was going to angle for some of my
ﬂeece. but has come to the conclusion that I’:

CHAPTER III.—Eddie Goes Into Kentucky
— ' Central.

Eddie found that McGuire was in. The im-
portant engagement Robinson had referred to
was a mere ﬁction on that broker's part. The
boy broker told McGuire the object of his call.

. “Sure,-it will give me the greatest pleasure in
the world to allow you a part of my commission
on this or any other deal you may favor me
with, Nott,” said McGuire, heartily. “You're just
starting out, and I'll be glad to help you all I
can” ‘

“Thank you, Mr. _McGuire. I shan’t forget it."
“Don't mention it. Just endorse that check,
and I'll buy 165 shares of P. W;’& C.. and hold it
subject to your order. You can then notify your
customer of the transaction in the .usual way.
' ~ When you _your instructions to close out the
deal we. wil divide up the con_imission."‘
Eddie thanked him, and then broker hand-
ed him aememorandum of the ansaction. The
‘young.-broker returned to his ofﬁce, entered his
first order up. inhis book in regular shape, made
out~a statement. and mailed it to his customer._
‘, Just then Bob made his appearance, and said

gallery of the Stock Exchange to see how things
were stirring on the ﬂoor. Matters _were rather
quiet, so he.didn’t stay long. On his way back
to his office he stepped in at the safe deposit.
vaults where he kept his money to get a paper
he wanted. ‘

While waiting‘ for a chance to get to his box
he overheard a couple of well-dressed gentlemen
talking about a certain stock. They did not seem
to notice his presence, probably on account of his
youthful appearance, and went on talking just
Eddie couldn't very well
help hearing all they said, though he did not
appear to be listening to them. He soon learned
that the name of this stock was Kentucky Cen-
tral, and that a combination of capitalists had
been formed to buy as much of it in ,at the low
price then prevailing as they could, and then
manipulate the market so that the stock would
soar thirt or more points, when they expected to
dispose 0 their holdings at a big proﬁt. , - A

One of the gentlemen mentioned the names of
several operators who were interested in the‘
scheme whom Eddie recognized as millionaires,‘ ,
and wound up by advising his-friend -to take ‘
advantage _of this chance to make a good haul,
assuring him that he.couldn't lose if he didn't
hold on too long after the stock got well up in
the market. The conversation camelto an end
‘when one of the gentlemen was admitted to the
vaults, and while waiting his ‘turn Eddie did a
good bit_of rapid thinking. '

“This is a tip! can't aﬂord to get,by me,’ he
mused. * “When I see a chance to get in on
the ground ﬂoor;-'of"a deal I'm there with both
feet. 1'11 Just yank my little $15,000-out or the ‘

I box and soak it into Kentucky Central right"

away, before the syndicate gobbles up all the
stock in sight.” . .

So as soon as he_got access to his box hg _
out his entire capital; which was in big. Q;
and hastened back to his oﬂice. The ﬁr-st thing '
he did was to look up Kentucky Central, and he» ‘
found it was ruling at 49, and referring to 1 
transactions of the stock noticed it had not
higher than 53 in a month. ' * \

letter to Carry Thornton. _

“What’s that!” he roared, when his oﬂice boy
delivered his message. . _

"Eddie Nott is outside, and wants to see you.
repeated Tommy. ..

_ “I won’t see him. Tell him to get out and stay
out," howled Mr. Smooth, loud enough to be heard
all over. the place.

Of course Eddie heard him, and chuckled at
the old man's anger.

“Tell him I want to buy a thousand shares of
a certain stock, and that I’ve_got the mone_\' in
my clothes to pay for it," said he to the ofiicc
boy when the lad came back to inform him what

. Mr. Smooth had said. _

Tommy hardly relished the idea of going back
to the private office, but ﬁnally consented to do
no. -

‘Wants to buy stock, does he?" bawled Smooth-

ricking up his ears when he heard there was
cosine’ as in the wind. .As the old man never under
any circumstances neglected a chance to scoop _an
honest dollar, he told Tommy to send Eddie in.

he entered, and Eddie said:

He counted-out ten $500 bills, and laid them '

» you?"

“Thank you, I will, Mr. Nott,” she replied, with
a smile. -

“Oh, come now, call me Eddie, as you always
did. I ain’t a hit proud, although I have gone
into business for myself.”

Carrie laughed.

“I'm glad to see you getting ahead. Mr.—I
mean Eddie—and I hope you will be very success-
ful as a broker." '

“Thank you, Carrie.
I don't." ,

“I'm sure it won't," she returned sweetly.
“You're the smarest boy I ever met.”

The entrance of Mr. Smooth at this interesting
stage cut short further conversation. The old
broker regarded them with some suspicion as he
handed Eddie his change.

“When you want to buy some more stock, young

man, I shall be pleased to have you drop in,” he
said, trying to look pleasant.
’ “I’ll keep your invitation in mind, Mr. Smooth.
I hope you'll get used to having me so close to
you. I'll endeavor not to gobble up all the busi-
ness that ﬂoats into this corridor."

The old broker smiled a crafty smile, and
snapped his knuckle joints. In his heart he be-

It won't be my fault if

lieved the new broker's career would be exceed-'

ingly brief. Eddie, having ﬁnished his business,
nodded to Carrie, and’ took his leave.

In a day or two Kentucky Central began to
advance and Eddie purchased 1,500 more shares.

The P. W. & C. shares he purchased for Grant"

also advanced. In the course of a couple of days
the shares of both stock had advanced to such a
ﬁgure that Eddie sold out, making a line haul
for himself and also enriching Mr. Grant. .

CHAPTER IV.-—-Broker Robinson Asks Eddie To
Go It Blind With Him. .

A few mornings after Eddie’s coup in Ken-
tucky Central there came a timid knock on the
outside door. Bob went to ‘the door and opened
it. A very pretty and stylishly-dressed young
lady of perhaps twenty-two stood outside.

“ls Mr. Nott in?" she-inquired.

“Yes, miss.
you want to see him. What name shall I say?”

“Miss Grant.’

Bob. knocked-g on the private door.

1‘Come in," said the boy broker.

“A lady to see you. I_Ier name is Miss Grant.’

“Show her in," replied Eddie, wondering if

she had any connection with Mr. Grant of Com-

wall.

The young lady walked into the new broker’:
sanctum.

“Mr. _Nott,”_ she asked doubtfully, as she took
the chair Eddieypointed at. ~

‘‘_Yes, that is my name. What can I do for

“Then, Miss Grant,” said Eddie, with one of
his winning smiles, “I must congratulate you, for
of course you know by. this time that the market
did go the right way. Acting on your father’s
instructions, which I received iiva second letter,
I held on topthe stock till it reached 70 5-8, and
then sold it out. Your proﬁt was $1,650, which,
together with your margin of $1,000, makes me
indebted to you to the extent of $2,650. Shall
I hand you the money!" _

“No, no,” she re lied hastily. “I wish you to
it for me on your own judg-
ment." 1

“I hardly like to take an order in that way.
Miss Grant. I would certainly do the very best
I could for you, but I could not guarantee that
my judgment would prevent you from losing your
money. I made an unfortunate deal it would
be rather embarrassing for me to have to write

‘I am sure I can trust you fully, Mr. Nott.
You lodk very young, it is true," she added, with
a little smile, but‘you must be very smart, for
I saw a paragraph in the Chronicle which stated
that you had cleared something like 3100.000 in
tucky Central a few‘ days ago, and you could
not do that unless Eon were uncommonly shrewd."
“I am much ob_ged to you, Miss Gram}. for
your excellent opinion," replied Eddie, laughingly.

A MINT OF MONEY

“It is an equal pleasure on my part to have
met so charming a customer," said Eddie, gallant-
ly. “And I will certainly take more interest in
the fate of your money now, that I know you
personally."

. The young broker escorted her to the outer
door, and bade her good-by.

“She's a peach, isn't she?” grinned Bob.

“She is 9. very pretty and interesting young
lady,” admitted Eddie, “and -I am glad that she
Isa customer of mine." ' ‘

At this point the door opened and Broker Rob-
inson entered.

“Hello, Nott,” he said, striking Eddie familiarly
on the back; “who was that handsome young lady
who just left your oﬁice?”

“A customer of mine,” replied the boy, coolly.

“She's a stunner. Sorry I didn't come in soon-
er; then you could have introduced me."

Eddie didn’t say anything. He thought Mr.
Robinson had a good deal.of cheek to suggest
such a thing.

“What can I do fdr you, Mr. Robinson?" he
asked in a business-like way.

“I Just dropped in~to see if I could induce you
to pool issues with me in a little venture I have

in view. ~
“What stock is it?" .

_ “Excuse me, Nott. That is hardly afair ques-
tion. You ‘haven't said yet whether you will join
me or not.” . .

“How can you expect me to agree to join you
unless you te 1 me what you have in the wind?"

_“But then you'd know as much as I do. You
might refuse to go in, and» then make .use of the
pointer on your own book."

“Well, Mr. Robinson, if you can't trust nae I-

I’I1 hear from him, too, before long, as soon as
he hatches up some scheme to try and get at my

I knew it would, to have_ to draw that big check
for me. He was so sure at the start that my
margin would remain right in his office that his
disappointment was simply heartbreaking to
him."
Eddie got his second customer that afternoon.

,- A respectable looking old gentleman walked

into his office about one o'clock and asked for
Mr. Nott.

“He's out at lunch," said Bob, wondering who

' the visitor was.

“Will he be back soon?"-
"I couldn't say, sir. He may be back in a few
minutes, or he may stop in at the Exchange.”

“May I use your desk a moment,” asked the
old gentleman.

“Sure you can. Sit right down.”
—~ The yisitor wrote an oﬁler directing Eddie to
purchase 10,000 shares of Nashville Jr Memphis
at -95, and have the same delivered C. O. D. at his
oﬂice before noon next clay, if possible. A

“I_ need scarcely sa ',” he added, “that this or-

f‘Hand this to Mr. Nott when he comes in," lie
said to Bob,‘ and immediately took his leave.

He hadn't been ne morethan five minutes

wonder who my good friend is?"

Eddie ﬁnished the note. _

“I'll go out and try to get some of that stock
right away. I haven't anything better to do.”

He put on his hat and started to make a tour
of the broken’ otlices on the Street. He succeed-
ed in purchasing 6,000 shares in small lots here
and there, and he got hold of another thousand
from the Broad street curb brokers. Then he
werﬁt into the Empire Building, but couldn't ﬁnd

“I ought to be able to get the'other 3,000 in the
morning,” he said to himself as he headed back

When he reached the fourth ﬂoor of the Bar-
num Building he decided to run in and see if Mr.
McGuire had any. He found that this young
broker had gone home.

"I’ll twomnson, just for fun, but I don't be-
lieve he any.”

“Mr. Robinson is engaged,” said the small oﬂice
boy who sat in the reception-room. “He will
probably be able to see you in a few minutes.”

“I'll wait a short time,’ replied Eddie, stepping
ovelr to the open window which looked out on a

As he stood thereinhaling the air_ he plainly
heard llr. Robinson talking in his private room.

of disgust. “Said that he didn't fancy a blind

that. He makes me sick. The Exchange ought
to start a kindergarten for embryo brokers like

‘1I’ve got $60,000, you know, and I can easily
raise another 315,000. You must get $5,000 more
somehow if you're goin in with me. The stock
is selling now at 90, an will surely go above 110
as soon as the boom sets in, which it is liable to
do in a couple of days. That would give us money
enough to buy 17,000 shares on margin, out of
which we ought to clear over $150,000 apiece in a
wee ."

“That would be a ﬁne haul," said Robinson..

“I should remark. If you can’t raise the money
by to-morrow, why, we'll haveto go in independ-
ently. I'll buy the stock to the limit of my capi-
tal, and you can do the same. With $30,000 you'll
be able to get 3,000 shares, anyway, on which you
ought to make $60,000." -

“You are certain that your information is re-
'liable'!" -

“Positively. I got it straight from my brother-
in-law, who is one of the directors of the road.
The company has bought out the P. A. & N.,
which has been a thorn in its side for six years.
As soon as the news gets out, which it will by
Monday, ou'll_ see something doing on the Ex-
change. ere is a lot of the stock ﬂoating around
the treet,‘ and the

ready begun to buy t in as fast as they can. So,
you_ see, we have no time to lose. I shall begin
buying at noon to-marrow for myself, if not for
our joint account.”

“All right, Benson,’ said Broker Robinson. “I'll
see what I can do toward getting enough money
to match you by to-moi-row noon, an will let

_ youknow by eleven o'clock. I'm afraid, however.
that I won’t be able to make the rifle."

“Then don’t’fail to go in on your own hook."

“l’ll do that, you may gain le on it. I'm not
letting such a chance as this get away from me.’

That ended their conversation, every word of
which Eddie had head. He was new full alive to
the intended_treacher_y of Mr. Robinson toward
himself, and it didn’t improve his feelings toward
that gentleman. .

Soon Eddie was ushered into Robinson's olllea.
Asked what he could do for him, Eddie said he
was after Nashville & Memphis. But Robinson
told him he hadn't a single share, so Eddie :9.
turned to blsoﬂlce. By noon he had secured
all of the stock wanted by Mr. Whitney, and it
wasﬁdelivss-ed to that gentleman.

‘that is, if I am not imposing on your good na-

Eddie was willing to keep her on his list on

‘own terms and that after-noon—~he sent her a
‘draft for the $200. ,

As he was coming back to his oﬁ'i_ce from a

“That doesn't surprise me, either. It makes

“He was very angry over the way in which you
came out ahead in Kentucky Central.”

“I have no doubt he was. He looked it the next
time I saw him.”

. “Then the other day you made $15,000 on T. I.

“Well,” said Eddie, very much interested, “did

‘you ought to be an easy proposition, as you had
had so little experience as a broker.”

CHAPTER VII.—The Boston & Maine Shares.

Next, morning there was some excitement on
the Exchange over the sudden rise of a certain
stock, and Eddie left his otllce to go to the 
ors’ gallery to see what was on the tapis. He
hadn't been gone over a minute or two before a
sandy—featured man walked into the .office and
asked Bob if Mr. Nott was in.
“No, sir. He just went over to the Exchange.”
“Well, that's too bad. I wanted to see him
about sellino some stock for me,” said the visitor,
taking a big envelope out of his pocket. “I was
told by a friend that Mr. Nott was one of the
smartest young brokers on the Street, and so I
thought I'd call in and see him. You don't know
when he'll be in, do you?"
“I don't expect him to return for half an hour
at least. Can't I take your order?" .

- _ _f'I'm afraid not,’ replied the ssndyman, in a
doubtful -tone. “I have some shares here which
_I want Mr. Nott to sell for me," and the speaker

Bob the contentsof the envelope."
"Then on had better call in an hour, sir. If

“It will be impossible for me to call again to-

“If you will give me your name I'll take it in
to him," said Bob.

“It isn't necessary," replied the visitor glibly.
“Mr. Nott doesn’t’know me. I just want to see
him on a little business."

Bo went into the private oﬁce and told Eddie
that a gentleman who wouldn't give his name
wanted to see him on business. ‘

“All right. Tell him to step in.” -.

When his caller appeared his face seemed a’

triﬂe familiar to the boy.

“I've seen him somewhere," thought Eddie, “but
I can't place him at this moment."

“Mr. Nott?" asked the stranger.

“Yes, sir. Takes seat. Your name is "

“Benson,” replied his visitor.

Instantly Eddie recalled under what circum-
stances he had met, this man, before. He was

Robinson's friend. The man to whom Robinson ‘

had explained the trick he had hoped to work 08
on Eddie, ‘and who had furnished the tip which
had resulted rather disastrously both to himsdf

and Robinson, but had proved a $90,000 

to the boy broker. Eddie had only wot a gl'
of his face as he was leaving Robinson's

but he now knew it was the same man. The fact‘

that Benson was an avowed "friend of Robinson's
-. put Eddie on his guard.

“What can I do for you, Mr. Benson?” he asked ,

said Benson, rising, with a disappointed loo_k.
“Very well, You will «probably find me in all

Mr. Benson then took his leave. After he had
gone Eddie began to ponder_ over the situation.
“This Boston 62 Maine business begins to look
rather funny to me. What induced Robinsons

think I'll go in and consult McGuire about this
matter. He's a decent man, and no particular

McGuire, however, was at the Ercchanxﬁ ind
Eddie couldn't see him just then. Finally he de-
dded to submit the thing to the broker with
whom he did business. So he called on Mr. G1_b-
Oﬂn, the head of the ﬁrm. That gentleman lis-

of the fourth day Eddie was surprised to receive
a visit from Robinson, who was accompanied by

“Well, Mr. Robinson, to what am I indebted

“No, sir," answered Eddie promptly.

The man, who proved to be a detective‘, showed
his authority from a magistrate to search Eddie's
office for certain speciﬁed certiﬁcates of Boston
& Maine stock.

“You are looking for that stock. are you?"
asked Eddie.

The detective nodded.

“You may save yourself both time and trouble
by applying at the Old Slip police station for
those shares."

“What do you mean?" demanded Robinson,
ﬂushing red in the face.

“I mean that those shares were left at this
oﬁice by a stranger to be sold. He promised to

“That won't do now, Mr. Robinson,” retorted
Eddie, who saw that he had his enemy on the
run. "You have practically charged me with

“I'll apologize,” interrupted Robinson hastily.
V “Sit right down at my desk, then, and write a
retraction of your supicions/I demanded Eddie.

“I'd like to see myself doing such-a thing as
that," snorted Robinson angrily. 4

“All right. Then I'll have you and Dudley
Smooth arrested for conspiracy to ruin me.”

“What do you mean?” gasped Robinson, turn-
ing fairly livid.

“Just what I say,” replied Eddie coolly.

“Are you out of your senses?" .

“Don't you worry about that. I have evidence
that you went to Mr. Smooth’s office and ar-

' ranged this Boston & Maine scheme in his private‘

room. ,You sent that sandy-featured man to my

scription of the fellow in the report of the cap-
tain of the Old Slip station. I shall get a mo".
complete one by having that broker’s oﬁice boy
questioned.” '

The chief’s wordsthrew Robinson into 3 mild
panic, for the sandy featured man was a friend5
of his own friend Benson; and he was sure that
if the man was identiﬁed and arrested that he
would give the whole game away to save himself.
The stock was the property of Mr. Smooth, and
was worth $61,000, and Robinson was anxious to
get it back so as to return it to him. He tried
his best to. persuade the chief to give’ it up, but
he wouldn’t, so when he left headquarters he hur-

ried to his office and telephoned to Benson to call '

on him at once.

“You must get Carter to leave the city at
once,” he said, as soon as Benson appeared.

“Why so?" asked his friend in surprise.

“Because he is in-danger of arrest at any mo-
ment, and you know it will be very awkward all
round if he is pulled in.”

Robinson then told Benson how badl ‘the os-
ton & Maine scheme had failed of accoymplislﬁing
its object. ’

“The'worst of it all is that the police have
possession of the-stock.‘ The chief refuses to give
it up until after he has investigated the case, and
his first move he told me will be to try and arrest
the man w'ho left the stock at Nott’s oﬂlce. That
is Carter, You know. He has a partial, and ex.
pects to get a more complete. description of him
from Nott’_s office boy. Now, it won't do at ‘in
for Carter to be arrested. He must be sent out .
of town until this thing blowsover. I'll see that
all his expenses are paid, so' I wish you’d attend

to the matter right away.” ' _ y _
“All right,",replied Benson, appreciating the’ '

hole Robinson was in. A _

CHAPTER IX.—Eddie Arranges to Take a Life
Partner.

Three months passed away, and the hot month
of August had the city in its grasp. Things hat!
:1 pretty slow in the Street since the first 01
July, and Eddie, although he had secured a couple
of dozen new customers, mostly_through his card
in the ﬁnancial journals, hadn't done any business

to speak of. He spent‘ a good part of his time_

with Carrie Thornton at the nearby seaside re-
sorts, and the two enjoyed themselves immensely
- together. The young broker wrote Miss Grant
that he had not so far seen anything that he
cared to risk her money in, but when he did she
,W0nld hear from him. This letter brought a
renewed expression of conﬁdence from the Corn-
wall young lady, and she promised not to be im-
patient as to results.
2 The police having failed after ‘a reasonable
- time in ﬁnding any trace of the sandy featured
man, let the case go by default, and returned the
_ltock to Robinson, who duly turned it over to
Ir. Smooth. The two rascals, however, had
learned a lesson, and were very wary of coming
“P against the shrewd boy broker again. One
"morning Eddie heard two brokers talking to-
Cether in low tones about a certain stock, the
V name of which they did not mention. They ap-
' to be members of a syndicate which had
11 formed to boom it.

“Smooth is with us in this, and will do the buy-‘

hug and booming," said one. “He will be assisted
, by a man named Robinson, and also by Benson,
_ ‘another smart young broker. We are certain to
make a good thing out of this deal all around.”
I ‘lwhen do we begin operations?" asked the

‘ _«; other.

“Next Monday. Nobody will suspect that any-
thing is in the wind until we have gobbled up all
’ the sharesin sight. Then, after we've forced up

. .tlie price, we'll commence to unload in a quiet

' . 5 way, and take our proﬁts." .

,_ At, this point the speaker-_obsei-ved Eddie close
by, and nudging his companion, they both walked
away. .

’ “ ," mused Eddie. “Smooth is in the syndi-
7‘ cate, is he? And he, Robinson, and Benson are
" . going to do the booming and buying‘! I must get
' ‘oi; the ground floor, too. .I'WI8h I knew the

100 of Miss Grant's money, and went in to see
McGuire.

“I want you to buy me 1,000 shares of Southern
Texas for a lady customer at 61, which is the
ruling ﬁgure," he said to the broker.

“Faith, it will give me great pleasure to do
that for you, Eddie,” McGuire replied “for busi-
ness is plaguey dull. So the lady wants 1,000
shares, does she? Quite a plunger in her little
way. ’ '

“Oh,~she knows a good thing when she sees
it,” grinned the boy.

“Then you wish me to understand that South-
ern Texas is a good thing?”

“I think it is."

“Are you buying any yourself on the outside?"

“Well, yes; I have bought a few shares, just
to keep abreast of the times."

“It’s too bad that you never favor me with any
of your personal orders."

“Well, you see  have a special arrangement
with a big house up in the Street, otherwise I’d
send my orders to you," was the way Eddie
placated McGuire. ‘

An hour afterward Southern Texas had gone
un a point. Eddie got $62,000 more from his box,
went to another brokerage ﬁrm, and bought 10.-
000 additional shares of the stock. when the boy
went to lunch at one o’clock he found that South-
ern Texas was ruling at 64, an advance of three
points since the Exchange opened. After some
deliberation he resolved to go the whole hog on
the stock, so.he drew $64,000 from his box, leav-
ing a meagre $3,000 in the vault, and put it up
with a‘ third_broker as security- for another 10,000
shares, making 30,000 shares in all that he held
of Southern Texas. Evidently Eddie Nott was 9
boy of nerve.

“If .a screw should happen to work loose in

That afternoon Eddie wrote Miss Grant that he
had placed $6,100 of her money in 1,000 shares of
Southern Texas, and that she might look to see
it rise. He waited around till Carrie left Smooth's
oﬂice. and walked with her to the bridge cars.

they turned into Nassau street.

A MINT OF MONEY’

That day Southern Texas climbed up to 75.

‘I told you last night.that S. '1‘. would be
worth more to-day," he said to Carrie, when she
met him as usual at four o'clock.

“Yes, it closed at 75. That makes you worth
ever so much more, doesn't it?"

‘On paper I have made $180,000 to-day."

" 3-our proﬁts up to last night were 32,-
000,000‘! ,

"That's correct."

‘ﬂy goodness! What a lot of money!
wish you'd sell out to-morrow."

Eddie shook his head. _ _

‘Too soon. I heard Mr. Smooth say this mom-

that it was sure to go to 95."

‘I don't see how you manage to find out so

“That's m\' business, Mr. Robinson. You
bought the stock from Pyle, Hastings &'Co., one
of my brokers." .

“One of your brokers,‘ sneered Robinson. “One
would think you were a big operator.”

“Well, I'm big enough to have another 10,000
shares of Southern Texas in my vest pocket
which I'm going to sell right away. Do you want
them, or shall I have ’em dumped inside?"

Smooth and Robinson looked at each other
aghast. ,

“Have you really got 10,000 shares of Southern
Texas in your control?” asked the old man, with
s drooping lip.

“I have. Do you want ’em, or don't you? You
don't haveto take ‘em.’ .

“I'll take them at 89,” said Smooth, looking at
the boy as though he would have enjoyed nothing
better than to hear of his sudden death. “Give
me an order on your broker—that will be sulﬁ-
cient.”

Eddie drew a note-book and pencil from his
pocket. and wrote an order on the brokers from
whom he had purchased his last batch of stock,
to sell out his holdings at once to Mr. Smooth
at 89. The old man took it and hurried back in-
side of the Exchange. A representative of the
ﬁrm was on the door, and to him Smooth pre-
sented the order. It was promptly accepted,.and
the syndicate became the owner of another 10,000
shares, which it had not to have to
handle. As soon as Eddie found that his stock
had been transferred to the clique. he wrote a
little note. and sent it in to Mr. Smooth. This is
what it said:

“I have 10,000 more shares of Southern Texas
that I have no use for. You can have them at
90. If you don't take them in five minutes I'll

Robinson fairly gritted his teeth with rage. To
think of that boy being in on that deal and get-
ting the best of them in such a high-handed way!
He felt at the moment as if he could have mur-
dered the young broker. Accidently looking up
at the visitors’ gallery there he beheld Eddie
grinning down on them both with evident satis-
faction. ~

“Blame him! Blame him!” gritted Robinson
through his clenched teeth.

Then he shook his fist at the boy, who smiled
back in return and lifted his hat with the utmost
politeness. But he and Smooth to save them-
selves from ruin bought and paid for Eddie's
10,000 shares of the stock. When the Exchange
closed, Southe Texas had gone up to 93, and
Smooth, Robinson, and Benson were unloading
the stock in small lots to prevent suspicion of
their real movements coming to general notice.
Next morning they continued operations on a lit-
tle larger scale, as everybody seemed‘ crazy to
get hold of the shares, and they were beginning
to recover their former’ good humor when the
news of their plans got about the ﬂoor. A wild
panic ensued, the stock dropping ten points in as
many minutes.

Eddie. however, was not there to see it. He
was up in his oﬂice ﬁguring up the proﬁts repre-
sented by the statements and checks e had. just
received He had cleared $830,000 on the South-

“Well, if you're smart enough to do that I'll
give you my check for $10,000,” replied Robin-

SOD.

“I'll hold you to your word, Robinson,” said
Benson, “for I'm going .to do my best to win
your money.”

“But it must be understood that the bet is oil’
unless Nott makes use of the tip after he gets
hold of it,” said Robinson, hastily. “Otherwise
it would do us no good."'

“Of course,” replied Benson, and soon after.
ward the three brokers separated.

While this three-cornered interview was pro.
gressing, Eddie was in his office reading a. note
he had received _,from ‘Miss Grant of Cornwall,
She was simply in ecstasles over her extraordin.
ary winnings in Southern Texas, and said shes.
could scarcel believe her wonderful luck.

“I am coming to the city in a day or two, and

_ will call and see you, my best of friends,” she
concluded.

A few days later she walked into Eddie's ofﬁce,
dressed like a little queen, and looking altogether
as pretty as a picture. Broker Nott was very
glad to see her. and they spent a very pleasant
half hour together in his private oﬂice. .

.“Don’t you want some of your mone_\'?” Eddie
asked her.

“How much is it you owe me?”

“How much? Why, $34,000.”

“I never thought I should be worth so much,
she said,» ursing up her pretty lips. “Do you
think I he better risk it again in the market?’

“Well, Miss Grant, much as I should prefer to
keep such a pretty young lady a yourself on
my books, especially as you're first customer,
I frankly say that a bird in t e hand is worth
two in the bush." ‘ . '
. “Then you advise me to get out of Wall Street!’ '

,“You can leave the $4,000 with me for rain-
vestment, if you wish to go on, but I certainly
advise you to take the 830,000 with you and in-
vest it in real estate, or something more stable
than a game of chance.” ,

“Ve well. I will act on your advice, Hr.

what was in it. Both questions were answered
when he opened the package. ‘MISS Grant had
sent it, and it contained a magniﬁcent gold watch
and chain, and a diamond-studded charm, the
whole being easily worth $1,000. The donor
hoped Eddie would accept her present as a very
slight token of her esteem for him, and her grati-
tude for what he had done for her in a business
way. - The boy was delighted with this expression
of his original customer's good-will. .

“I have someth' ﬁne to show you, Carrie,”
he said to his swe theart that afternoon, when
she came into his oﬂice after working hours.

“I hope you won’t be jealous when I tell you
that I got that from a very pretty young lady-—
my first customer.”

“Is she really pretty?" asked Carrie.

“Wén, say, you just ask Bob. He thinks she’s

“It’e a wonder, then, that you didn't pick her
out for yourself instead of taking litt_le plain m_e."

“Little plain ,you!" laughed E_ddie,_ grabbing

kept mighty secret. Usually some hint of such
a deal being in progress gets out even if it is
denied by the interested parties. I must look this
thing up. /I may have got hold of a very valuab.e
pointer.”
Accordingly Eddie put on his hat and went out
to see what he could find out about the deal in
question. Necessarily he had to prosecute his
inquiries in a very cautious manner, so as not to
give the snap away if it really was a snap. He
made application for information at the offices
of both the Financial Chronicle and Poor’s Rail-
road Manual, but at neither place had they heard
the slightest hint upon the subject. Then he
went around to Moody's railroad publishing house, »
but they were as much in the dark as the others.
He then carried on his quest in other quarters,
but nobody had heard anything about a possible
change of management in the P. E. & N. road.
He investigated the condition of the road, and
found it was something of a rival to the C. & N.
W. Evidently it would be greatly to the ad-
vantage of the latter road if it could gobble up
the P. E. & N., but as far as Eddie could as-
certain there seemed to be no real reason why
the P. E. & N. should sell out to the other line.
“If this is a real tip I've got hold of I'll feel
like kicking myself around the block if I don't
ue it and it turns up trumps. I must consider
it,.well before I turn ‘it down.”
Eddie had heretofore done so well with tips
that almost without recognizing the fact his
weak point was the exploitation of a, tip. .
v_ery possession of a pointer set his blood to
tingling and the s eculative fever coursﬁig
throug his veins at ever heat. But still some-
thing_ told him to be wary about inonkeying with
a pointer that came over the ‘phone in such a
strange manner. I i
Next morning, soon after he came downtown, ‘
a man entered his oﬂice, and asked to seehim.
“What name shall I say?” asked Bob.~
“Stewart.” _ ‘
So Bob knocked at the door of the private
room, andannounced that a Mr. Stewart wanted
to see Mr. Nott on business. '
‘(Ask him ‘in: wall: in,” ‘said Eddie, and the
visitor en rm! his sanct . ‘

' and took his leave. The younger broker then
called ‘on Mr. Smooth and paid him cash for the
shares. 'When he returned to his office he saw a
card on the ﬂoor which he picked up. It had
some writing on the back of it. Eddie found
that it ran as follows: '

“Dear Stewart: Buy every share of C. & N.
W. you can aﬂ’ord. I have good reason to believe
that it will go soaring in less than a week.-

‘ ust then 'Bob- knocked at the door and said
Mr. Smooth wanted to see him.
~ “Tell him to step in here," said Eddie.
Mr. Smooth, looking unusually genial for him,
walked ‘ into the boy's sanctum and sat down
‘ beside his desk. '_

business."

“Well, you, I and Benson will figure this mat~
ter out later on this afternoon. I must get back
to my office now so as to complete the deal.”

‘When Eddie returned with $95,000 in his pocket
he found Mr. Smooth waiting for him. like a
spider in his den for an unsuspecting ﬂy. The
boy paid over the money, and got his memoran-
dum of the transaction. The first act of the
drama had been successfully played by the con-
snirators, and Eddie was unaware that he was
enacting the role of an innocent lamb.

CHAPTER XIII.-—'I'he Best-Laid Schemes Oft Go
Astray. -

Two days later C. & N.‘ W. had advanced a
point, and Eddie commenced to congratulate him-
self on his good luck. I ‘

“I've a great mind to buy another 10,000 shares,
if I can- get them. That will double my proﬁts
when the times comes to unload. Yes, I'll do that.

I'll get the money when I go to lunch." .

An hour later he sent Bob on an errand to
the Em ire Building. Bob was away an un- ’
usually ong time, and when he returned he was
much excited. . '

“What's the matter, Bob?

This was startling news for Eddie. But fore-
warned is forearmed. He thanked Bob for the
interest he had shown in his affairs, and then

ceded to consider how he should save the
95,000 he had put up with Smooth -the previous
§fte&noon as margin on the 10,000 shares of C. &

“Now that I am'on to the game I can get
out with a whole skin and a little to the good
by going right in to Smooth and ordering him
to ‘close out the deal at the one-point advance
the stock has already made in the market. Or
I can force him to go out and bu the shares
for immediate delivery. I have t e necessary
$855,000 to pay for them. That would treat
him to an unpleasant surprise, for I don't think
he has any idea I have so much ready money.
Come to thiiﬂt of the matter, I don't see how they
can force the‘pi-ice down unless they have or
can get control of ‘the stock, and that would take
a lot of money. It is possible these rascals are

“Listen, young man, and I will put you wise

and that the slight advance of one point since
Tuesday is one of the inevitable results of the
tightening of the stock. This syndicate has prac-
tically got hold of nearly all the shares that have
been ﬂoating about the street. You couldn't go

When Mr. Smooth read the note he nearly faint-

it to him. Robinson uttered an oath.

“Here’s the cash, Mr. Smooth," he said,.coolly.
“Now cough up that stock."

But Mr. Smooth could not produce the full ten
thousand shares, only ﬁve thousand, and he had
to admit his inability to keep his contract.

“Well,” replied Eddie,.“what are you going to
do about it? I'm prepared to pay for the stock. ,,
I’ve got $855,000 right here in hard money.” _

“I've bee'n trying to get that stock ever since
I got your note,” began the old man in an humble
manner for him. “But the most I could get was
5,000 shares." ' _

“All right,” replied Eddie, “there is nothing
mean about me. I’ll give you till three to-morrow ,
to wet the balance.”

Smooth drew a breath of relief. Surely he
would be able to get it by then. He found that
he wasn't the only man trying to get the stock
next day, and unsuccessfully at that, and to his
abject misery the price ‘of C. & N. W. rose
steadily‘ to 110. He returned to‘.his oﬁice and
sent for Eddie. . ,

“I can’t get the balance of this stock. I’ll de-

-liver half, and pay you the present market figure

on the balance.” _
That would have meant a loss of about $100,000 »

to the conspirators, but Eddie wouldn't have ‘it.

He ﬁnally agreed to settle for $350,000, when
C.'& N. W. reached 125, and Smooth gwas ouly,_‘~ 
too glad to accept the boy's terms.‘ Ag  _
the old man he paid, him over that, n- ,

CHAPTER V.—(Continued).

“I think you will like him. He is just about
your own age and set-up," answered the captain,
and Rob was then shown to a comfortable state-
room by the steward.

At a quarter to ten a taxi ‘came down the
wharf, from which Mr. Terrence assisted Miss

Edith Morley, a little black-eyed beauty of per- .

haps twenty-three or -four.
“My, but she's peach!" Captain Tucker said to
Bob. ‘‘I confess’ didn't relish the idea of car-
rying a lady passenger, but as’I happen to be un-
der obligations to Mr. Terrence, I could not re-
fuse. .

A moment later Rob was shaking ‘hands with

‘ Miss Morley.

“I am leaving Edith in your charge, Randall,"
said Mr. Terrence. “Do the best you can for her,
anudi you will have earned my everlasting grat-
t e." .

“Now don't you and aunt go to worrying about
me,"" laughed the girl. "I am perfectly able to

_take care of myself. Mr. Randall, you will ﬁnd
your ta a sinecure. I have crossed the ocean
a dozen mes.” ' '

«And now came the question: Where was young
Douglas? At ten o'clock, the sailin hour, he had
not appeared, but a few minutes ater a second
taxi came tearing down the gier.

“Here he is!" exclaimed aptain Tucker, as a
tall, blond young man jumped out with a‘ dress-
suiteasa in each hand. ,

Ten minutes later the Sterling Castle was
steaming down the East River.

Rob , ound Walter Douglas an exceedingly
pleasant fellow, while. as for Miss Morl , he was
attracted by her as he never before. ha -been by

any girl. . _
‘She's a stunner,_-’' remarked D las that night-

“I-Iow——if it's a fair question?"

“'I‘hrough_ certain letters I have.”‘

“I doubt if they can help you.”

“We shall see,” replied Rob, and there the con-
versation ended.

Day dawned clear and cool.

Rob found Edith ahead of him on deck. despite
the fact that he was up by six, leaving Douglas
_sound asleep.

“So you are one of the early birds, Mr. Ran-
dall?” she said, pleasantly.

“Always,” replied Rob, adding:

“But see here. I'm going to ask a. favor of
you. I a nmot used to being called mister. I've
always been Rob to every one.”

“And you want to be the same to me. Very
well, it shall be so on one condition."

“Which is?"

“That you call me Edith; like yourself, every-
body calls me by my first name.”

fectly fascinated with the girl. It was impossible
to feel bashful in her presence.‘

As the days passed and their acquaintance
fipeiied, Rob began to wonder if he was falling in
ove. .

“There must be no nonsense of that sort,” he
told himself,_ and he resolved to be strictly on his
guard, but Just the same he could not but con-
gratulate himself that Douglas, with whom he
had now become very familiar, did not seem dis-
posed to pay Edith special attention, and one
night in the stateroom he remarked u on it. ‘

“Oh, I'm leaving that for you, Re ,” laughed
Walter. “Wouldn’t be a square deal for me to
butt in." . I‘

“I donlt mean that at'all,” replied Rob. red-
deniiig; “only that you seem to avoid her, and
I know she feels it.” '

“I'll” ﬁx that,” was the careless reply. ‘“Of
course I never intended to be rude.”

Next day was Friday, and the voyage was well
advanced. As yet they had not even seen the
smoke of a steamer, but towards evening one was
sighted in the distance, causing some excitement.

“What do you say, Rob?" exclaimed Edith.
“Is she going to turn out a German cruiser?”

- “It's to be hopedznot," replied Rob. “I take
notice the captain is studying her through ,his
glass pretty c osely.”

“I've, got a good glass below," said Walter.

"What do you make of it?” Rob/asked the cap- '

tain a little later. _
“Can’t- tell yet," was the reply. “I shall hold to

A detector and two-stage’ audio ampliﬁer are
necessary to produce suiiicient volume to use a
‘phonograph as a loud-speaker.

   

The Millihenry is a unit used to measure in-
’ ductance. Equal to one-thousandth or a henry.

It is not necessary to disconnect the “B” bat-
vtery from the circuit when the set is not in use.
As long as the ﬁlament is cold and no electrons
are emitted, the space between the plate and
ﬁlament is an insulator and no current can flow
in the plate circuit. Under such conditions the
“B” battery .can be left in the circuit without dis-

charging.

 

- HELPFUL IN A SET

In making a set, purchase ainumber of ﬁxed
condensers of various capacities and try them at
rliﬁerent points in the circuit. such as across the
audio frequency transformers and the phones.

 

The number of plates in a variable condenser
depends on the use it is intended for. A condenser
of forty-three plates, or one rated at .001 mfds
capacity will give a considerable range of wave
lengths. It is best not to use a condenser of
large capacity across the secondary of a loose
coupler when a crystal detector is used. More
than .0005 mfds capacity is‘ not advised for this

Run-Down “B” Batteries are often the cause
of unsatisfactory results with a receiving set.
The best manner to test out “B” batteries is bv
means of a volmeter with a reading of 25 volts
for testing out 22%-volt units, and reading up
to 50 volts for testing out 45—volt units. Elec-
trical instrument ‘manufacturers have not been
slow to realize the need of inexpensive voltmeter-s
for this purpose, with the result that such meters
may now be purchased for as.little as $2.50. One
manufacturer has . developed a special meter
which may be placed in the usual peep-hole of
the radio panel, and which serves to give the
“B" battery voltage or the current consumption
of the ﬁlaments.

When a detector is made to act as a local
oscillator and at the same time as a detector the
process is known as “auto-heterodyne” or “self-
heterodyne." Regenerative circuits act as auto-
heterodynes. That is what takes places when the
set is tuned to receive music and a loud squeal is
heard along with the signals. In such a case the
tube is oscillating at one frequencv, While the
frequency of the carrier wave of \the'sending sta-
tion is at 9. slightly‘diii'e1‘ent frequency. The dif.
ference between the two frequencies is the howl.
To stop the howl the tube must be stopped oscil.
lating. or it must be made to oscillate at the
same frequency as the incoming impulses.

V FARMERS RADIO .iORGAN'IZA'l‘-ION

Farmers in the rural districts of the country
are organizing_ for.the purpose of making the
marvels of radio available to all in the«commu..
nity who have telephones, but no radio: These.
clubs are known as “Farmrads" and are assem-
bled with a farmer owning a good radio set as a
neucleus. When the nearest agricultural station
announces the beginning of market and weather
re one the receiving set is connected to the
to ephone transmitter, receivers are slim down
by all who live on the line or who n persuade
“operator” to connect them in, and from two to
ten familiesrlisten to the up to the minute rc-

ort of cattle and wheat/sales and the weather,‘

h or the marrow.

A good example of the serious light in which .

these farm clubs are regarded is the fact that
many of the country farnracents have installed

sets in _their oiilces foigbotli. service and radio-
. instruction. Amonlgrghese are the agents at Linn’

 FAME AND FORTUNE WEEKLY

horn resonates at certain frequencies, and for
that reason increases the amount of radiation at
those frequencies. Any form of resonance, how-
ever, is undesirable because it is impossible to
increase the amount or radiated energy uniform-
ly at all frequencies within a wide range by this
method. If a. horn is not to distort, its walls
should be non-vibrating and its air column res-
onances, within the range of frequencies used,
should be slight. If we think of the term, “ampli-
ﬁcation” as meaning the increasing of any form
of response by supplying energy from another
source, we see at once that a horn can not am-
plify because it can not supply energy, we learn
from C. R. Hanna of the
Laboratory. It should be evi ent, therefore, that
a horn merely loads the diaphragm in such a way
as to cause more sound energy to be radiated
into the surrounding space from the diaphragm.
The term “radiator” more accurately describes
the action of a horn. A good hem therefore, is
one which causes the diaphragm to radiate almost
uniformly at all frequencies within the desired
limits. This condition is more easil
a phonograph than in a -loud-spe er. In the
phonograph the diaphragm is forced to follow the
vibrations of the record except for the slight
spring of the needle, while in the loud-speaker the
diaphragm is not impelled to follow the variations
of current in the windings because there is no
rigid connection between the two. In the
— phonogi-3:31 it is necessary only that the horn
shall ra te uniformly at diﬁerent frequencies
for a given root mean square velocity of the
diaphragm. In the loud-speaker the horn must
fulﬁll this condition, and also help to cause the
diaphragm to vibrate at a nearly uniform velocity
" when the same current at different frequencies
isypassed through the windings.

By touching or connecting one test point witn
one terminal of a coil and the other test point
with the other terminal of the coil, any coil, _as
for instance the stator or rotor coil of a vario-
coupler, of a variometer of the primary and sec-
ondary windings of a transformer can be tested
for open or broken circuits. if, when the two
test points are connected with the terminals of
the coil, a steady reading is obtained the coil is
all right. If, however, no reading is obtained
such a condition proves that there is an open
circuit between the two terminals.

In testing a condenser no reading should be
obtained when the test points are connected with
the terminals of the condenser aml the rotary
plates are moved in and out of the stationary
plates. A reading indicates that the plates are
short-circuited and a fluctuating needle as the
movable plates are moved indicates that particles
of dust or other conducting material lodged be-
‘tween the plates are short-circuiting the plates
at certain points.

In testing across the terminals of a transfor-
mer winding a high voltage battery is necessary.
A 22% volt one will do. This is necessary be-
cause the resistance of the winding will cut down
the reading appreciably. In testing such a wind-
ing the reading when using a 22 volt battery
will only be several volts. This is as it should
be. The important point is that you get a read-
ing and that the reading. remains steady.

The use of the voltmeter in determining the
condition of a battery need hardly be mentioned.
Whenvthe reading obtained by connecting a volt-
meter across a 22 volt B battery reads less
than 15 volts, the battery should be discarded.

The judicious use of a voltmeter will often
save the experimenter many dollars which would
otherwise be spent in buying new tubes. No mat-
ter how carefully You have wired a set and no
matter how ‘careful y you have been in connecting
the batteries, mistakes are often apt to happen.

‘After your batteries have been_ connected, test
across the F terminals of one of the sockets with
a voltmeter before putting in your tubes. All
that is necessary is to turn on all therheostats
and touch one terminal of the voltmeter to one
F terminal and the other terminal of the volt-

_ meter to the other F‘ terminal. If no read’:-,g ‘L:
obtained, reverse the voltmeter connections. If
the reading is that of the A battery’ all is well
and you can safely put‘ your tubes in their sockets
If a hi her readin is obtained, don't put in your
tubes or they 1 surely be burned out. A
higher reading means that you have .made an
error and have connected B battery voltages
across your ﬁlament terminals.-

- The voltmeter can be used as a polarity in-
dicator by making use of the property of most
of the small meters of not giving a reading un-
less a certain terminal is connected with the posi-
tice of the battery. This can easily be determined
by testing ‘across a B battery and ﬁnding out
which terminal is one which must be con-
nected with the po 've side to give a reading.
When testing other batteries the terminal of the
voltmeter is‘ connected is the positive terminal
of the battery. This feature is especially usehil
in determining the polarity of some batteries

MAGNETIC POLE DISCOVERED BY CAPT.
JOHN ROSS‘ _ ,

The magnetic pole, as distinguished from the
geographical pole, is the point where the needle

. stands vertically, showing the center of terrestrial

magnetism for the‘ Northern Hemisphere. This
point was discovered June 1, 1831, by Capt. John
Ross, says the Kansas City Time.

The amount of the dip of the needle was 89 de-
grees 59 minutes, being thus within one minute
of the pole. Its actual existence where he stood
was further confirmed by me actions of several
horizontal needles. Not one of them showed the
slightest effort to move from the position in which
it was placed.

The ma etic pole is almost directly north of
the city 0 Winnipeg, and within less than 20 de-
grees of that city. To be exact, the location’ of
the north magnetic pole is 70 degrees 5 minutes

and 17 seconds latitude, and 96 degrees 46 min- '

utes asd 45 seconds longitude.

GOT SALT BY INGENIOUS DEVICE

While we all realise the importance of salt to
season and preserve food, it is seldom we stop to
think of the labor entailed in the preparation of
t e ﬁne white crystals that come to us in small
bags and boxes, writes Marguerite Norris Davis
in St. Nicholas. The modern methods of procup
ing and reﬁning salt make an interesting story in
themselves; but it is of the unique plan used by
those famous explorers, Lewis and Clark, that I
am going to tell you now.

The dreary winter of 1805-1806 was spent by
these men and their party on the coast of the
Paciﬁc Ocean, where their trail had ended and
where they waited for spring to open up the
woods and calm the turbulent waters, so that they
might return to civilization. During this time
their supply of salt had become so low that it
was necessary for them to replenish their store
immediately, and _with the resourcefulness that
marked their entire journey to and from the
coast. they proceeded to distill salt from the
oceanl —

A.‘ huge mound of stones was gathered and, by
using the clay from the bed of the Necanicuin
River, which ﬂowed beside the place they had se-
lected for this particular work, they were able
to cement these stones together into a three-
sidedfstove." As nearly as can be gathered from
descriptions of the e'arly_pioneers, who saw it in

-The record for the long-distance travel by a
d to reach his home and master is held, so far
as own, by a collie who returned to his home
in Silverton, Ore., on Feb. 15. After an absence
of six months. when he was lost from his master's
ear “somewhere in Iowa” this dog with the in-

‘G. I-‘. Brazier, restaurant proprietor in Silver-

eastern’ Iowa that the collie disappeared. All
search and extensive advertising were unavailing

for Oregon the dog was seen in Wolcott, which
showed that he was on his inaste_r’s trail. Front

' Wolcott to Silverton is 2,36_4 miles. 'I‘he collie
made it. In the long journey, embracing summer
sun and severe winter weather, the indomitable
dog crossed seven diﬂcsent States, traveled
