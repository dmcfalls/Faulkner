PRISONERS IN A MADHOUSE.

 

A ' Nick Carter, after his novel experience with the cig-
hretterin the carriage of Laura Faxton, did not return
to consciousness forso long a time that he had lost, all
trace oflit. gt * I ,
 And,when'he did revive, it was with an aching head
and ‘a, momentary loss of memory, so that he had not at
once _,the least idea where ‘he was or what had happened
mjhi“m'.’.- ’ T p T ‘ ,
Heilwas lying on his back -“on a couch, in a room that
had, been "darkened by drawn curtains, but he could tell
that daylight was shining without, and he was conscious
‘the ‘saline time that he was somewhere out in the
 smell Vof'the foliage around the place told him
, th‘$f,much,Vand for several moments he remained per-
’ ét.ly“still,» while ‘he tried to collect his thoughts sufﬁ-‘
 to remember ‘what had happened to him,’ , ‘
Nlleirloryrcarne at last; slowly, to be sure, but it're-,
 to: him ;.and as such things will restore themselves

disguised when he lighted that cigarette ; and ‘new;
started to hisifeet and strode across the roomrto a 
at the opposite side of it. n  T,  ‘. V

His disguise had notvbeen touched, and it wash
to him that he had been brought at once‘ to thisplapp
wherever it might be, in the same car_riage in which-he“
had been drugged, that he had been carried’ to the rbom
where he was»"now a prisoner, and left there,» vviithloiu
any investigation concerning him being 1nade—save 
emptying of his pockets; for. he quickly disdoyered. ithai
their contents had been removed very thoroughly 7

There was nothing left to him that they had contained '
save his handkercliiefs, and his capto’rs‘must hav..el‘,ha:.
knowledge of the little weaponshe was in the habi
of carrying in his sleeves, ‘for they, too,were missingfw ”

 
 

Outwardly he was still the senator, and he argued tha
it was more than likely that his captors had not discovj
ered the deception; so the qulestion arose in his,"
whether he should attempt to keep up the deception, or

should admit at once his identity?
‘ l

The question, however, wad to be decided for3hi'1r1f'l'
rather a remarkable manner. ‘ sh  A

Examining the room where he was a prisonerﬁihe
saw only an ordinary apartment, rather large in eictentl
It was/square in shape; there‘ were two windows against
which shutters had been closed on the outside, and"be~
tween himself and the shutters were strong, iron bars
which might well have donereservice at the Tornbtsiin
New York.. 7 T : . I ’_  V ,'

bdoks upon it, and .a hanging lkerosene-lamp_faboxfe" i T‘
there wasasinglel bed in one corner, a rugpcovere.d—._t,he _
ﬂoor over a. matting of straw, two or three pictures hung 3
against the walls, there were four cliairs—':ar1dpthere- we
two doors which he decided, without -Vexamination;  
barred against him. , '   , T 7. 

The mirror, into which he had glanced tosee  hewas“
still the senator,.was above the old—fashioned_, marble; 
mantel, and beside that stood a bureauiofn antiquéldejsigi

He raised one of the windows, and, reachinggthrough
thehars with his ﬁngers, attempted to open the shh~tfet
but duly to ﬁnd that they were securely fastenech 
could only peer past ‘them; as best he might through,
small openings, and discover thereby that the‘Zhou_se ,

returned to the chair that wasbesideftlie.table;,‘_Ia"

and he would only get the answer to  when oneor

 bitterly the baron hated them all, and how sweet this
