days ago you were not able to tell me anything at all, and
it follows that I am as much in the dark about the so-
called mysteries of this case as I ever was. I have put
you off until to-day to tell your story in order that you
might assuredly be in your right mind to tell it. I know
now that you are, and I want it straight; I want it with-
out furbelows-—-without embellishment in any form. I
want facts and not conjectures. I want the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing more and nothing less than the
truth. 1 think with that understanding you may begin.”

“I am ready.” I

“Begin, then, with your experiences here before you ‘
take me_ to Asia with your tale, and if I interrupt you
with questions, answer them if you lean. I will agree to
believe, unless and until I can prove that you have been

mistaken or misled.” ,

. CHAPTER II.

ONLY ONE OF MANY MYSTERIES.

“I will be obliged to refer shortly
first,” said Starbuck. ‘

“All right,” replied Nick. “Go on.”"

“I first made the acquaintance of Idayah there—in the
country called Nepal-——in a place in that country that is ’
called the Sacred Valley. I had toldyou as much has
that in— my office at the Garden,‘ before we were inter--
rupted.”  , ,

“Yes.” ' g 

“And my recollection was remanded to that country ,_ " H
and to my strange experiences there by the sight of a
small weapon that you had with you at theytime-—a wea- g _‘
pon which was one of the instruments used in accomplish-
ing the death of_ the baron.” V _ ‘

“Yes.” a . ' " 7*"

:‘It was a dart, made in the shape of a dagger in minia~ T 
ture, and fumished with delicate, ivory wings, which
open out when it’ is thrown, so that it will fly straight at "
the object at which it is aimed, point first; and the dart
is poisoned, so that death will ensue almost instantly.
after a person is struck by it.” - V‘ ’

“‘Yés.” " ' . - I I "

“Well,'Carter, it had been a long time since I had  l 
thought of my experiences in the Sacred Valley.‘ I had 3' *
schooled myself -to‘ forget them ;, but the sight of tliatlgf .11
dart not only recalled themvividly to mind, but it ‘also; ° ’

“I want to say right here that you have several times
referred to that incident, as if you thought I had taken
anunfair advantageof you in forcing you into a promise
not to move of turn your head while she was there, but
the fact is, Nick, had you done so, she would not have
hesitated to scratch you with that dart: and one scratch
from it would have been instantly fatal. Think of that
when you blame me for that circumstance.”

“All right,” said the detective. “I”understand."

“She had come thereto get me, and she meant to do i

so. '~Your life, if it stood in the ,way of her purpose,

that I was absent, Believing that some day she would
wish to send messages to me there, she had taken two of
her birds with her.”

“But‘how "’

“Wait just a moment. On that first occasion of her
visit there, when I was not there, she went, of course,

‘in her ﬂying machine, about which I shall have more to

say later on; and it was then that she left her ﬁrst
written order for me, to be found by me when I should
reach there.” . ,

“I begin to understand you. She made her way into
the house, from the roof or through one of the upper
windows.”

“Exactly; and she left her order, written in red, for
me to read and to obey when I should have read it.”

The detective nodded.

“That order told me among other things, that each
day at a certain hour, I should leave a certain window
open for the entrance of her messenger, when it should
arrive. It is not strange, is it, that I should have found
the messages when I‘ returned to my room after having
been down-stairs? It is not strange, is it, that when the
time came to leave that window open for the messenger,
that I should not only find an excuse to send Ferguson
out of the room, but that I should leave it myself?”

“No; perhaps not." I

“So much for that part of the mystery. I wish that
all of them could be explained away as easily.”

“Perhaps they can when we once get at it.”

’ “Possibly; possibly; but if that is done, it will be you
who does the explaining, for I have tried—and I have
failed."

“Nevertheless, let us hear the rest of the story."

“Yes. The rest of the strange story, Carter. The
rest of my story, which I have never yet told to living
man.” ‘ - '

_. _“._I had sent you the message. I had told Ferguson that
' I was expecting you, and that you were to be admitted
_'at once when ‘you came, when the inﬂuenceof Idayah
swept across me like atranslucent cloud, and that over-
'po’}vering inclination to sleep took possession of me. I
g was iii the icon: from which I disappeared. I called
 out to Ferguson, intending to order him to remain in the
’, room with me, but when he appeared .in,answer to my
call, I had not power to tell him what I had determined

 I to say. I could only call for some of the tonic he ‘was

in the habit of giving me at stated intervals.
I .. .. ‘?He brought the tonic to me. I took it. I told him
yithat I would rest for a while and not to disturb me. The
«, words were not mine. They were put into my mouth
ahd uttered by me without will of my own. He went out
of the room. The door was closed. I found ‘a diﬂiculty_
in breathing; I hastened to the window and threw it
open for a breath of air; and as I threw it open, a mes-
‘ senger bird ﬂ!‘w into the room. It was one of Idayah’s
i' messengers. _Iknew,it. I recognized it.
_ “It did not alight anywhere. It ﬂew into the room and
"out again, but as it came it dropped‘ its message at my
feet. It'was an order, written in r .”
 “I found it," said the detective, taking‘ a folded bit of
-* paper from his pocketbook and he was startled by an
»£x.clamation from Starbuck. " '

“It said: ‘Open your window wide. I will be with
you in a few moments.’ ”

“And you obeyed, of course.” _

“Obeyed? There was nothing else for ine to do. The
strange part of it all is that at such moments-——that is,
when I receivedsmessagesl like that, I have no inclination
not to obey. My whole desire is to do as she says as
quickly and as surely as possible.” '

‘‘§o your dread of her messages exists only before you

. receive them. It does not exist after you receive them.”

“That is the idea. The dread is.before they come.
After theyare in my possession, I am unqualiﬁedly glad.”

“Well; you had the message before you; you read it;
what did you do then?” ‘ _

“I did as she bade me ‘do. I opened the window wide
—as far as it would go. I stood _back a little way from
it, waiting—-—and presently she appeared.”

“Ah! There is something that I wish to know. I ,
want to know just how she appeared.. I mean that I
wish to know exactly how she got ‘down to your window.

the doors locked on the inside, save for the» one door
into the adjoining room, through which it was known

that you hadnot passed. Your disappearance was a mys- I
tery which for a time seemed impossible of solution. At ' .

last I went to the roof of the building. There is a stair-
way to the roof. It lets out upon the roof through a
hooded doorway. That roof door has been kept locked

ever since the close of the season. The manager of the W ’

had only to place the loop of the rope under my arms, to

“I wondered if it could be the Sacred Valley that I
was approaching. _

“One may descend a mountain much more rapidly than -
one can ascend it; nevertheless, I was fourteen hours
steadily on my feet in making that descent, and when at
last I did reach the bottom of the valley, my fatigue was

. so great that I could scarcely place one foot in front of

the other." . ’

“That goes without saying, Starbuck.”

“I approached a gateway, formed by two immense pil-
lars. I passed through them—between them, that is. I
saw several people, standing as if they were awaiting my ,
approach—and afterward I knew that such was the case.

“But I barely saw them, so great was my fatigue. I
approached them, holding out my hands. I saw only that
all were blonds, as far as hair and skin were concerned,
but with black eyes and handsome features. I saw a tall
man approach us—and then my weariness got the better
of me. I knew that sﬁccor was at hand, and I collapsed.”

“Fainted?" '

“Yes. Lost consciousness. Shall I go on with the
story as it unfolded itself to me ?”

“Yes. I will understand it better in that way.”

“VVhen consciousness returned to me I was in a lofty
chamber. It was wannand airy, and you can imagine
my astonishment when I discovered that it was not only
lighted," but heated with electricity.” ,

“Oh, come now, Starbuck! Don’t go in too heavy, you
know!” . '

“It is a fact, Nick; and it is simple enough after all.”

“All the things relative to that country seem to beg,
marvelously simple, Starbuck. Don't you think so?”

“Yes”—-with perfect eamestness—“that is really the 
most wonderful thing about it all; the simplicity with
which they accomplish things.”

' “Well; it was electricity. What more?”

“Wait. It was electricity. Didn't you see soinething in ' ‘
one of ‘the papers the other day about a chap somewhere
in the West who has discovered how to'draw electricity
from ‘the air, so that‘ he utilizes it for lighting and heating '
his own house and stables?” . '

“Yes, I saw it and read it; but I didn’t swallow it.” ~ “

"That is what is done in the Sacred Valley. The elec-  *3
tricity is drawn from the air. The apparatus is not unlike 
in its arrangement the one that is in use now for the
wireless telegraphy. The electricity is drawn from the
air. Thepower is as great as they care to draw. It but-
does our most powerful generating plants. They do _
everything with it—-have used it for ages. It is not their -* .

“Yes”-dreamily-—-“the first time I ever saw her. She .
was dressed in a robe not unlike the one worn by myself,
with the changes that would be necessary to adapt it to
feminine uses, for it was draped from her shoulders and
formed a train behind her; and there were young girls,
standing silently there whose duty it evidently was t
bear her train when she walked. ‘

“It was of rich brocaded s_tuﬁ‘-—brocaded with gold
and gems, you know. I do not know if I am technically
right in this description, but you will understand what
I mean. Also, there seemed to be a great deal of ivory
used in ornamental ways, and it seemed to have a signiﬁ-
cance. For example, from her shoulders there were two
small wings standing erect, that were made of ivory, and
they were exactly like the wings of that poisoned dart that
we both know about.”

“Go on. What else?”

“Her hair, as you know, is so blond that it is almost
white. ,Over that she wore a crown which, although it
was made of ivory, was in exact imitation of the gong I
had struck in the room where I had awakened, and which
had brought about such surprising results. ‘

“She was standing in front of me, seemingly in the
center of the room,‘ and. save for the ‘young girls who
seemed to be'train-bearers, I_ could see no other person.

“The silence in that great room was absolute. One

\

' might haveheard the ﬁgurative pin drop, «if one had

listened for it.

“I asked her if she could understand me, and she

“ ‘What does it mean?’ I asked her, in amazement: and
taking one more step nearer to me, she replied smilingly:
“V‘You will presently understand.’ ”

CHAPTER VII.‘
THE GREATEST FORCE IN THE WORLD.

“Carter, if I tell you this story of mine so that you can
yappreciateyit, you must try to school your mind to the
‘belief that I’ am telling it about a third person. Do you
think you can do that?”

“I suppose so; but you had better tell me just what
you mean.”

“I mean that the circumstances by which I was sur—
rounded were so strange that when I look back upon
them myself, I ﬁnd it difficult to credit myself with the
belief that it was I and not another who was concerned.

“VVithout retailing too much of the conversation that '

took place between Idayah and myself at that particular
time, I wish to say that I had, unwittingly, to be sure,
fulﬁlled a prophecy in striking that gong as I did; and
that; I_ had sort ofvclinched the thing when I stopped the
vibrations by striking the second one.”

“And that you did wholly by accident.”
I did not even know the gong was there—the
second gong, that is. I threw the stick at the ﬁrst one,
missed'it and hit the other one without having seen it;
‘but the sound of it stopped the vibrations.” W

“And the two, taken together, fulﬁlled a prophecy?”

/“Yes. In a word, the first one sounded the doom of a
high personage; the second one proclaimed a new god-
dess to rule over the land.”

“Ah 1”. said the detective, with a smile. “So the Sacred
Valley is a land that is ruled by a goddess, eh ?”

“Exactly. It is altogether too common and too ordi-
nary to say a queen;0and in reality Idayah is much
greater, much more powerful, than a queen could be.” ‘

“Do you mean to tell me that Idayah is the—-
goddess?” I

“Precisely.” ;

“Then what—— But go on with your story. It is not

well to anticipate. I presume we will get to it all after

a while.” ‘ A

“Yes.” , , : A _ _

doom, eh?” '

' for it.” . . -e - » I J i

"Certainly; it is a scientiﬁc fact; it amounts almost tora 2

“It is a law of nature, as you would understand if you
had ever visited the. Sacred Valley, where the law of

to what I was telling you.” ’ ‘

"Yes .>~ e - i V;

“In every household there is the masculine and th
feminine element. In a household where there are both ‘ ‘V
men and women, and several of each, if the voices of the ‘S ii
men aswell as of the women were attuned to the same
tone, theresult would be as__vou said a moment ago.” '

“How was that?’ -- ,. " . .

“You said if they all got to talking at once, the house i
would fall down about their ears.” ' i

"Yes.” *

“That is literally true, althoughit soundstpreposterous.
Vibration is the greatest force in the world, and theleast
understood of any force or power, although it is the most
common. If the men and the women of a household,
arranged like that, talked in the same tone, there could
never be any conversations at all. Absolute silence would
be the rule.” , ‘ _ ’

“And so_in ‘each house in the Sacred Valley there are
two tones, eh? Do the men have ornaments that respond
to their voices, as well as the women?” ' ‘ I

"Assuredly; arid the consequence is that when men or
women are alone in a house without the presence o£ one
of the other sex, they d_o not talk.” .

“ hat would seem to me to be a delightful arrange v:
ment for suppressing gossip." ' '

“For instance——and you must always hear in mind that
it is a silent land, for silence is the law of nature and
sound is the breaking of the ru1e—let us suppose that

“Will you repeat it to me ?”

“It is this: ‘-The vibration which soundg the doom of a

“But,” said the detective, “I don’t understand."
“I will explain,” replied Starbuck. “Listen.”

“ ‘The vibration which sounds the doom of a king shall
be broken by the voice of him who shall rule, through the
virtue and by the grace of the daughter of the king, who
shall be the goddess" over all the world.’ ”

Starbuck quoted the prophecy again, slowly and sol-
emnly, keeping his eyes fixed sharply upon the face of
the detective as he did so; but when Nick remained silent,
he added :‘ .

“Carter, it is true that I struck the ﬁrst gong all the
way down the cups, with the leather-covered hammer I _
found there; it is also true that the sound of that gong 
announced the doom of the king V; it is true, too: that pres-

V“That room is what is called the Dome-room of the‘

palace, Nick. There are aboutifour hundred gongs there,
any one of which I might have struck. It was because I
was expected to strike one of them, or to start one of
them to vibrating by the sound of my voice, calling out,
that I was left there. My own fate was to be determined
in that way. It was the fulﬁlment of th.-ir prophecy that
I should havestruck the doom-gong and then stilled it, or
rather, broken the vibration, almost at once.”
' “I see. You were a creature of circumstance.”

“Or the mere tool of fate. You and I both know that
my getting lost in the first place, followed by my wander-
ing into that valley, and the resultant incidents, were all
merely incidents-; nothing else. But you could not make
one of those people- believe that I was not born into
the world thirty years ago for that very purpose. It

- makes no difference that I was born here in America and

had never heard of their Sacred Valley; it made no dif-
ference that I had a passicﬁ for hunting big game, and
that my taste took me into those wilds; it made no dif-
ference that it was perfectly natural that I should get
lost, and seeing houses that were inhabited by human be-
ings should go to them in search of help; it made no
differdice that I should have been fatigued to the point
of dropping dead among them when I made my appear-
ance, or thatdthe striking of the gong and the things that
followed should have been accidents. They did not and

'do not view it so.”

she can perform miracles which would astound you.”
The detective shrugged his shoulders and smiled.

 

“Well,” he said, “let us get back to the great room in ‘

which you were alone together.”
Starbuck was silent‘for a moment, and then he said:
“She had just told me that she could give me the

' balm of eternal youth. I could not fail to understand the

signiﬁcance of her utterances, coupled as they were with
the death of the king and with the prophecy that accom-
panied that circumstance.”

“In a word, she meant that you should be her husband,
and you knew what she meant.” "

“Yes.” _

“How did the suggestion strike you at the moment?”

Starbuck actually blushed under the detective’s con-
centrated gaze; then he replied:

""Nicl<, I am a man. I was a man then—and three
years younger than I am now; scimething more than

V“Into it the body of the dead king had been borne.
He was laid out in state, already, in the center of the
room; and around the bier were grouped the men I had
mentioned. ‘

:‘Idayah whispeﬁd to me as we passed through the.

“ ‘Go forward when I stop. Stand at the dead king’s

“I passed to the head of the corpse and,
touched the dead king on the brow with the index ﬁnger
of my right hand; and then I raised my head and my
eyes and slowly, one after another, met the eyes and the

save Idayah herself would understand me if I did speak,

no matter in what language I should utter words. I
. remained silent, and she pinched my arm with a severity

which almost made me ‘cry out.

What would
you have done under those circumstances, Nick F”
. “Search me! I give it up, Starbuck. What did you
do 2” ' . '

“‘I suddenly .re_membered two things. I recalled the
fact that every voice that made a sound started bells to
ringing somewhere; that is, every voice started into
existence some kind of vibratory motion, and I believed
that Idayah knew that my voice would do so, and that it
was expected of me by the others. The other thing that
I remembered was that once, long ago, I heard an elocu—
tionist ,named Roberts recite Poe's ‘Bells,’ and that in
doing so he imitated the droning_of a bell to perfection.

“But the pinch gave me inspiration.

“You know that I have rather a resonant baritone
voice? Well, I opened my mouth and sang out with
-all the power of my lungs, the word ‘Bell-l—ls!’ holding
“ the sound of it upon my voice as long. a time as my
breath would permit. A ~
., "BelI.r!” I sang; and the result was startling.

 “The room resounded with a crash of bells as if a
# thousand of them had suddenly became alive at once. It
 was deafening. The sounds, or, rather, the vibration,
traveled putside the room and it set other bells to going,
far and near, until the world seemed to be alive with
the ringing of bells.‘ -

 ‘VI turned to Idayah-with a startled look, but she was
 smilingly upon me, evidently well pleased by
.\vhat 1 had done. ' _

7 “You may believe it or not, but after a little;‘those vi-

around us.

“Then. and again to my amazement—— to my utter
amazement—the ﬁrst one of the twenty men who were

present in the room with us took up the refrain.”

“Bells, again?” asked Nick.

“Yes. Don't you see that they were only copying me?
Only using the sound that I had used to indicate the
fact that they had accepted me?” _

“I begin to understand. It was not that you.had hit
upon the right word, but that they would have made use
of the same word you did, no matter what it might have
been."

“Exactly. The ﬁrst one called out bells as I had done,

NEW NICK CARTER‘ WEEKLY.

Interruption and its consequences that had been expressed ‘

27

instinctively, the weapon which he had in his sleeve ap-
peared in his grasp as if by magic, and the muzzle of it
covered the heart of the woman who had tried to kill
him.

But she seemed to be totally unmindful of that; en-
tirely careless of the fact that death threatened her quite
as emphatically as it had threatened the detective a mo-
ment ago, for she was smiling into Nick Carter's eyes,
her gaze was unrufﬂéd, she seemed unmoved, indifferent,
contemptuous.

Idayah she was, too, in all her wondrous beauty--in
all the power of her matchless fascinations; and perceiv-
ing that she paid no heed to his weapon, Nick allowed it
to slip again into his sleeve out of sight. .

For a moment, nobody spoke at all.

In the interest that Nick felt at the interruption, he
forgot to look toward Starbuck. Had he done so, he
would have seen that the New Yorker remained where
he had fallen; that he made no attempt to arise’; in fact
that he appeared to be bereft of the. power to move.

And while that silence lasted, Idayah continued to gaze

silently into Nick Carter’s eyes, and he was conscious of i

the -fact that he began to feel the spell of her presence
creeping upon him. 7

He told himself vaguely in that moment that there
was certainly something mysterious about this woman;
something to be dreaded-—something to be loved also, he
did not doubt, since he had heard the story of Starbuck.

With the consciousness that he was beginning to feel
that thrill of power which She so mysteriously exerted
over all who came in contact with her, came also the de-
termination to resist it to the utmost, and he threw back
his head and straightened his shoulders, while he smiled
back into her eyes as calmly as she ‘did it; and he said
coolly: ‘ , '

“I suppose, Idayah, that you intended to kill me with
that little dart of yours; eh?”

“No,” she replied as calmly as he had spoken. “It 1
would not have injured you, more than the prick of a pin '
‘would do so. . It would have put you to sleep-—to sleep—-
"and in an hour from now you would have been--—--’’ -

She stopped and Nick waited; but when she did not
continue what she was saying but only smiled upon him,
he asked: ’ —

‘ “I would have been-—where?”
