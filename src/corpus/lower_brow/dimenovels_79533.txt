’ acters, who lived and moved upon the river——and was
»- known as “Pete Dunl<in's house.” .
There I found Raoul and his party, all well and all
together. They were boisterously glad to see me. Raoul
, was not as noisy as the others. ‘It was not_his ‘manner;
. but, apart from’ that, Igdetected in his silenée something
‘ unusual; and, as soon as I could get free from the Mon-
tagnacs, I approached and questioned him. We had no
secrets from each other. ‘

I . “Raoul,” I asked, “what brings you here? Have you
‘ - ‘ been to Natchez? Why’ did you not write to me ?”
._ He leaned forward and answered me in two words:
"“Alex Balatier!’-’ A ’ » I
A I understood him——it is too long a story to tell now;
but it meant vengeance! I motioned toward the broth-
« 2 ers. . ’
‘ ' “They would not leave me,” he said. “I wouldmuch
' rather have come alone.‘ They know nothing of the mat—
'ter. ' .
Henshrugged his shoulders. It was “Voila _a Dieu,”
, as we say in the provinces.
 ‘5Will he belrhere ?” I inquired.‘
' “I am waiting for him,” he replied. >.
5 He unbound‘/‘from, his wrist a deerskin pouch, and
handed it to me. is .
I  “You will take charge of this, now that’ you are‘ here,"
, he said. “It is the money we got at St. Louis." /

No half—dozen

Mighty hunters and trappers were they, and great among
those‘ who had fought in‘the wars with the Indians.
Pierre, Rubel,, Aloise, Gaston, Chaney, and Antoine
M ntagnac were they called. They were always togeth-
er theydressed and looked alike. What .one did the
others followed. At home we called them "Les _F~reres
Jimius,-pthe Twins.” Rubel. was the smallest among
them; he stood six feet and one inch, and once had killed
is.‘ black bear on ‘the Abbitibbee in single combat, with
no other weapon than his knife. ‘Yet, to Raoul Pap-
fporn. these counted themselves only as children. Where
, coufd you ﬁnd a man like him? He lacked‘ barely three
