DHAPTER I.—Bob Beach and His Friend Dick.

' with a. sympathetic look at the pale, thin face of

548 week, and yet in that time had come to love
V hi'm as much as if ‘he were his brother.
., «‘_‘A little worse, if anything,” replied Dick
‘Dudley, in a listless tone, as he gazed dreamily
‘from his chair on the hotel veranda over the deep
blue sea that lay spread out before them both.
' It was a semi-tropical , scene-—the Island of
 Bermuda, in the Bermuda group-—where the two
ads were. The air was warm and balmy, the
“sun's heat being tempered by a constant sea
breeze. The sky was the deepest blue, while the
water was so clear asvto reveal, even to its lowest
Fdepths, the many varieties of ﬁsh sporting among

Dick did not reply at once.

*' “How did this ailnient of yours first come on?"
“It began with loss of appetite and a slight

that kind——~and I paid little attention to the feel-

~ ,,,family physician and have a talk with ‘him. I

or?,tw.o. afterward, duringwhich I felt much bet-
.ter,,I was told tovvisit the specialist." He ex-
amined" me, asking me a lot of, questions, par-
ticularly if I had been handling anything of a
poisonous nature.” ‘ ' '
,“Of' a poisonous nature?” said Bob; ~
C; “Yes. I said no, but he'seemed*to disbelieve
me. He told "me he would communicate with the
' family doctor, on whom I must call that evening.

better‘, for a few days and then suddenly I. was
taken bad. Mr.’ Larue took me to an entirely
new doctor. He looked me over, said he could
sacure me, but he didn’t. I got steadily worse.
Mr; Larue then seemed to lose coriﬁdence "in the
doctors and told me to prepare for a trip to these
‘islands. We came here, and after the first few
days I’ve been steadily going downhill. ’Whg.t-

him. . * ' ‘ v

Mr. Lame believed he had just committed a.

murder. He had, in his opinion, removed the

scheme he was working against his nephew.

Bob judged, from the short conversation he
had had ‘with him. that he was tired of the-island
and was anxious to get back to Wall Street.

A‘ man with the thoughts of one murder fresh  h

on his soul was in a ﬁt of humor to_do most an -‘

that there was no telling what might not hep: ‘

then got a card fromlhim, admitting him to the
gallery of the Exchange.

'He went around there to see how stocks were‘

coming on. Then he went to lunch and spentthe
rest of the day, up to three o’clock, in the waiting-
room of the little banking and brokerage house
, on Nassau street, where he used to put this deals
‘through when he was a messenger. The back of
_th_e room was occupied by a big blackboard, on
which the market quotations were chalked up_by
a small boy as fast as they came in over a wire.
The market was rather quiet, but there were in-
_ dications of a rise in prices, and the room was
i fairly crowded with cheap s eculators. The ad-
vantage of this place to sma operators was that
as. low as five shares of any stock on the list could
lie bought on margin, whereas no regular broker
, would take an order for less than 100 shares.
‘ That made a whole lot of difference to eople
with on] $50 to $100 to invest in the specu ative
arena. Tllhe only difference between the place and
a “bucket-shop” was that business was done in
regular form there. If ‘a customer bought ﬁve
shares of any stock at the little bank the stock
‘ was actually purchased and held for their ac-
count. Nevertheless, the brokers were down on
' the establishment" like a, cart load of bricks, be-
cause of the temptation it offered to messenger
boys and small clerks to speculate in the market.
Many an employee had lost his position through
. nit, but it ﬂourished, just the same, and the people
,who owned it made money. When the Exchange
closed at “three, Bob strolled around to see a
Young lady stenographer ina New street office.
She was a particular friend of his, and had given
h1m'a tip which cleared him several hundred idol-
lars. He.had testiﬁed his gratitude by present-
ing her witha handspme gold locket. He walked
1_nto thepoﬂice and asked for her. She came out
wgmto the reception-room and gave '
welcome.

A They went outside. _, ‘ '
' ‘!What is the tip?” asked Bob.
‘ “The directors of the D. & P. road willhold

At that moment Bob thought about his tip.‘

He told Dick about it. _ k y 
“It’s a sure winner,.and I’m going to buy ﬁfty
shares. I’ve just got money enough to cover
that. How would you like to go in with me'”o'n’ 0

“How much will it take?”

“Is that all?‘ Look here, old chap, I’ve got,’ _
$10,000 that is doing nothing. Now supposeyou 
take that and put it up on 1,000 shares, half for , ‘
me and half for yourself? If we win it will give

' you a little extra money.”

“That would be ﬁne, bu_t I don’t want to: use;
your money. I don’t want to graft on-. you be-
cause you’re well off,” replied Bob. 

“Nonsense! You take the money and do as-I. -.

As the boys spun around the corner they ran

coming up_the' avenue. ’

“Hold on! What’s your hurry?" asked the of-
ﬁcers, grabbing them.

, .“We’re running away from three men who at-

they come now.” '

 ‘this satisfaction, and reached home all right... Bob
' -and Bessie reached their office about the"same

time, Monday morning. On the girl's table lay,

 a package of cards Bob had printed for her.
_ , They talked for half an hour, and then the girl,
putting a few of the cards in her pocket, started
out to drum up trade, while Bob put in an hour

, reading the Wall Street news and studying the

. T previous weeks’ market reports. It wasn't neces-
. sary for him to go around to the little bank to
y see theduotations when the Exchange opened, for
they all came out on the tape of his ticket. Still,
he-found it lonesome in the oflice alone, so he

. went around to the bank for the sake of seeing
the crowd and listening to the conversation of

i  the. speculators. He didn't return to the gofﬁce till
I‘ , after lunch, and then he found that Bessie had

‘secured some work and was busy at her machine.‘

 pf late, and had accumulated the $30,000 he put
up on N. & P. from a comparatively small -be-
ginning. His luck was so phenomenal that they
co;;lldn’t keep the matter quiet, and so the news
grad_ually_ got. around the Street. Most of. the
brokers were incredulous, but there were some
who, for reasons, took the trouble to investigate
the matter. It soon become known that the young
o rator had his oﬂice on the sixth floor of the
-lzifmpton Building. A reporter, hearing the ru-
mor of _the boy’s great luck, called at Bob’s oﬁice
to interview him on the subject. .

“Is it true that you made $50,000 or more out
of the recent slump, ,Mr. Beach?” he inquired,
hauling out his notebook.
, “If I did make it I don’t think it is anybody’s
business but my own," replied Bob, politely.
. V “Anything out of the usual run is a matter of

‘general interest to the public,” replied the news-
‘pa erman, cheerfully. _ '
V ‘I don’t believe that a person's private affairs
should bepublished.”

“When a boy—-you are under twenty-one, I
"believe, Mr. Beach—makes a coup in the stock

 

done, the public are curious to learn how you did

, .,\“You admit, then, that you did win a consider-
a__.blie amount through the late slump?”

‘ . ‘.‘,I suppose you'll ask me next whether I robbed
_’a_. bank to get the money necessary to make -the

.‘5Hardly; but the public will be interested in
learning the successive stages by which you
chieved ur success.”

/ o you know there were any successive

.‘_‘It might, but I judge that it didn’t. You

and gradually worked up to the point that enabled
you to command that capital with -which you went

“Colby & Dennison,” was painted on the door, .
and also ornamented a tin sign downstairs, but
even the janitor. of the building. didn’t knou/.;what
kind of business they were in. At odd times a
succession of visitors called on them. in answer
to an advertisement,inserte_d in a Sunday paper,
and the ﬁrm generally separated these people
from a $5 bill, if the callers had that much about
them; if they didn't, Colby &. Dennison com-
promised on a lesser amount. I

What the two sharpers gave in return for these
contributions was a-matter which rested entirely
between them, and their victims. Colby & Den-
nison always went through three orpfour of the
morning papers. They found it proﬁtable in the
long run. Colby was the first to see the story
about Bob Beach, and he pointed it out to Den-
nison. - ‘

‘‘Here’s another embryo Jay Gould,” laughed
Colby. “Made $50,000 in a recent speculative"
panic in Wall Street. He must be feeling his oats
now. I think we oughtto make his acquaintance.
We might be able to transfer a few of his simo—
leons to our pockets. If we're going to continue
to eat we've got to raise the price.”  \

Dennison read the article and then -looked at
his partner. , .

“Any proposition tQ,_make?" he asked. j

“We might buy a do‘zen blank stock certiﬁcates,
have the name of some mining company printed
in, ﬁll them out for 100 shares each, sign the
names of bogus officers, and then one of us could
visit this Wall Street kid and try to work the. .-
shares off on him,” said Colby. _ '

“We might do it, but I'm afraid it would be
energy wasted. That certiﬁcate business has been
worked to death. Think up something else,” saitl.
Dennison. .

“Think up something yourself. You represent
half of the brains of the ﬁrm.” ' ,

“I wonder where he, keeps his money. _.He
couldn’t put but a small amount, in a savings"
bank, and_ a boy isn’t allowed to cary a business .
account with any of the other banks,’ He must
either, keep it in a safe‘ deposit box, or he has "a
safe in his oﬂic-3 to deposit it in. We might visit - V
him, of'r‘ering some e_xcuIsei and if he has a safe we ‘Ix
might intimidate him into opening it, so that we; V
could get away with whatever money we found '
inside of it.” ' ‘ ’ —  3

“And if we got caught at that game we would 4'
not getlless than ten years. I, am willing to
V I" ain’t stuck on breaking it
to that extent." » - ' , » ;

“Colby, you are becoming toolcautious in your
old age,” chuckled Dennison. “We’ve got to ‘live, ‘
and I think this young Wall Street winner might .v
just as well: contribute to our sulJP°l‘t as not."

“We’ve got to be cautious if we want to keep
out of jail.” , . - 
\ “Colby, it’s the man with nerve who succeedsﬁ’ . ,

“I don’t think anybody can accuse us"of want _ "
of nerve." ; - ‘ '

thing altogether.” , .'.‘,w- “

" them, and /had helped them out before. So after
making their plans they went to 9. cheap beanery

an hour later they cameoiit on the street, looking
.~like a pair of clericals.‘ Colby’s face was dis-
guised with a pair’ of mutton-c'ho.p _Whiskers,

_WhiCh heirreverently called “ﬁre—escapes,” while-
‘he alluded'"to as‘

‘Dennison had a beard, which
“lace * curtains..’’,

, In any event they would hardly have been rec-

‘ whence they made their way to Wall Street, and

inquired for t'he'Hampton~ Building- They walked

solemnly into the elevator and asked to be let out‘,

_at' the sixth floor. . 3

' Bob was generally on hiszgway home. The sharp’-.
ers~were notyfamiliar with the quitting time of

stayed to look them over. Bessie ﬁnished’ her

_Bob then ent on" and told what followed,
which include his arrest, temporary incarcera-
tion in; a cell, and his ultimate release through the
help-of his friend Dick. Mrs. Beach and her
daughters looked very solcmn\'\'vhen Bob concluded
his, story. They were wondering what would hap-
pen to Bob in the event that the man he shot
should "die. Naturally, his mother voiced her

‘Nevertheless, -his mother and sisters took a

himself more in the limelight than ever. The

Bob smiled, and nothing that the trader said
could make him commit himself one waypor the,
other. Broker Hill, felt greatly disappointed, ,a.,n,d -
he left without having obtained any deﬁnite ass

which was transferable, for same.

This represented the price of the 25,100 shares
of the little railroad’s stock at 21. Then, with
the certiﬁcate in his pocket, he visited the widow
at Tuxedoville and had an interview with her.
When he left the house she had the certiﬁcate in
her possession, with the following written across
it:

“Pay the face of this certiﬁcate of deposit to
Mrs. Martha Gage on presentation of Certiﬁcate
No. 1, of the D. & S. R. R. C0,, for 25,100 shares,

‘ made out in the name of the undersigned.

“ROBERT BEACH.”

Next day the widow had the stock transferred
to Bob, and presented the new certiﬁcates in his
name, with the certiﬁcate of deposit,.at the New
York bank. She received the money and the
stock was sent by the bank’s messenger to Bob
at his oﬂice. Next day, Bob went to the lawyer
who got him out of the shooting scrape and had
a talk with him; the result of this‘w_as an ap.pli-
cation to the New Jersey Legislature for an ex-
tension of the franchise of the D. & S. road to
Crystal Lake. ' .

The matter was quickly put through within the
month, during which Bob had other visits from
the representative of the new company that Tel)‘:-

gained for being on the point of expiring, enough
cam was called for to ay for them. According] ,
an offer of 25 was ma e to Bob for his stock. I-its
declined, and then said to his visitor:

"I have just secured an extension of the road
franchise to Crystal Lake.‘ I am going to build
the road from Tuxedoville there.”

‘His caller gasped.

“I have a backing of ﬁve millions to a project
to turn Crystal Lake into a magniﬁcent summer
/resort. ‘Do you want to buy me out?
your company has purchased 20,000 shares of the

'road’s stock, but Ihave a corner on it, for I
control a hundred shares more than half. I am -

master of the market and the situation, too. The

' annual meeting will be held next month. I shall

have a majority in the board of directors, and
will elect my own oﬁicers unless you want to take
the controllinginterest oif my hands at 50. I

V . will accept half cash and half stock at 40 in your

company. 'That is my ultimatum.”

There was a meeting of the new company-next
day, and the stockholders experienced a shock
when Bob’s proposition was laid before them. It
happened that a man, Bob Jones, was a large
stockholder in the new company, and, when he
learned that Bob was the master of the situation
he was mad clean through.

2 - “I’ll go around andsee him and make him ‘haul’

in his horns,” he said. ~“We will give him just
25 in cash. Send me a certiﬁed check for
$627,500 to my office, and,I’l1 go around and make

waited for Mr. Jones to appear. As he didn’t — I-
show up by one‘o’clock, Bob handed the certi-
ﬁcates to Bessie and told her if Jones called with
a certiﬁed check for $1,255,000 she was to take
it and li'and.him the securities. Half anihour '
later Broker Jones appeared. He asked for Bob, '
and was told he was out. ~ ,
“He told me to give you the two certiﬁcates of ;"
the D. & S. road if you brought a certiﬁed check
in payment,” said Bessie. zw ,
“I’ve got the check,” said the broker, pulling it”
out of his pocket. ‘ .~ g,
The girl pulled the certiﬁcates out of a drawer. '
“I’ll take the check,” she said. ‘
He handed it to her, and then she saw it was‘
made out for only half of the right amount.
“This‘_isn’t right,” she said. “I can’t give you ;‘
the certiﬁcates for that.” ‘ 4: 
“No?” snarled Jones. “Then I’ll have to take -'5’a_»

“You sha’n’t have these certiﬁcates!” cried
Bessie, springing upon the desk. ’ .

stop me?” - ‘ v 
He was in the act of following the plucky girl 
when Bob opened the door and walked into the
oﬁice. i

“You can have them if you have brought a;

“Then the deal is off.” _ ' 1‘
A heated argument followed, and Jones  '

the company was obliged to acce t Bob’s te ‘

shares of the new company, which ultimately‘:
turned out a great success. Bob sold 5,000 shares}
to Dick for 50, though they couldn’t be bought at
all in the market. That gave him a cash capital;
of ‘ three-quarters'of a million, and as hisstook‘.
inbthe company was worth half a million more at
least; he could at least call himself 'a boy mn

and was one of the most thriving towns.of its

‘.-':.S>0me of -the boys who worked in Bagley’s Mill ,

“Fred Jones is all right!” ‘
There were some"of’the remarks that Frank , "
Timlin, the pitcher of the Peerless Baseball Club, 
heard, and- his face lighted up as he caught the . 
spirit of the boys. ’
“All right, fellows, I won't say another word,” — ‘V
he declared. “We will do our best to-day, and ‘
it won't be my fault if we don't beat the Edger- , , L.
ons. ’: I :.
“That sounds better, Frank," spoke up Harry
Bates, the captain and ﬁrst baseman of the team.
“But just- the same, boys, we’re in a hole, and no
mistake. I've been thinking all the week who to
try out at shortstop. I haven’t thought of a fel-' ’
low who can play the. position anywhereas. well
as Joe Norris did. I'm going to be’ frank with
you, fellows. The rest of the ositions are ﬁlled
just to my’ liking, but out of) the seven extra
members we've got there isn't a boy who could, , :
play the position of shortstop and do good work.
The only thing to do is to take Lon Seaver off
second and let him play short, while Dan Rear-

. don can come in from centerﬁeld and play second.
I‘

We can ﬁnd some one to playcenter om the ’
extra players, I suppose. I just wish some good ..
player would comealong and want to join our v
club, boys. Some one who could put up a rattling‘ :
game as short! But that isn’t possible. There

are very few boys who play short like ‘Joe'-
Nor~ris." ‘ _ 3 ;

“Say!” spoke up a boy of sixteen, who was a
little stout, and not quite as tall as he should:
have been for his age, stepping’ forward from,th,e
cinder road, where he had been standing all alone, , ~
listening to the conversation of the young ball,  ,
players, “if you, fellows don't .mind I’d like to ~'
become a member of the Peerless Ball Club. I've , 
heard that you have a rattling nine, and that is i
just the kind that I’d like to join." J 1

‘‘It’s Sam Walters, the boywho just came ‘to:‘”7
work at the mill this week,”, said Pete Perkins,»
a rather gawky-looking fellow, who played third
base. “He told me he’s played ball a whole lot,
fellers.” . ' ' ' V .:

Sam Walters was nothing if not‘ strong and ‘
healthy-looking. , p ’ ‘ . . ‘ » «

He was bright and handsome, too, and though’ .

a triﬂe short and stout, one look at him from an 1 _
expert would have told plainly that he wasps 
quick as ayﬂash and possessed of plenty of en» :
durance. ‘ ' . "

Nearly all the members of the club knew the

 

lot of Pete Perkins, who was the son of a farmer ;

him. _. , . ,
Pete did not look as though he was a very

 

have made a mistake, for he was an expert at ,.
the game of ‘baseball, and covered third bag with .1,‘
a ‘great deal of cleverness. of » ' - '
The farmer boy stepped up with no little show
of pride and introduced ‘Sam’ Walters as the V , _
who had come. down from New York to live and“,
work in Sharpton. v ’ ’
The whole crowd shook hands with him, and
they seemed glad to make his acquaintance 51!3t

then.

“I, m3,y7be_able to help'you fellows 

     

    

is if youwant tot ke me tint-as an

 .V‘!_

 

of__your club... Pete -tells me that all that is neces-
, sa_ry is a two-third vote of the members and the
'_ payment of two dollars from the applicant.
Heres my two dollars.” , ‘ . '
“We’ve ‘got to hold a special meeting of the
club,-but we can do that right after dinner,” re-
plied Captain“ Harry Bates. ’ “Of course you will
be welcome, in the club I, feel sure of that. But
, can you play shortstop?”

“That is the position I have generally heldony

the teams I have played with/‘Sam answered.
g“You have never seen us play, have you?”
, ‘‘No,' but I have seen the Edgertons play,
though. I saw them last Saturday at Ridgewood
Park,” . '

“You did!” '

The boys crowded around him with eagerness
depicted on their faces. ‘

“Yes——they are a pretty strong team.”

,‘_‘«Do you—you think you could play at short-

stop against them with any degree of success?”

asked Frank Timlin, the pitcher.
_ “I certainly think I can,” was the retort. “I
am only what some might call‘ a small boy, I
- know, but I have played with.a better team than
the Edgertons.” ' ~ -~ l 1.
“Whewl”. cried the captain of the Peerless

nine. ,"‘Boys, I guess we are all right. If that is

the case.” r _
, “Let’s us hurry home, so we ‘can get back to
the club-house,” suggested Fred Jones. V
This was received with universal favor, as far
"as the members of the club were concerned, and

off they _went at a brisk walk, Sam Walters‘ "

.. walking with them between the captain and third
baseman.

’ »  They went‘ to their respective homes, and ‘by _ p  it

‘ ;one.o’cloek nearly all were at the loft over the

feed store on the main» street, which they had

i . -rented for their ,clu'b-roomat a nominal cost.

' 'Though there were no walls or partitions in the?

_ ‘place, it was quite a snug room. The pitched

;  roof was high, and there was plenty of room for

* , a trapeze and other adjuncts to a small" gym-

, nasium. T’ '

 V-Indian clubs and dumb-bells were there, show-

" ,' ing that the boys kept their muscles ‘in, order
during’ the winter months,'and the big pot—shaped

stove‘ that had kept‘ off the chill in winter was

- covered well with paper and stowed in a corner.
T A .desk,’some benches,‘ and a fewchairs were
about all the furniture the big room contained,

L ,b_ut,it answered, the purpose ‘of the boys.
" .’ None of them belonged to wealthy families, so

2 ~‘th‘e'y had to be satisﬁed witlmwhat they could,

get. * . ~

K 2 Therewas ‘a vast difference between the quar-_

ters of the.Peerless Baseball Club and those of

. the Sharpton Athletic Club-
