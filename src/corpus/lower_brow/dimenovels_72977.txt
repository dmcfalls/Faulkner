“There you are, Pansy,” he said in a tone of

satisfaction. “Don’t say I never done nothin’ for '

The girl "thanked him in a shy manner. She

that thev would start for home. Micky accom-s

them and went home. Supper was all ready and

Pansy arrived. Myrtle fairly gasped when she
saw the condition of her sister. 7 ' .

was acquainted with them. v ‘ »
“She would have been drowned only for you,'.

of the mining village. He explained to the jus-
/tice what had happened on the culm—heap that
evening‘, and said he thought Packy Saunders
ought to be punished in some way for bullying a
little girl like Pansy, and nearly causing her

death. -Mr. Robinson asked the girl to tell her '

story, which she did. ,

“This «isn't the ﬁrst complaint I’ve had about
that laid.” said the justice. “He has a bad repu-
tation. It’s'time he was brought up with a round

, stable. When Darrellireturned with the oﬂicer
the justice handed the constable a warrant for

Sanders cottage and serve it. Jimmy" Sanders

was .in the yard when he saw Constable Green

 constable was after his brother, rushed intothe

‘ “What else would hewant me for?” growled
Packy as he laid his hand on the back fence and
prepared to vault over it into the yard of a vacant

bill out of Dan Crowley’s pocket ‘last night when

of the day on which the conversation recorded in
the previous chapter took place between the engi- —

Thus it was when Dick blew the whistle which

i ‘ended work for the day. Martin Drake left\the

engine-room thoroughly disgruntled and with an
ugly ‘scowl on his countenance. On the follow-
ing night, at the regular monthly meeting of the
Keystone Branch of the Miners’ Alliance, Drake
‘brought his grievance before the members. He

" was listened to with attention, and‘ was supported

by half a dozen of the best speakers. When the
Drake bunch had said all they wanted to, Mur-
ray got up. Martin glared at him like a wild
beast. ’ He dreaded the engineer's cool, unimpas-
sioned way of appealing to the common sense of

bers to go slow about taking issue on a matter

Sanders nodded. and the two men left the tablet’ i
and walked out into the night. As they did so a
boy’s face appeared from behind a screen a couple .
of feet away and watched their exit from the tav- ‘*=
ern. The face belonged to Dick Darrell, who had i
been visiting a sick miner who roomed on the sec- ‘
0nd floor of the tavern. He had been on his way
out through, the public room when he saw Drake . 
and Sanders at’ the table. Not wishing to be seen 4 ,;

CHAPTER ‘Vl.—'In

Next day was Sunday, and Dick went out walk-

ing. in the afternoon with Myrtle. Micky,Grady

_ also went out walking with Pansy about half an

'_ " ' ‘hour before. Though neither pair was aware of

, the fact, they each took the same direction down
the river. ~

“Do you suppose Packy Sanders. has left the
neighborhood for good?” asked Myrtle.

“I guess he has,” replied Dick. “Somebody
must have tipped him off to the fact that Con-
stable Green was after him. At any rate, he V
didn’t show up at the breaker next morning, and
hasn’t been seen around the village since.» So the
constable, who was looking for him, told me yes‘

‘tier-day. Micky tried to pump his brother Jimmy,
who works with him in the breaker screen-room,
but Jimmy, who handles the truth very carelessly;
said he didn’t know where Packy was.” . .

By this time they had got below the long culm-

, _ heap and were approaching the stranded coal
v , barge, which lay close to the riverbank. Then it
was that Dick noticed smoke rising‘ above the;
yiéopes of a thick ‘clump of trees not farfrom the
arge.
. .,  “I wonder _who’s bllilt that fire and what for?”
 ‘he said- ‘ V _
 2’, ‘5Probab1y some iof the boys from the village,”
A ‘ replied Myrtle. ,
  : Dick sniffed the air. ~

""‘Do you know I smell tar?” he said. “They

‘ must be burning wood coated with tar. I'm going‘

‘ ~ “o'v,erto take a look.” i i ‘ .

« Dick entered the little patch of wood without
. 5.. . any particular caution, and walked up to the edge
or a small clearing‘. The sight that met his gaze
’ ftfairly staggered him for"a moment or two. ‘In the
. _ centre of the open space was a ﬁre, above which,
t.31'1gpepded 11;; gypsy fashion to three long poles,
». _  ‘ wasan old iron kettle. the contents of which Jim-
 my Sanders was stirring with a stick. A dis-
reputeble—looking pillow lay on the grass near it.
: Bound to a treegwithin aifew feet of the kettle,
 Dick was astonished to recognize Micky Grady.
‘ . Secured to another tree close by, with a handker- .
~ chief tied tightly about her mouth to stifle hei-
cries, was Pansy, looking-_very much frightened.
Dancing in a’ weird way in f ont ot Micky were
Packy Sanders and two of his cronies, evidently
ipyhigh glee. ‘- . c ,- V
M “Aﬁter we tar and feather yer we're goin’ to
. a ride. yer on a. rail,” said Packy, pausing in ‘his
 v-gyrations and addressirig the prisoner. . ' ‘
.  "‘You’re a lot of cowards,” replied Micky de-
 ﬁantly, (‘Why don’t you take 8. lfeller your own
28%?” , ‘

Packy scowled at the justice d then at Dick,
'M;icky and Pansy, while his mo er proceeded to
make a scene‘. Constable Green seizedbthe angry
' woman by the arm and bundled her out of the_
~‘oﬂ'ice into the street. Jimmy and Packy’s two
‘associates were then brought into the room by
the constable"s assistant. The result. of their ex-
amination was that Jimmy was sentenced’ to a
vn>.ek’s conﬁnement in the lock-up, and theother
'_.*wo were sent to the workhouse at Blackton for
‘ three months. That ended the proceedings before
the justice-, and Dick, Micky, Pansy, and the
spectators went their different ways, while the
prisoners were removed to the lock-up.

D ‘ ' CHAPTER VIII.—--Trouble Ahead.

'.The special meeting to consider lllﬂrtin _D1‘ake’S
case was called for Monday nigh_t. During the
afternoon Dicklfound an opportunity to tell Mur-
Jieray, the engineer, what he had overheard Drake
L say to Bill Sanders at the tavern on Saturday
jnight. . — ' _ _ v"

Kgating, and Haley, they’re all birds of a feather.

 

" prorwe anything in his own behalf.”
“‘Y,es,"answered Dick. _ __ __ '
,,“.I take that as 8. practical admission that his
ylcawev is a bad one. That being the case‘ he will
receive no support tonight from the soc_iety.”
 “Then the company and the superintendent

 “No. Sanders asked him about it,-but he said

‘ If .the/society threw him down then there would,
lied-something doing.” _ . p
‘ “I think the mattér looks serious enough for
you to call" at the superintendent’s office and ac-
quaintghim with what'you overheard,” said the
engineer.‘ ‘_

‘ Therewas ,a full house at the rooms of the Key-
 Blranch-rthat evening, as all the miners were
anxious. to learn whether the society was likely
tobe drawn. into an issue with the company.

ity, and were impressed by his plausible reason-
ing and logic. is _ .

The committee that had waited on the super-
intendent presented its report. This put the case
squarely up to Drake. He got up and made a.
speech in his own behalf, in which he exhausted
every argument he could think of. - Hi_s cronies ~.
followed, and strongly /urged the society to make
common cause with Drake. , ‘ ,

Then the sober and disinterested members came
to the fore and said that they failed to see one
good reason why the society should get into hot
water over Drake, as it seemed evident he had
been discharged for cause, which took the matter
entirely out of the hands of the union. , ’

The question was ﬁnally put to a vote, and ‘ ‘
Drake lost by a large margin. He sprang to his
feet in a rage. -

“I consider it an outrage to be turned down l- "

in this way after all the money I’ve paid. into
the society for protection. You desert me in my
hour of trouble like they say even the rats desert
a sinkin’ ship. All right, since I can't et justice ’
through my own society I’ll see whet er ,Il can
get it some other way,” he said signiﬁcantly. “I ,

kiss the hand of a bloated task—master, let me i
‘tell you that. Those who choose to humble them-
selves in order to keep in the good graces of the -
‘super can do it. ;,Taylor and his company. will
ﬁnd out before they are many hours older .that
they made a mistake in, refusing to take me back‘
to work. That’s all I've got to say.” '

His words created something of a sensation.‘
The members wonderedwhat he meant by saying‘

that since he couldn't get justice from the.socicty, 

he’d try and get it some other Way. Somebody _.I; ,
moved that the‘ meeting he adjourned, and in the.  ;
confusion that ensued Drake and several of his ’
closest friends disap eared. - «.
. Next“ day Martin rake’s family packed their
possessions into a ‘two—horse van and left the-
village, their destination presumably being Black-
ton. Drake himself left the key of the cottage .
at the company’s oﬁice with word that he gave up
possession voluntarily. . p , , ‘ ~

Sanders had been in a particularly ugly mood
since Monday night, when he learned that his, .
eldest son had'bee_n sent to the Blackton work-
house “for one’ year,_and his youngest to the
village jail for a week. He blamed their hard
luck: on Dick Darrell and Micky Grady, and regis-
tered a threat against them both. He did not
take the trouble to hunt u either of the boys to .
visit his anger on them, ut solaced himself by 
putting in more time at the tavern, «where he, 
Hissop, Haley and Keating met every night. and
talked a_nd_drank at a table apart from the rest‘,
of the habitues of the place. V ' 
, Dick, who visited the sick miner again that-»..'
week, saw them with their heads‘ together, and
wondered what they were talking about. _, The C ,_
boy had his suspicions that therepwas sometlfmg ;. '1
in the wind, but he was unable to catch is W03
theyfsaid,» so he had no mgans of ﬁndinggo
whether their conversation w s innocent. orrothe

' though, now that Packy and his associates were
_ being taken care of, they had no fear of walking
* into trouble. . . ,
After. supper Dick startedfor. the outskirts of
the village to visit one of his former associates
who was still looking after coal cars in the mine.
He spent a couple of ‘hours with his friend and
. then left for home. He was walking along a
retired and little frequented footpath, within 8.
‘ , few hundred yards of the Keystone Coal Mining
' Company’s office and other buildings used by the
corporation, when he heard voicesbehind him.
It was a calm, dark night, and the sounds came
"very clearly to his ears. The men who were talk-
ing were walking the same path behind him, and
were likely to, overtake him unless he walked
faster. This was a matter that would not have
l concerned him but for one thing—-the voice of
'- "one of the men sounded strangely like that of
Martin‘Drake, and Drake was not supposed to
'be .in the neighborhood any more. Drake had a
clear, bell-like voice, different from the tones of
any other miner of that village, and thatfact
. had given him great advantage as ,a public

 

speaker. V
; -‘.“If that isn’t Drake’s voice,” muttered Dick,
" “then some stranger has come to the village who
'_ talks just like him. If it is Drake I wonder what
he's doing here after severing his connection with
the place?” ' "
_, ‘ He soon heard Drake called by name, and that
settled. the question of his identity. Dick had
- little difficulty in recognizing'the man who spoke
‘to him by his voice. It was Bill Sanders. Dar-
-rel had no desire to meet either Sanders or Drake
~' ‘in that out-of-the-way spot at that time of night.
He judged that it wouldn’t‘b,e healthy for him.
There" were at least two other men with them,
. and the boy was at no loss to surmise who the
' other two were, for it was sure to be Hissop and
Keating, ‘or Haley. Dick was about to step out
pf briskly,1:for- the purpose of leaving the men as
. far ~_behind as possible, when the idea ﬂashed
. " .through his brain that the presence of Drake was
‘ rather significant of trouble.
’ _“I guess it’s my duty to try and ﬁnd out if
[these fellows are up to mischief,” hethought.
’»»“I’l1 just drop into'that shed yonder, wait till
 grey ‘pass and‘ then follow them. It’s my opinion
'» a-_t.Drake’s’ threat was no idle one after all.
"He and his pals may be making up some plan
, to, injure the company. If they are, I think it’s
\' up to me to lookafter the company’s interests.
/ That’s what I would expect of an honest employee
  Was‘ the owner of thisproperty/"
 ‘The men’s voices were gruff and aggressive,
‘ andgthe topic nder discussion seemed to be no
common one. Ks the men came closer Dick heard
_’ their words with some distinctness, and the pur-
‘, -port of the talk was clearly aimed against the
company, although he lost too many of the words
I.'.to b'e~jable to understand just what they were
talking about. ‘ . ,
. ,_Darrel had to leave the path to reach the shed,
a_ tithe ‘men were close- behind him when he did
so 'As’he crouchéd down in the open doorway,

V CHAPTER IX.-—The Unseenlwatcher. i

“What time will Keating join us?” asked Mar-
tin Drake. ‘ , _‘ a
“As soon as he kin ‘get away from his house,”,
replied Sanders. “I told you his wife is sick.”~ ‘ ‘
“Where did you tell him to meet 'us?.”_ . ' , '

“Why, that old soak, Ben Blossom,” said Keat-

 

replied Drake im-

mg. ,_ . . . ,
“Ben Blossom!” exclaimed Drake, Sanders and. *
Hissop in a.breath., V - ’

Dick's heart gave a bound against his ribs. 7 ~ V
Ben Blossom was the father of Myrtle and Pan-, «
sy. He was an inoffensive old man, who had gone . H
to the dogs since his wife's death, three years " .
since. While Mrs. Blossom was alive Ben was a. V 
sober and‘4steady miner, and stood high _in the" 1 '1

company’s books»; but when his wife died of quick» 
pneumonia he went all to pieces, like a stranded»
ship on a lee shore. . I g ,, ;
He took to drink, and became so unreliable that. "
he was ﬁnally laid off from work. Hewas told" V
that/if he would pull himself together and be a, 
man again he would be ateinstated, but he never, _
took advantage of the ﬁler. . ‘  W
His children were al owed to keep the cottage
at a reduced rent, which Dick helped to‘ pay by.
going there to live. ‘_ ’ ~
Although Ben Blossom-had no grouch against 
the company, lately his mind, weakened by drink, -.—
had become subject to hallucinations, and he’ _
imagined that the company was hounding him out ', A’
of the village. 3; ~ ’,
He began swearing that he would do something 3 u 
. Nobodypaid any attention to his '
vapor-ings, not even the superintendent, when his
remarks were reported at th oﬂice. _ ' ’ ,
That evening while watching beside his wife,
Keating had suddenly thought of Ben Blossom’: _
idle threats, and it occurred to him that they i
might be turned to theadvantage of -himself and;
his rascally associates in connection with the. '
scoundrelly job they contemplated putting into ex-' "
ecution that night.‘ , . _ . V 1 ' _/
He knew that Blossom on’ Sunday evenings ~ "
went to the cottage of an old mate. As, soon as he '
got away from attendance on his wife, —Kea.ting{

  

 
      
      
         
       
       
   
      
      
       
       
 
     
     

home. Keating had a ﬂask of whisky with himi 
and as soon as Blossom came along the rasca ’
hooked arms with him and oﬁered him the bottle,
telling him to drink heartily. Blossom ‘didn‘t re-'
quire a second invitation, and between drinki

and talking Keating decoyed him to a bunch,-of
bushes and kept him there till the old chap ﬁn;

  
 

  
 
    

drunken sleep. _ . . ‘ ;, p
Keating ‘then took his jacket from him and._
came right on to the shed where he expected to‘

     
     
   
 

— “Yes, Ben Blossom,” repeated Keating, as the
others looked at him. “_Here’s his jacket. I left ,
him as drunk as a loon -in a bunch of, bushes. not

The others thougt Drake’s suggestion good,
and the best thing; that could be done under the.
circumstances. Accordingly, Hissopand Keating

started for the village at a rapid pace’, making for ‘

the houseocjcupied by Constable Green,» where the
, rascals expected theboy would go first in order to
put the machinery of the law on their track.
Drake and Sanders hurried back to the oﬁice, un-

der the impression that Jobson had got into the’

-safe by that time and was watching for them with
, the money-box. On entering the oﬂice they found

that the crook had ﬁnished his work in good,
. shape, for the safe door had been blown open and .

the mon§y—box was missing. -Jobsori was also
missing, too, and though they looked all around
, - for him he was not to be found. . _
'1‘ _ , “Where in thunder is he?” asked Sanders with
., an imprecation. "
D “Blest if I can tell you,” replied Drake, scratch-'
[ his his head. “He‘ought to have waited here for
us. I guess he must have gone over to the shed
’,' where we arranged to divide the swag.” - O
_ , .‘‘Then,_come over to the shed at once. I, want to
. ’ see the color of that money.” _

Y . So they went to the shed at once. It was silent
and deserted, just as they had left it. There
Wasn't a sign of Jobson. Then the two rascals

I. looked. at each other. with rage and fear forming

, 1  in their minds. for the same thought had suddenly

/’ . occurred to each. ~ ‘

- Dickin the meanwhile kept on leisurelytoward

‘ the old farmhouse, where he saw a light "in two-

of the lower windows. The owner of the farm,
whose name was'Jason Clark, was something of.a-
lierinit, and lived there all by himself. It was said
that he had not a single relative in the world to

' flelave the property to, a property that might prove

immensely valuable i.n.,"co_al deposits. The chances

— 1 were. ther‘e-fore. that his death, unless he willed
' it tocharity, it would revert. tothe State.

Dick,
seeing the light in ‘the windows on the ground
ﬂoor. wondered if the old man got up so early in
the morning, for; he f'i,<:ui'ed that it must be about
three o’clock., He approached one of the windows

‘ i and looked into the plainly furnished sitting-1'0 Jm.

What he saw madehim gasp. The"o'ld ‘hermit
was bound to a ch-air in the centre of the room,

. =’and gagged with a hﬂllilkerchief, while over ‘in

one ‘of the'corii'ei's Martin‘ Drake was riﬂing an
writing-desk and

. _ §D_i'ck‘,‘ judging from what he‘ had heard Sanders_ .

Ifhe was not guilty of treachery toward his asso-

of age, andhad not a very long. lease on life. 
' He couldn’t praise Dick ‘too much to the can-» ~

pass over the railroad line to. Wilkes—Barre, tell-
ing him to report at the presicleiit’s office inthat
city next day. Thatevening Dick visited, Jason
Clark, according to his promise, and found the
hermit expecting‘ him. He told the old man the

‘story of his previous night’s and morning's ad-
ventures, and how it happened he came to be,

on the farm at the very moment when the recluse
stood most in need of help. They had a long
talk, during which the hermit assured Dick that
he would remember him when he came to die.
“All I ask in return, Dick,” he ‘said, “is that
you will visit-me twice a week if circumstances
will permit; You are the first person I've taken
a. fancy to in many years, and I feel certain that
,-y, deserve the good 0 inion Pve formed of you.”
'ick promised to cal on him regularly as pos-
sible, and then took his: leave. Next morning, be-

fore ,he went to Wilkes-Barre, Dick‘ appeared at,-
‘the examination of Drake and Sanders before’
a Justice Robinson. ‘

Dick told his story once more, and when he
had'finished there Wasn't an doubt among the

- ~ spectators as to the guilt of t e two men. They
- had nothing to say in their: own behalf and were

sent to the county jail at Blackton for trial.
Dick went to Wilkes-Barre and had a very satis-

‘ factory interview with the president of the com-

pany, who had him tell his story over again for
his beneﬁt andlthat of the directors who had

i been summoned to heariit. '.

A special meeting was convened and a resolu-
tion was introduced tendering Dick Darrell a

'vote of thanks for his conduct in saving the com-

pany’s money and catching Martin Drake, the
rascal. Dick was also voted a reward of
51,0 0 as an evidence‘ oﬁ the company’s apprecia-

3 ‘tion of his valuable services, and he carried the
, money back with him on the train as far as

Blackton, where he deposited it in a savings
‘bank. ‘Then the boy,‘ now a very popular per-
sonage in the village, went back to work in the

 engine-room,» just as if nothing out of the com-. w _

becoming vacant,‘ Dick secured it for old Ben
Blossom’ on his consenting to sign the pledge and
keep sober. Ben, who thought a whole lot of '
Dick, turned over a new leaf from the date of ‘
his appointment and kept_ his word to drink
no more. Three months passed during which ’
Dick visited Jason Clark with unfailing regit-»
larity. The old hermit became more and more
attached to the bright, sturdy boy who had saved
him from the ﬁendish torture that Martin Drake
had started to inﬂ.ic_t on_him ‘in order to ascer-
tain the secret of his alleged treasure chest.

One day Jason Clark sent to Blackton for the , .
lawyer who had drawn up his will in which he.»
had left everything he owned to various chaxi-' —
ties. The hermit ordered a. new will to be pre--‘.
pared in which he left his farm, as well 7 as all? 5
his personal property, and everything else’ of '.._
valuewhich he possessed, to, Dick Darrell, sub— ., 
ject to certain charitable bequests of an unim-
pprtant character. One evening when Dick, 
visited the old recluse he Was siirprised to see no 
light in the windows of the sitting-room. As‘ 7’.
the kitchen door, by which he always entered, was ,1
not secured, the boy had no trouble in getting in- v

CHAPTER XIV.-—(Continued)

Had he seen the murder committed? It began
to look so. Wi'll’s fear of the -man increased. He
would have run away then if the chance had of-
fered. He determined not to let another chance
slip; that he had rather face the consequences of
arrest /than to remain in the power of such a man.

But the doctor's answer to‘Detective Keene’s

roposition to come to terms gave, for’ the time

eing an altogether different turn to the affair.
. , “Come!” he exclaimed. “You are sharper than
 I thought for, Mr. Detective. I may as well ad-
’mit that you are right, and that I have the dia-

‘x

. me to make?” _ ‘
“My terms are simple,” replied Keene, with a
triumphant chuckle. “Turn them over to me, and I

“Of course, it is your intention to restore them

to Madame Sandnsky?” _ _
“Never mind what my intentions are in that
case. If you refuse my terms my intentions are
‘ to arrest you and turn you over to the police on a
 1 charge which will put you in such a deep hole that
 you will never get out again-‘see’!”,
7 “And you will leave me nothing?”
“Oh, you can keep a few of the smaller stones,
‘ if you wish.; I suppose you will have to have
something to pay you for yourjtroubleﬂjz

tor, rising. “Come wit me.” _

_ " “Wrong, again. My visit to Kutte_r’s old place

“I get there,” laughed the doctor. “It~is partly

have plenty of it, and it is partly fate, I like to
think. I was certainly fate which threw you into

no matter about his name—was‘ a crook clear
through, but a great coward. By the merest ac-
cident I found out what position he held in the
stores, and I put it up to him to help me get the
diamond, promising that he should have all the
rest of the stones if he would help mete get the
Great Ghorgee. He agreed to theplan, and ﬁxed .
it up with one of his associates at the stores, who

“ELECTRIC LIGHT”- BED ' 

An “electric lightj” bed has been constructed
and used by a Washington physician, who ‘claims
that it has given him better‘ general ‘health and
has apparently eliminated colds. - I L , '
An ordinary bed IS used, and above it is sus-
pended an inverted box about 7 feet’-long, 2 feet
wide and 2 feet deep. This box is slung on .Win:- T

ward the mattress.’ Inside thebox are eight .,to '
ten electric lights. When‘ retiringat nightjthe
doctor stretches’ out on the mattress, ‘nude, and
allows thelights to bathe his body.‘ A thermo-
stat, set by the sleeper before retiring, turns’ off
the lights when the heat warms the bed above
the set temperature, and turns them on when it
gets too cold. “A rheostat allows the sleeperxto.
turn the current to varying intensities. ‘ 
The arrangement is said to rest on thetheory
that in the earlier evolutionary period of man no
clothing was used. and sunlight constaiitly
warmed the skin and set the blood in motion-. .-

I had seen several of these beasts along the *

get a better view of him. He wasas handsome as

As we came bearer to him he gave a prolonged '
growl, as though he was not satisﬁed to-have us.

“Pull out your throttle,/man!" said my mate "3
sharply; and he "was evidently very much alarmed
at the presence of the tiger.

“I don't think he will care to meddle with the

ZOO; BUT ORDINARY HEN GETS JOB ;
OF HATCHING-CHICK. _ A
An egg worth $750, the second produced this ~
year, is the latest contribution of the California
condor, now a resident of the National Zoological
Park, under the Smithsonian Institution. The pre-
cious egg will be conﬁdedto the incubating care»
of a domestic hen’ in the hope that a_condor chick "‘ »
may be hatched; Whether an ordinary hen ican —

CANCER. STATISTICS

’ Encouraging statistics on cancer have come to
ii ht recently in a report issued by the New York
et-ropolitan Life Insurance Company. The in-
crease in cancer deaths has not been as rapid, the
_ report shows, as many crude statistics might in-
dicate. I
' ’ More accurate diagnosis, no doubt, has some-
‘ivthing to do with the increase or apparent increase,
.,as it has brought about the recording of cases
which a few years ago would not have been de-
tected. Another reason for the increases is the
lenghteniiig of the span of life, -cancer being
notoriously a disease of advanced age.
One of the most interesting points brought out
by Dr. Dublin and his coadjutors is that the in-

crease, such as it‘is, has been conﬁned almost en- .

tirely to males. ‘There has been little or no in-
crease among women, although ‘the death rate
from this disease has always een higher among
women. Another int is that the white race is
. ,more succeptible t an the colored. ‘
, . The report states that between the ages of
thirtgéteive and ﬁfty-ﬁve, it is probable that there
has I ii an actual decline in the percentage of
women who died from cancer, and no increase in
, the percentage of.meIi. This it is thought may
i be due in part to the campaign of education car-
ried on during e past decade, and to the num-
ber of lives saved or prolonged by early surgical
intervention.

 WHALE HIDE LEATHER

Newfoundland whaleizs, seized with aospirit of
 enterprising economy, are reported to be attempt-
; , ing to place whale hide on the market.for the
" : ainanufacture of whale leather.~ It is not.surpris-
ing that such an /attempt should be made. It
must vex the spirit of any Whaler of well-bal-
cgianced mind to  after all’ the hardship and dan-
-« » ger of his calling. an enormous and altogether dis-
T gproportionatesbulk of his quarry cast away. From
,a large rig t whale of, say, 45 to 50 feet in length,
about 250* arrels of oil and one and three-quarter
, tons of béleen, or whale-bone, may be obtained.
” - :The remainder of the gigantic carcass, which may
 bees much as ﬁfty tons, has hitherto been consid-
.» vered useless. The average whale hide if laid out
 fon the ground would cover a surface of nearly 1,-
’: 500 square feet, at which rate one whale, if its
hide could ‘he made into boots and Shoes, would fill

 

 

_‘. -9 testines of the whale will be made i_:emunei-‘ative.

NEW GAS FUEL WILL DRIVE SUPE}t-ZE'P- 
PELIN; DISCOVERY HAILED AS
NOTABLE STEP IN AVIATION

A newly discovered ga's,._mark_ing one {if
reatest advances In. aviation, will be used. for’
Auel instead of gasoline In Germany’s super-zep- ,

 

under the direction of Dr. Hugo Eckener..7 Not.
01113’ will this gas be algreat step in making 11 ‘ii;
safer, but it will enable longer ﬂightsean at'L
higher speed. \ T . .
The discovery, which was made by Doctor Lem-
pertz, a chemist on the staff of the Ze};p)elin'
W01'kS. has been thoroughly tested in Ma aclxu
motors similar to those on the Los Angeles. Only.-
a slight alteration in motors is necessary to fit?‘
them for using the new fuel. ~ g ‘
One cubic metre. of the new gas develops 25 -;
per cent. more power than a ki.logram,of gasoline
according to tests and it is less expensive than
gasoline, since by doing awa with the weight of
_ _ _ eeping the shi_ al-'
ways at the same weight It is unnecessary to ‘bl ‘
off large quantities of hydro en in order to com
pensate for the loss,of weight through fuel con
sumption. Since compensation for loss of weight»
is unnecessary when using the new gas it willin; 2 ’
crease the average Speed of the ship, and sine
hydrogen ‘gas cells do not need frequent‘ﬁlliiig 
will permit landings to be made anywhere.’ “  .-.
With the changed construction of the Ze’pelin .
it will be possible to carry almost double’ the
amount _of fuel_ in gas form than could be taken
in gasoline. , Since there is no waste in iﬁflati ‘
gas it would make the.-.use_‘of helium precticgi,
from a ﬁnancial standpoint.  ’
The new ‘airship is designed to contain 105,000
cubic metres, which is‘ 50 per cent. more than the
Lo_s_Angeles. Like the ~Ainericanf ship it? will 
equipped with ﬁve Maybach motors, develo ingl,
420 horsepower each. Also‘ the new craft wi be ‘
considerably longer but’ less in circumfyerenceqi. -
The su er-Zeppelin, which will bear the ‘factbfyzi
name. «L -127, will. be ‘completed’ by the Autumn,“
of 1927, according to Doctor Eckener. ~ -‘ ' I t
The money for starting the constructionof this.
craft was raised from popular subscriptioiiﬁaii ’
it is to be‘ used for Dolar and oth_ei- expeditions. .
’ Now that restrictions on Germany’s buildin -as
Zeppelins have been raised, it is believed ‘gin
construction can be begun on types suitabiefior;
passenger and freight service for great-distancf
and that this one will be the ﬁrst of a» big ﬂeet.
