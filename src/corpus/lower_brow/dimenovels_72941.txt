) “Why didn’t you come the moment I rang for
~ you?” roared Ichabod Bates, Curb broker, as he
glowered at his bright, cheerful-looking ofﬁce boy
gpand messenger, Fred Muncie by name, who had
"just bounced into the private oﬂice in answer to
'_the summons. “Were you taking a bath or hav-
ng your hair curled?” he added sarcastically.
. “No, sir; I was_ in the wash-room.”
: “What were you doing in the wash-room?” de-
nianderl the broker, his well-trimmed side-whis-
lters standing outfrom his cheeks like the quills
’ iofa fretful porcupine.
“Brushing my hair.” '
- . ‘'‘‘How many times a day do you consider it
 necessary to brush‘. your hair?/"’

Every broker who knew Fred, his_emiil‘b'yer ex-
cepted, said he was the smartest and most intelli-
gent-looking boy in Wall Street, and "what so
many people said must have been pretty near the.

truth. He helped to support a widowed mother‘

and a younger brother and sister, and he did it
cheerfully, as if it was the greatest pleasure in
the world for him to do so, notwithstanding that

he was thereby deprived of many pleasures other

boys had. The little family lived in a four-room~

flat in Harlem. and were as happy and contented
as’ any family could be under their straitened
circumstances. When Fred reached the corner of
Broad Street and Exchange Place he saw a crowd
around a street fakir. He stopped a moment to
see what the attraction was. The man was sell-

ing mechanical mice, which he wound up with a,

key and then set down on the sidewalk to show
how much thev acted like live ones. Fred thought

of the fun one of them would afford his pet white‘

cat at home. Accordingly he bought one, tried
it on the walk and then put it in his pocket. Two
minutes later he was riding up in the elevator
to. the ﬁfth ﬂoor of the Mills Building. In an-
other minute he walked into Bowker’s office’. He

‘ had been there before. and he knew the red-headed

office boy well. . ,

“Hello, Muncie; what do you want?" asked
Bowker’s boy, whose name was Peter McGuin-
ness. and who had a coarse, freckled face in addi-
tion to his ‘ﬁery red hair.

“I want lots of things]? rinned Fred. “Tojbe- —
‘gin with, I've got a note or

Mr. Bowker.” -.

“Give it to me and I'll take it in to him,” said
McGuinness.« T

“I will if he gives me one.” _ ,

“My orderssare to fetch one back, so you'd bet-
ter get it.” ‘

“Who gave on the right to order me about?”
growled thego ce boy.  T . =
“Nobody. It’s just my ‘way. Get a move on,

I’ve got just six minutes, and ‘thirty-nine
seconds to get back to the oﬂice.” - "
“Aw! What are you givin’ me?"

Fred turned his back on the lad and walked ‘V 
There were‘ several
customers in the room standing around the tlckar ‘

over to one of the windows.

A ‘cuspidor stood between the windows. Fred
-.happened _to glance at it and saw, lying between
it and the wall, a fat-looking wallet. He walked
over and looked down at it to make sure his eyes
had not deceived him, then he picked. it up. He
stopped to the windowand was about to open it

when McGuinness came‘ up to him and handed him

an envelope. . » ,
“There's your answer,” he»said. ,“Now /you can
sneak.” " , : » s .. 
._ Fred slipped the wallet into his pocket and
left the office. While waiting for the %levator
, cage to come down. he took it out and opened it.
He found it full of papers and money—'~.the lat-
ter in big, yellow-backed bills. ’ ’
“Looks as if there was all of a thousand dollars
~ here,” he said to himself. “I wonder who it be-
‘ longs to?” _ , . ~
',” ’ He started to examine the papers when the cage
stopped at the ﬂoor for him, and he hastily closed
the ,wal.let»_and put it in his pocket again. When

Babes. The broker tore the , envelope open,
, glanced at the fewwords scribbled in lead pencil-
, I on 'a small-sheet torn from a pad, and grunted.
' [Fred took the grunt as a signal to retire, and ac-
; ’ cordingly he walked outside to his seat in a small
:1 enclosure furnished with a_ ticker, spittoons and
several chairs. There was nobody in the place.

took a train down to Sixty-seventh Street ‘and
made his way to Mr. Lake’s house. A maid an-

swered to his ring and he was shown into the par- '

101', and in a few minutes a ﬁne-looking man made
his appearance. . ’

“Mr. George Lake?” asked 'Fred interroga-
tively. _

‘‘That’s my name.” V;

“Did you lose a pocketbook today?” -

“I did,” said the gentleman promptly and wit"

considerable eagerness. “Did you find it?”

“I found a wallet which I think ‘belongs to you. , I

Will you tell me as near as you can remember
what was in it?”

“There was $1,250 in money in it, for one thing,‘ .

and a number of apers.” V

"That's right. t’s yours, I guess," and Fred
produced the wallet. - ' _

Mr. Lake said the pocketbook was his. .

“You are an honest boy to return it with al
that money in it,” he said, regarding the_ young
messenger boy very favorably. “Where did you
ﬁnd it?” .

“Behind a cuspidor in Broker Bowker’s office in
the Mills Building.” _ -

“I was there this morning, but I thought I lost
it on the street. I advertised it in two news-
papers, but had some doubts about recovering it.”

“Examine it, sirfand see if everything is in it,”
said Fred. V .

“I have no doubt everything is in it,” replied
Mr. Lake. ’

He took the money out, and counting $250-I"

handed the bills to the boy. ,
‘,‘Permit me to repay you for the trouble you

_ have-taken in bringing it back to me,” he said.

‘_‘I’m afraid you are giving me a great deal more

than I deserve, sir,” said Fred, regarding his lib-1

eral reward doubtfully. ‘ .
“Not at all. Honesty under such ‘circumstances

is a scarce commodity in this world, and is‘ en-.

titled to recognition. You might easily have kept
all the money and g'ot‘1-id of the pocketbook down

“I am messenger. for Ichabod Bates, a Curb
broker at No. —-— Wall Street.”

Mr. Lake made a note of Fred’s name and ad-
dress. After some further talk the boy took his
leave and wefitrhoihe. He had shown his mother
the pocketbook with all the money in it and told
her he hoped to get a ten-dollar bill foz1,returning

it. When he got home his mother was sewing in _
the ,dininp:-room and his brother and sister were '»

studying their next day’s lessons. 
“How much do you suppose the gentleman gave

which was more money than she had handled" for
a long time, that she offered no objection to Fred
using the balance. SQ next‘ day he took the money

and, going to a little banking and brokerage house‘

in Nassau Street, he put it up as margin on 20
shares of S. V& T., at 69. He had long wanted to
try his luck in the market, but had been pre-
vented by lack of money. Now he felt that he

had. found in Mr. Lake's pocketbook. He watched
the ticker after that with a strong personal in-
terest, and was pleased to note that S. & T. began
- to rise gradually. On Saturday noon it stood at
72, and he went home feeling particularly happy.
During thejfollowing week it gvent to 82. .Then
on the succeeding Monday it b gan to boom and
jumped to 90. At that ﬁgure Fred went to the
‘bank and told the margin clerk to sell his stock.
,The_shar;-3 were sold in a few minutes at 92 3-8.
and he made [a proﬁt .of $420. He told his mother
about his good luck and handed her $100.

“I’ll keep the $500 so as tohave it handy in

case I see another chance to make a haul. There
are always opportunities turning up in Wall
Street, mother. and I want to be ready.to_take

" Vadvantage of one when it comes my way..” __

 A few days afterward..Mr. Bates sent him up-
stairs to the public stenograplier’s oﬂice to tell
Misssmith to send Miss Stringer down to take
some dictation. After getting out of the elevator
on the tenth floor he passed two brokers along
the. corridor. .

“Yes,” said one of them in Fred’s hearing, “the

I Judd clique is engi eering 9. corner in A. & B.

‘I)aytoi;, -.Iudd's bro er, is buying every share

.That is all Fred heard, but it was enough to
‘set him thinking. _When he was sent out that
afternoon "he made some inquiries that convinced
him’ A. & B. was a good stock to own about that
time, so on his way home he went into the little

bank and ‘ordered 50‘ shares of the stock to be ‘

bought "at the prevailing ‘price, which was 52.

just come in from an errand and was reapdingxa

rumors that were aﬂoat concerning the consolida-
tion of the W. & C. branch, railroad withthe D.

the envelope and took out ,a sheet of note-paper it
on which there was some writing in lead pencil.
It ran as follows: » . . c _

, “Fred: I have just ﬁnished typewriting a ’ f
lengthy agreementbetween the D. S: G. Railroad,‘ c , ‘«
as party of the ﬁrst part, and the W. 8: C. _"Rail- ' "

onlookers. Fred sat up in a dazed way, not quite
certain about what had happened to him. In a
moment he ws surrounded with a circle of grin-
ning faces. Among them was St. John, the dude
insurance clerk. ,._'_He recognized Fred, and the
boy’s mishap ﬁlled his soul with unexpected joy.

“Serves the little beggar right, ’pon me word.”
he remarked in a loud tone.

Fred heard the voice and recognized the speak-
er. His hand also came in contact with the moist
banana peel. Springing to his feet he jumped on

‘the dude and washed his face with the inside of
the skin before the young man knew- what was
going to happen. .

“Take that, you lobster!” cried Fred.‘

Then he ﬂung the skin in the sputtering and
demo'ra.lized' cle k’s face, and slipped out of the
crowd, leaving e dude to take his place as the
laughing-stock of the crowd.

When the Exchange closed that day, W. & C.
was ruling at 60, and some of the lioarded shares
had begunto get into,circulation. Fred decided

. that it was safe to hold on to his shares, as the
boom in W. & C. was no ephemeral one, but built
on a solid foundation.

The afternoon papers published the particulars
of the consolidation agreement and Fred read the
story over carefully in order to inform himself

‘UNDER A LUCKY STAR

concerning the advantages that had accrued to the .

W. &. C. stockholders. The papers said that the
stock might go to 80 before many days.
Two days later Fred sold out his 700 shares
at 78 3-4 and pocketed a proﬁt of $25,000. As
.soon as he‘ col ected his» money he put 10 per
cent. of it, or $2,500, into an envelope, and
‘waited downtown till five o’clock, when Hattie
Stringer was through for the day. He went up
to the tenth floor to meet her, and as soon as
she came out of her oﬂice with several of the
other girls he called her aside. ,
“Hattie, do you remember that tip "you sent
me about the consolidation of the W. & C. with
the D. & G1?” ' "
'“Oh, yes. You said you thought you could
make‘ something out of it, but as you haven’t
mentioned the matter since, I forgot all about it.”
“Well, I did make something out of it——a

mighty good thing, though I’ve had to wait a’

month, nearly,
through.” »
"‘I'm glad it proved useful to you,’ Fred,” she

' replied.» '

for the consolidation to go

“It proved so useful to me that I am going to .

give youa share of my pro-ﬁts. I .think.that is
only the fair thing.”_ _ ‘ .
“I never. refuse anything that carries my way,”
lau hed the girl: i
“ hat’s right. You’re a sensible girl. I’ve
put the money in an envelope and addressed it
to you. Open it and see how much it is.’f U .
- Hattie did so, full of curiosity and anticipation.

By» the time Mr. atesiﬁnished speaking Fred

understood that the messages carried by himself ‘

rushed up to him and said: .
“Here, have you got my note? I've just dis-
covered that I have yours.” . or 0
“Give it to me,” said the other boy witha look

of great relief, at the same time thrusting the‘

envelope he had into Fred's hand.

“Did he ask you if I’d seen his note?” asked-

the broker.

“No, sir. He seemed mighty‘ glad to’ get his

note back,’ and he didn’t stop to say anything on it

the , subject.”

“Good!” chuckled the broker,

Fred, as he walked back to the oﬂice, guessed
that there must have been something in Attle.-'

a bury in connection with’a certain deal, and no-; 
body ever knew, but Mr. Bates himself, that the , ~
notes put several thousand’ ' —

dollars in his pocket.

A few days after this incident~Fred learned V“
that a syndicate had been formed to boom M. 8;’

his information was the real goods he went to

A sharp advance all along the line started an»

excitement that increased as the -hours went by,
and for a while the rise in M. &‘N. escaped gen—
With the ending of the day's
business it had gone up ten points, and Fred
went home feeling that he was about $30,000
richer than when he got up that morning. The
r1¢Iext&d§y the whole market boomed again. and

called attention to the rise of ﬁfteen points in

«two days in M. & N., and on the following morn-

ing this stock became the center of interest.
Crowds of perspiring traders surged around
the pole all day long bidding and buying, and
acting like lunatics as the price went up to 85.
Two or three times that day Fred tried to
reach the little bank to order his shares sold,
but something always interfered, and the Ex-
change ﬁnally closed in a state of seething ex-
citement with M. & N. roosting at 90. On his
way home he stopped at the bank and ordered

"the clerk to sell him out ﬁrst thing in the morning
when the Exchange opened for business. He was’

never so nervous before, for he now had a for-
tune at stake, and if anything happened to upset
values before ten o'clock next morning, the

0 greater’ art of his proﬁts now in sight might

Hissleep that night was troubled by all sorts
of uncanny dreams that seemed» to carry dire
misfortune in their train. Morning ‘came at last,
and he felt very much like a chap who had been

5 on a “bat” the night before. When he reached the
oﬂice he looked about as usual, though his eyes -

shonewith suppressed eagerness and excitement.
At ten o'clock, when the Exchange opened, he was
on the street with a message to a broker in the
Mills Building.’ He was back at the office by
quarter-past ten, and the first thing he did was
M. & N. was quoted at 94.

* “My shares ought to. be sold by this time. At
any rate, Whether they are or not, all is well with

the market so*far, and I don't see that I have any «

i call to worry.”

At eleven o'clock Fred was sent to the Ex-

' . change with a note for Mr. Dusenberry, and found

the ﬂoor in a seething tumult of excitement.
A clique of bears had just jumped on M. & N.,

i. ' which had reached 98, and was‘ raising merry
~ Cain with _it. In a few minutes it dropped to 94.

It would probably have recovered» but for the

A , fact that a panicky feeling seized upon the mass
- -oi brokers interested in the fortunes ‘of M. & N.,
" and they all rushed with one -accord to sell out.

This pulled the scales down‘ in favor of the

movement started by the bears, and, soon the

panic became general. The syndicate's ‘brokers

for he could not tell for sure where he stood. If

and were holding their heads‘ up, owing to their;

, Accordingly onthe following day at half-past

large oﬂice building, where Mr. Lake, who was a

 tenth ﬂoor. When he entered the ‘outer oﬁice, or

Fred knew little about the 0. & P. line except
that it was a comparatively unimportant road,
and as such, its securities were at a discount on
the market. ' ,

Mr. Lake soon returned and Fred forgot about
the lease during the conversation that ensued.
After he had taken his leave the matter recurred
to him. , , ’

“Thatlease ought to be a goodthing for the

‘O. & P. stockholders,” thought the boy ,reﬂective- .

ly, as he walked over to the Third Avenue ele-
vated, which was the most convenient line for
him to take to reach his mother's new home in
the Bronx. “Seems to me it will cause the value
of the road’s securities to rise. I must look into

more satisﬁed he became that he had accidentally
secured a ﬁne tip, and he determined to. make C
the most he could, out of it. ~ '

“Itis the fellows who get hold of -inside infor-
mation who make the money nowadays,” he told
himself. “A man who knows beforehand what’s

ing to happen’ plays with ‘loaded dice in,the

all. Street game of chance. Every time‘ I've
operated on a tip I’ve won out. This looks like
another, and a good one at that.” . ' .

Next day Fred looked up the O. & P. road in ’
the office copy of the “Railroad Manual.” He
also consulted the value of its stock for the past
ten years in the “Annual Register.” The 0. &
P. shares were selling now at 39, and were not
sought after apparently, if the volume of busi-
ness done in its securities could be considered‘ an
indication“o_f’ the ‘fact. ' ’

‘That’ afternoon Fred called at the little bank

‘ and left an order for the purchase of -10,00C

shares of 0. & P. Owing to the value of the
stock the bank accepted the order on a margin
of $50,000,‘ the same to cover a possible fall of
ten oints. Next day Fred left an order with a
regu ar brokerage ﬁrm for 5,000 shares more of
the same stock, on a margin of $25,000.
both instances the shares were secured and Fred
notiﬁed of the fact.

_A few days lateran unusual volume of business

‘in 0. & P. raised the price to 40. _Next day the

stock went to 41 on account of the demand for
it, and many brokers began to wonder what: was
on the vtapis in that road. The call for shares"
continuing, speculative traders began buying it,

3 and the price went to 42. ‘ After a while it was r
noticed that the demand was greater than the ‘

supply, and of course, that boomed it higher.
Rumors and speculations concerning the road
began circulating through Wall Streetybut so

In 

quietly had the deal with the P. & R. system A’ ‘

been worked that no one guessedthe truth.

Every time Fred returned from an errand he
looked at_,_the ticker—tape—'to see if there were any
fresh quotations in O. _& P.’ Mr. Bates, coming V
out of his private room, noticed hiinporing «over, '
the tape. , l -I . . ,; H

“Don’t let me hear’ of you doing ‘anything -like

Mr. Bates, darkly. ’ " ' * .

F “Id don’t believe in bucket-shops, sir,” answered
re . ‘ -

“I’m glad to hear that.. The wholesystem is
a swindle on the public.”

. O. & P.. continued to attract notice, and quite
a little business was done in it at the Exchange.
_ Finally ‘shrewd traders noticed that, it washard

. to ﬁnd and they surmised a possible corner in
. the shares.

The price gradually worked up to
50, but'not even the newspaper men could ﬁnd
out the reason for~the advance.

One morning, however, ‘the news was given,

out oﬁicially that the O. & P. had been leased to
the P. & R., and then the cat was out of the bag.
—A rush wasmade to get _the stock, but by this
. time the insiders had captured the bulk of it, and
_ little left for the ordinary specu-
later. The price was run up to 60 in a few hours.
' Fred decided that he'd cash in at that ﬁgure,
and he ordered his block of 75,000 sold first in
/lots; of 1,000; It was greedily snapped up by
speculators at 60 1-8, yielding Fred 9. proﬁt of
$103,000. —He thenngot rid of his 10,000 .lot
‘through the little bank at an average of 60 3-8,-
which gave him a proﬁt of $210,000.

' -“Gee!” muttered Fred. “Talk about luck!
Over $300,000 roﬁt in one‘ deal. Why, if this
sort of thing eeps up I'll be worth a million
before I'm legally able to vote._ I'll bet there

i are scores of brokers down here who aren't worth

half as much as I am now. I’d be willin to
bet somethin that Mr. Bates is one of it em.
a Wall Street messenger ‘being
worth more than his boss!” - _
Fred chuckled at the thought of such a thing,
and also at the idea of the scene that would take
lace in the oﬁice if Mr. Bates by -any, chance
earned that his office boy had made over $400,000

: out of the market through lucky speculations.

The result was that when the dude clerk and the
sport parted that night, the former began to
seriously consider Doble’s suggestion» of taking
$200 of, the oﬂice cash, covering‘ up the matter
by a false entry until circumstances enabled him
to make the embezzlement good. ,

. CHAPTER X.——Fred Makes a Surprising Dis-

covery. .

St. John, whose first name was Clarence, ap-

, 0 ‘propriated the $200 next day, and thus stood
i ‘ Bud Doble oﬁ'.. For a week or two he walked

,. around on pins and needles for fear the manager

might discover the matter and ﬁre him. The

0 ' . manager, however, had full confidence in the dude

-

cashier, and nothing happened. V
This immunity from exposure encouraged St.
John to take $100 more for his own use, and, the

‘ ice thus being broken, he continued to appropri-

ate small sums from time to time until his defa1-
cations amounted to_. nearly $1,000. By that time
the clerk andthe sport were on closer‘ terms than
ever. St. John ﬁnally conﬁded to Doble the par-
ticulars of his enmity against Fred Muncie, and
his strong desire to ' get square on, the young:
messenger.

The dude clerk ascertained that the boy was

going‘ to take Hattie Stringer to the theater on ,

a certain’ night and cominunicated the fact to

waylay Fred on his way from Hattie’s house to
the nearest elevated station after he brought the
young lady home from the theater. They in-,
tended to knock, him out‘ and rob him of his
watchand money, so as to make it appear to be
the Work of common thugs. The watch and money
were to go to the sport, while the clerk would
be satisﬁed with the revenge thus obtained-on
the boy he hated. * ' ., .
“A Doble and St. John, somewhat dis-
§u' ised, lay for Fred on the night in uestlon. He

shot. They then dragged the boy into one of the

i  houses and proceeded to leisurely riﬂe his pockets.

St. John did not suppose that Fred would have

‘_ _much astonished when the sport ‘pulled a wad

passed on to the platform. Then he called the
station agent’s attention to them and asked_the
man to take special note of’ them, as he might
be called upon to identify them later on.

He -then made a note of the hour and a few
other particulars, and called the agent’s atten-
tion to that fact, too. He took both the agent's
name and number and then walked downstairs,
crossed the street and mounted the_stairs of the
opposite station, where he caught a northbound
train which took him home. -

Next mornin he told allthe facts to,Mr. Bates.
The broker tol him to consult the police at once,
and excused him from duty long enough to‘ do so. ,

The captain of the station told him to call on

.,,iFred told the gentleman of that part of the
conversation he had overheard between St. John
and his companion relating to the cashier's ad-
mission of having abstracted money at various
times from the cash-drawer and covered the em-
bezzlement up by false entries.

“Now, Mr. Wilbur, you-have heard my story,
and you can accept ‘it for what ’ ou think it is

worth. , I deemed it my duty to te 1 you that you .
may take action to convince yourself by a critical’

examination of your cashier’s' books whether my
statements are really founded on fact. Before
calling on you I related my story to Mr. Bates,
and it was on his advice that I came up to see
you, and my employer accompanied me to assure
you that he considers any statement I may make
perfectly reliable.” '

Thus spoke Fred, and his frank and honest
manner convinced Mr. Wilbur that he had told

_ the truth as far as it had come underhis obser-
.vation. He thanked Fred and Mr. mtes for
advising him as to. the presumed condition of
things, and told them he would look into the
matter at once. Inside of an .hour an expert
accountant was going over St. John’s books,‘ and
it was not long before he found evidence of
crookedness on the part of the cashier. In the

' meantime the detective took the dude clerk to the
Tombs and caused him to be locked up in a cell.
In a little while he and another detective, visited
him and subjected him to a species of third de-
gree examination. He told St. John that he had

1-9‘ _a'witness to show that he and his companion had

.; ‘called at the Third Avenue‘ station shortly after
the crime was committed andtaken a train down-
town. i -

"Now, we want to‘ know the identity of. this

- man who was with you last night. If you re-
fuse to tell us we shall take a» means to ﬁnd. out,
and then it will go harder with you. If you make
a clean confession of the matterthe judge will
deal leniently with you, as it is your first of-
fense.” ‘ _ ‘
- The attitude adopted by the detectives was to
impress the fact on St. John that they had no
doubt of his guilt, and that they would have no
difficulty in proving it when the case came to
trial. The result was the unfortunate cashier,
being a coward at heart, weakened and confessed
giving Bud Doble away as his associate, and tell-
ing the detectives that Fred Muncie’s watchwas
concealed in his trunﬁ at his boarding-house. Two
hours later the Tend rloin sport was arrested in
a Sixth Avenue saloon and brought down to the
Tombs. He was cool and collected, and denied

held next morning in the Tombs Police Court.
Fredtold his story. The station agent told what
he ‘was called on for, and the twoﬂdetectives
testified to the confession made to them by St.
John. The cashier pleaded guilty and asked for
mercy. But Doble regarded him with contempt

Both were held fort e

turned an indictment on which Doble was tried

CHAPTER XII.—Fred Leaves the Employ of _ 3
‘ . Mr.Bates.  i. _ Q *'
All of four months had passed away since Fred * '
made his big winning in O. & P., and during that
time the boy's $400,000, lay idle in his safe de-
posit box. No chance offered that Fred co_nsid- 
ered safe enoughto risk his "money on-,: and“noi: "
even the ghost of a tip came his way. While the .
young messen 1' had his thoughts centered ‘on 
acquiring a mlllion. he was more cautious than 
ever for he knewhow easily fortunes were lost ‘_
in all Street through an unlucky. turnof .F'or- '.
tune’s wheel. Several ‘of his particular friends‘
had been promoted, and he ran against them no ‘;
more on the street. That fact, together with the . r
possession of a capital larger even than.h'is‘boss
could raise, began to urge him to shake the *
messenger business and hire a little oiiice_for 
himself which he could make his headquarters.  

  

While he was ﬁguring on the matter he .dis‘- 
covered, through a conversation he accidentally» 
overheard in an oiiice he visited with a note, that H
a powerful syndicate had been formed to comer '
H. & H. shares, and boom the price, The syn-_

messenger when you came in?”

“That's right. I am Mr. Ichabod Bates’ mes-
senger.”

“Then you are buying this-stock for Mr. Bates,
is that it?” V .

“No, sir; I’m buying it for myself.”

“You mean you wish the deal recorded in your

~ name, perhaps?”

'‘‘Of course, as it’s my deal.”

'__Tlie broker smiled again, as if he thought he
understood what the boy was, in his opinion, try-
ing to conceal. He did not for a second believe
that anyniessenger boy was worth $100,000. He
was satisﬁed that'Bro'ker Bates was behind Fred.
Picking u the money he counted it, and ﬁnding
it all rig t he made a inemeorandum of the
transaction, signed it and handed it to Muncie.

“I supposeyou understand that it will be nec-
. essary for you to-come here personally to sell this
’ stock. We do not recognize any one else but you
in it.” < ' ‘ ‘
 “’That’ is right, sir. . Why should you recognize
. anybody else when it is my deal?”. ' .
‘ g,‘ Very true; why should I?” smiled’ the broker‘
as Fred got up and bowed himself out. ,
; Fred shortly afterward visited another brok-

_ ‘erage house and left an order fora third 10,000

hares, and had a similar “experience with the
head of the ﬁrm, who did not believe that the boy
was buying such an amount of stock for himself.
Fred did not ‘care what these brokers thought as
long as they took his order in legal shape,‘ and
thereby made themselves responsible to him for
  the shares. On the following day, he dropped
, .into the little bank and asked the clerk if his’

' order had been filled. ' _

“I_’ve thrown up my position as messenger with

‘ “You haven’t?” she cried incredulously.

Mechanically Mr. Bates did as Fred directed
him to do.-

“Now put on your hat and go.

The broker seized his hat and rushed from his
office with the package of money in his hands. In
twenty.min.utes he was back, "but "he was as
Weak as a limp rag and lookedilike a man who
was hypnotized. Fred was waiting for him. He . _
sat down at his desk and looked at the -boy for 5
some moments without speaking. ‘ .

“Where did you get that money?” he asked at
length.

“I made it in the market.” ,

“You——didl” replied Mr. Bates incredulously.

“Yes, sir, I did, and aslot more, too.”

“Either you're crazy or .1 am,” replied the
broker. ,

“I am sure I'm not crazy, and I don't believe

ing the last year and a half. ~
“I had some first-class tips, sure'winn,ers in . -
their way, and they practically‘ did the business ‘ ‘I
for me. I have just got out of this M. & H. ﬁ ht
over $300,000 ahead. I found out that a‘ ig
clique had been formed to corner It, and ,I.se-
cured 30,000 shares at 81, 92 and 93. I sold one
lot at 96 1—2,lanother at 98, and the. third I. un-
loaded an hour ago at the market. As the price
has held atg91 Iahave calculated my ﬁnal"proﬁt_e=

"You are a wonder, Muncie,” said the broker. _ . ”
“ ou have saved me from ruin, and saved my life’
well. I shall never forget what I owe you." , -. 
“That is all right, Mr. Bates. It is a good thing‘
to do unto others as you, would have others do
unto you in a pinch." , ‘ _ 
“I will make out my note, Muncie, but I haven't 1.: =
any security to offer you with it.” -  w  ’
“Never mind the security. I'll take your word.
I am sure you will pay up when you are in the
position to do so.”
"I surely will, as Heaven is my judge,” replied
the broker solemnly. 5 ~
He drew up the note and handed it to Fred. E:
Fred then got up to take his leave, and Mr. 
Bates followe him to the corridor door in a way  "
that-was almost obsequious. An hour later 
& H. suddenlywent to pieces and involve the
whole Exchange in a big i-panic. C. & B. was car- ~
ried down to 99 in the general slump, and Fred 
telephoned Mr. Bates that he could have another
$100,000 if he needed it. The stock, however, re-
cover€d'to 102, and so it wasn’t necessary for
more money for the pres- -
ent. A week later v.,& B. went u to -118, and
Mr. Bates sold out, makin about 30,000 proﬁt;

he didn’t' torget the great debt that he was under

 "I'd like to know who started this yarn about

what Fred conﬁded to him. Then the boy called
{on thecashier ofthe ‘little bank in Nassau Street

leaked out." The cashier said he would investigate
,,the._matter, ‘but; he did not believe that any em-
, ployee had opened hismouth about the bank’s

business. It was contrary to. all precedent,.and
’ would lead to the offender’s instant discharge if

{a ‘letter from the bank_ which stated that, so far

Attlebury’s messenger boy, however, was put on r
the stand and under oath admitted that heajhad
shown Mrs. Leslie into his boss’ private room ,0
at least two occasions. The jury, after "hearing -
all the evidence, brdizght in a verdict of guilty..
Attlebury then had the case appealed, and he and
Coddington got out on bail. Eventually both were
sent to Sing Sing, and that ruined their standing
in Wall Street forever. ' ,

On the day they were sent up the river Fred got
a pointer on a syndicate that was about to corner » p, .
T. & D. shares. He got in on the ground ﬂoor to the
extent of 12,000 shares, which netted him a proﬁt
of something over $200,000. That made him ,
worth a clear million in cash- Then he hired a. I V,

started out as a regular broker, hirin an elderl

CHAPTER XVI. V
' Will Runs Up Against Madame Sandusky. _

Then his own‘ was demanded. _ , ,. ' _
Will gavethe name of Rumbeio. It was, with
the exception of “Mr. Bum’s” cognomen, the only
Hindu name he‘ had ever heard.
“Take him to the hospital,” he said.» “He is not
_  dead, I am sure. He will tell you where to ﬁnd
 " «his friends when he comes to.” ..
' The oﬁicers ‘pressed Will hard for further in-
formation, but he stubbornly refused to give it,

for he felt that whatever he told was almost cer-‘

tain to be turned against himself. _
So Doctor PaJaro was rounded up 111 the New

York hospital with a broken leg, two ribs crushed .

in and other internal injuries.
' , He was at once recognized by the house surgeon,
‘ . who had met him in medical circles. -

By. this time the doctor had regained conscious-
ness. 'While the examination was being made he
never so much as uttered a groan. »

He seemed to realize his condition, however, and
when the examination was completed, he remarked
to the doctor in charge that he woul “probably
» die." - -'

I The dpctor shrugged his shoulders.

‘remain in the room during; the ex’amina'tion,.and
was starlding quietly at the head of" the bed then.
The house doctor motioned to him to step .for-
- ward, and Doctor Pajaro took his hands, speaking
- a, few words in Hindustani, withthe evident in-
‘tention of making the doctors believe that he was
a Hindu like himself. j ; V
 .wi11 was much moved by the pathetic look the
- sufferer gave him, and /tears ﬁlled. his eyes.
’. “Leave me alone with my_cousin,. gentlemen,”
said Docrtor Pajaro, “Just for a few moments. ‘I
have several things to say. Ishall be real . for
“the operating tab e as soon as you are, an you
_.needx‘not ‘fear that I shall make you any trouble."
'. His iwishes were ‘complied with. ’
~ <As Will‘ learned later on, Doctor Jajaro held

— that alone was sufficient to command the respect
of the rrfedicalfraternity. ‘ .

It was truly wonderful to witness the aﬁection
and reverence with which he regarded this glit-

“Take .it, Will," he then said, handing the dia— _ 1, 1

I want to get you into further trouble, but there is '
still work for you to do with this stone. You

It was a sad parting. e , _

Will was more affected than he”, could have be-.
lieved possible. - ‘ ’ ’

As the doctor wasmost earnest, that he should
at once take the diamond’ to the -address which
he scrawled on a leaf of his memorandum _
upon which he also wrote a few ﬂy-tracks, which ’
must have been Hindustani, Will did not wait”bo-

These thoughts were cliasiiig each other

There were no chairs in the room, but instead

“It is very strange that Doctor Pajaro should
have sent him here to see Swami. Don’t you '
think so, Madame Devora?” the prima donna ‘
asked. » _ , _ ' I

reply. “When you as ed me to hypnotize him 1

“And have Swami come in and catch me at it?
I should not dare. If Swami was to come’ his
rage would be terrible. You do not suppose that .
the \,boy has the diamond upon him?” -«

"No, no! That is impossible. I know that he

that is faked is found to have less sparkle than a ‘

the stone is genuine, the drop of water keeps. its _ 5

, AA DEATH TRAP

When Mattie Carnes became Mrs. Brady, or in
other words, my ‘wife, we boarded for several
years with the Widow Graywood. She was one
of the best women I ever knew’. Her husband had
been an engineer on our road, and_one _of my best
friends; indeed, I obtained my situation by his
aid and inﬂuence.

A few weeks after my marriage John Gray-

wood died of pneumonia and not by the perils of
the craft. He had a wife and three children. He
owned,’-free and clear, the small house, with half
an acre of land, in which he lived at the time of

_, his death. Beyond _this_he had no property, and-
when he was gone his widow was perplexed to de-

termine how she should obtain the means of sub-
sistence for herelf and children. I had been so
intimate with‘John Graywood that she called on
me for advice. — _ ~ -
I saw that she had a ‘very comfortable and
pleasant room which she did not need, and _she
was glad to take me as a boarder, with my wife,
especially as she knew Mattie was ,a gentle little
woman. The widow's only son was _a lad of six-
teen and I obtained a place for him in the village
at a salary which made the mother’s income, with
what-I paid for board, suﬂicient for her needs.
Susan Graywood, the older of the two daugh-
ters, was twenty, and a very pretty and intelli-
gent girl. She had been through the high school

and at the time of which I write was seeking a
situation as a teacher; though as yet there was
little prospect of her obtaining one. .

. ‘.While things we e in this not u_npromising con-
dition Peter Wilkhart put in an appearance at
the‘ house. He was a man _of about thirty, and
kept a store at Galtburg, a Junction. on our road.
He was reputed to be worth some money, though

his character would not bear investigation, and it

was said that he had taken to drinking rather too

V  ireely for his own interests.

John Graywood had known Wilkhart for man

I d had had some money transactions wi ,
years’ an borrowed six hundred .

him. The engineer ‘had _ .
dollars of the storekeeper. He remained his
debtor for something like three years, but the
debt was paid only three weeks before the death
of John Graywood. The latter _had ‘borrowed the
money for the purpose of assisting his father,

 h h d fallen into some ﬁnancial trouble‘
‘ 71?‘),-amore than a year Wilkhart had pressed

Graywood for ayment, but the_ engineer had not
been ‘ le to r ise the money without mortgaging
his litt e estate, and his father had assured him

This business had several times_ called the
atorekeeper to the home of the engineer, where
he hadmet Susan Graywood. She was very pretty

, ‘as well as very accompliShed,_ and after he héid
made his first visit it was plain enough that his _
, object was not so much to collect hisldebt as to

see the daughter of his debtor. He could have

I" seenthe father at the junction every day and

there was no longer any excuse for the_store-
‘keeper to visit the home of John Graywood, but
Itil he I T

° .,Susanc?il!dehot like El-iimtand kept at a respectful
"tance froinhim. He asked for Susan everx

time, but she was pretty sure to be visiting a,
neighbor or attending an afternoon meeting. It

did not take a great while for Wilkhart to see

that she purposely avoided him. It made him
very angry when he realized the fact and he be-
gan to resort to strategy to gain his purpose. V

27,

I ran down to Grovelawn at night and returned ’ I

in the morning, so that I was at home during a
part of the afternoon. Wilkhart came up on my
train when he made his visits, and generally I
found him at the house when I went home. ,
“Not here?” said I, as I entered the little par-

lor where the ‘family s ent the afternoon. -‘I ‘

looked at Susie and laug ed as I spoke, for I had’
been inclined to joke and banter with her in re-
gard to her. devoted but unwelcome lover.

“Who?” she said, smiling and blushing, and I
am afraid I bothered her for the sake of seeing
her blush-—-she did it so prettily. .

“Peter _Wilkhart. He was on the up-train this
morning and I expected to ﬁnd him here as
usual," I replied. -

“Then he will certainly be here!" exclaimed
Susie, laying aside her work and leaving the
room. ,

I understood her purpose and I did not blame
her, for Peter Wilkliart had nothing like delis
cacy and gentleness in his composition and he
wooed a maiden ashe traded horses. In a mo-
mentmore I saw Susie leave the house. ‘ I

The little home was located on the outskirts of

the town, and there was a considerable grove be- ’,

tween it and the .north village, as the smaller of
the two was called. I sat at the window of the
parlor and saw her till she disap ared behind
the pines. I began to, talk with rs. Graywood ,
about the matter. She asked me more particu-
larly than ever before in regard to the character

of Wilkhart. I expressedmy o inion with entire —

freedom, for I believed the fel ow was.a rascal, I

I independently of his drinking habits. I1."wae‘not‘

rum that made him a bad man, but he took to ruin
because he was bad. I ~ ’ I

While we were talking aboutithe situation and
trying to devise some means to get rid of the per-

‘ sistent lover forever I heard a scream.in the

grove.

“That's Susie!”‘the mother exclaimed." “The

fellow has been waiting for her in the grove!”
Inha moment I was in the
ered Susie and Wilkliart standi g in the road.

“What’s the matter, Susie?” I asked as I came 

to the spot where they stood.

‘£lN}othilngk is the matter,” answered Wilkhart,
an e 00 ed very ug .
yourself about my aﬂ"aii~s.”

“I didn’t speak to you, sir,” I added,» turning 

to Susie for her ex lanation of the diﬂiculty.
“I met Mr. Wil art just here, and because I

refused to stop and talk with him he tookholdyof  

my arm and held me,” replied Susie, struggling
with her emotions. « ’

“Don’t. be alarmed, Susie. If ou want to go 
ed, glancing at I ’

anywherenow you can go," I a

‘ her assailant.‘

She had hardly_ started on her return whenher

mother and Mattie came running into the grove,‘
I told them what had hap ened and my wife’ and i

Susie walked back to the curse. Mrs. -Graywood
gave the rascal a piece of her mind andforbade
liiiii ever to come to her house or to speak to her’.

where on the road when he had the money to pay
you,‘ and, as you had not the note with you, you
gave him a receipt for _the money, which con-
tained your promise tp give up the note.”

“Show me the reecipt, then.” ’ _

We looked the house over ii-om cellar to garret,
 but no receipt was to be found. It was not in the
house, I was sure. ' . ..

EGYPTIAN HOSPITALITI ’ ‘

in honesty, courage and the manlier virtues«';~yet ' .. .
in hospitality and politeness he stands p-re—emi-'.,
nen_t. ,No Egyptian sits down to a meal without‘  —

In spite of all that has been soid~to the "contrary,
there is less immorality among the Egyptians...
than among Europeans. To show the direction in‘
which ideas on.mari-iageiare setting, we may ‘state -
that one of‘ the first teachers in .Mohammedaii-

‘law in Egypt some time ago laid down this
maxim, that the Prophet had allowed four wives ~v

"to any man who would engage all four alike, but '1
as he had never met anyone capable of doing so, 
he would recommend one wife as the interpreta-
tion -. of the Prophet's words. Indeed,.the rela-
tions of. the first wife so resent a man’s marry;

RADIO DETECTS NERVE CURRENT

. The electric current that shoots along a nerve:
ﬁbre has been detected by_ means of a three-tube?-
~D. Adrian
of Cambridge University. , I ‘

It had long been known, he said, that the pass- 
ing of messages down a nerve caused an electrical _
disturbance. But it had only been possible to
record the effects from a large number of fibres
at once, for example, the thousands of fibres from V ,
an eye, or to a muscle. The results obtained were_ 
therefore as confused as would be the‘super,-im- ‘

 

tween London and Manchester. Doctor Adrianls _
new apparatus, says Science Mgazine, makesit ,
possible for‘ the first time to obtainrecords in. a ,
rapidly movingphotographic plate of the impulses ’
passingalong a single ﬁbre. E

In conjunction with ‘Doctor Zottermann, a _Nor- --
wegian neurologist, Doctor Adrian recorded. the  ‘S
results _of stimulating a sense organ’ connected to
the brain ‘by a single ﬁbre. The sense organs in '
the skin‘ which give information as to touch, 
and temperature, are too near together for this to
be easy. Those in the muscles subserving the so-’

   
   
  
   
   
    
  
 
 

c called muscular sense are farthenapart, and ;by]; 

stretching a i?ro_g"s muscle it was found possible»
to stimulate a single, one. The impulses wereall, .
of the same size, but as the muscle. was stretched

their frequency was increased from ten to ﬁfty;

transmitted through the nerves as~diﬂ"erences of ’
rhythm. ». , " ' \ .. ,

MEASURING HAT HEAT

During a heat wave in Paris recently a group

‘ of scientists held an investigation to ﬁnd out how

hot hats were. The experiments were made at a

temperature of 97 degrees Fahrenheit. The sport-

ing cap was found to be hottest of all, with a heat

beneath it of 98.6 degrees. The derby was next

at 92 degres. Felt hats showed only 86 degrees

and the stiff straw '79 degrees. The panama won

over all with only 77 degrees--20 degreescooler
under the hat than outside.’

_Three ‘more volcanos have been, added to the
map of American territory, and two of the new
craters rank with the giants among the ﬁre-» .
mountains of the; world. The newly map d vol-~,

between ‘the Bei-in Sea and the Paciﬁc Ocean."
This strip of Ian , which contains more active
and extinct volcanoes than all the rest of North

One of the mountains is 6,000 feet high, with a
crater five miles across. It shows signs of havi ‘ ‘

ARTIFICIAL TIMBER

‘  }Nﬁ less’ than'60 per cent. of atree is.wasted_ in

' its conversion into lumber. At present- the twigs,
branches, bark, roots. sawdust and plank and log
 u5trimmi'ng:s are entirely lost. A new process for
 the utilization of tthese waste products and the
production of synthetic lumber is being .tried out
"in the United States. The process is a conver-
. 1 sion of the waste into. a cellulose compound of a
“plastic nature that can be pressed or moulded

'3 into all conceivable shapes and bulks from boards

0 ‘ to rafters.

The development of the process -haspassed be-I

‘ lyond théinitial experimental stages and has been
7.,taken in hand by the National Lumber’Manufac-
“tare;-s’ Association. If it is commercially prac-
: ticable it may be extremely valuable asa step to

THE “AMERICAN TYPE”

An American type of man is developin .' In
the older American stock this 1'. e has a ready '
reached a point where it is possib e, without much’ 
difference, to distinguish it from the peoples of I 
other countries. This is the conclusion of Dr.“
Ales Hrdlicka, anthropologist of the Smithsonian , ,; 3,
Institutie of Washington, D. C., upon many.» a
years of scientiﬁc measurements and study of _
those whom he ‘designates as ‘‘Old‘ Americans,” - -
and Iff the immiigran-ts differing from the original
stoc .. » . .

"The work, as now completed,” says‘ Dr. ’ - 
Hrdlicka, “shows that the older stock has. ap-, . "
proached the formation of a distinct American A '
type. his type is still ‘nearest to that of its main
progenitors, the British, but in stature, in physi—
ognomy, and in behavior, it is already more or
‘less«ndifferent-American. The type is a good ,
one. . . J .
_ Hre is Dr. Hrdlicka’s description of the,Am‘er‘- *
ican type of man, so far as it has been developed‘: 1

“It is characterized by tall stature, being the ff
tallest of all the larger groups of white peoplezﬂ » V.
by, on the average, a medium pigmentation of the
p of adult blonds and near-ab- .»
y -prevalently mixed eyes, or‘
light ones showing, more or less of a brown admix-

main characteristics o itsbehavior are, in gen-.7
eral, franlmess,...opennessyet shrewdness, ener

and persistence, with, in general but little senti-{

tremes except perhaps in industrial, ﬁnancial‘ and
occasionally in religious endeavors. ~~  

“This type,.*contrai-y to‘rccei:t~ unscientiﬁc be?»
