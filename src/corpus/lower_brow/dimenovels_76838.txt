Questions were asked about Mr. Taylor’s habits.
Itwas learned that when he had work to do in the

office at night he always locked himself in.

There was a watchman, of course, employed to

make the rounds of the factory buildings.

He was now asleep, but a messenger was sent for

him in a hurry.

The watchman was found at his home, aroused and

taken to the factory ofﬁce.

“I made the rounds just as-usual,” he said. “Mr.

Taylor came down to the ofﬁce about eight o'clock.

“I saw him when he went in and spoke to him.”
"Was he alone?” asked the policeman.
“What did you say to him ?"

“Nothing more than ‘good-evening, sir.’ ”

“Did he reply?”

“Yes.” _

“VVhat did he say?”

“ ‘Good-evening, James,’ said he, and went in.”
“Was that all?”

“Yes, sir.”

“How long was he at work?”

The watchman gave a glance at the body that had

been laid uponvthe ﬂoor.

“Good Lord!” he gasped, “how can I tell? Ain’t

he here now ?"

“Yes, butyou didn’t see him go away?”
“Certainly, not.” — ‘
“Well, then, how long was the light burning in

this ofﬁce? You could see it, couldn’t you?”

_“I could. ,  saw it eveiy time I made the rounds.”
f‘Well, at whathours did you pass the oﬁce ?”
“A few minutes after every hour. I make my start

A policeman was sent to examine the windows
along the street side. i , 4
He reported that none had been tampered with.
The front door, too,7was all right.
“Then,” said the ofﬁcer, “Mr. Taylor let the mur-
derer in himself.” ‘
“That’s almost impossible,” responded the di~
rector.
V“Why~?" t
“Because, to get in, the caller would have to ring
a bell or knock very loudly. His knocks probably C
would have been heard by the watchman, and his T
ring certainly would, for at night the bell is connect-
ed with gongs all over the factory buildings.”.
“Very well,” said .tl1e,ofﬁcer,e. “the man got in with

“Is that all?” '

“All that reminds me? yes. I can't help wonder-

The great detective paused and did not ﬁnish what
he was going to say.

“I see what’s in your mind,” said Chick. “Dick
Taylor got away. You are wondering if he has
shown up again in this crime,"

“That’s it. We know that his people were rich,
and that his father is dead. And that's about all we
do know about him except‘ that he's a crook, and
not a very smart one at that."

“He may be smarterthan you think,” suggested
Chick.

“Sure.”

“He’s smart enough to get away,” said Patsy. i»

“That’s right. too, and I would like to get‘ him
just for the satisfaction of locking him up, but I
thought‘ he was hardly worth a chase because he had
nothing really to do with the grave~robbing. case,
and because we've locked up the men who really
did the crooked business in the swindlingUopera-

promise. _

Then he would go all to pieces and his paper would
get left.

Nick had met him on a good many important crim-
inal cases, and liked him, as did everybody. '

Besides that, there had been times when Billy was
really useful to the detective. V

Any information he had got on his own hook he
was always willing to give up to Nick, and in’ return
Nick always gave him a good story when he could.

The detective had also found that Billy could keep
a secret. If Nick said, “I’1l tell you this, but I don't
want you to print it till I say so,” he could be sure
that Billy would keep mum. ' V ‘

“Never mind,” the man said, “I’ve got a bottie
of good stuﬁ in my room.”

He opened a stateroom door and both went in.

Nick was troubled.

\Vas this an old friend of Billy's, or was it a chance
acquaintance picked up in the barroom of the boat?"

It didn't look right. '

The detective went along the hall and paused by

the door of the room they had entered.

He heard Billy’s voice. The reporter was laugh-
ing, and the other man apparently was ﬁlling a
glass.

"It’s no business of mine." thought Nick. “If
Billy gets drunk that's his affair. I don’t mean to
make a fool of myself by interfering."

But the detectivedid not go away.

He remained near the door, listening, and feel-
ing more anxious every minute.

He was not trying to hear the conversation.

It would have been impossible if he had, for the
voices were low and he could hear no words.

Before long the murmur of voices ceased.

Billy, probably, had taken just one drop too much
and had fallen asleep.

Nick felt desperate.

“I may be mistaken," he said to himself, “but,I'm
going to >t_ake'theAchance.” _

i \Vith'no further hesitation, he drew back as far as
the narrow passage would permit and made a charge
against the stateroom door.

‘ He stooped and brought his shoulder against it
near the lock. _

All his giant strength was exerted, for he did not
want to have to make a second charge. ‘

That was not necessary. ,

The bolt tore away the lock and the door swung
inward, carrying the detective half across the lit-
tle room. ' , B

“No. You thought last night that I was, but I

Billy looked around.

“I see," he said; “rm still on the boat. Is it late

He leaned his head on his hands and groaned.

whom he had run across in t.wo previous cases. '

The very man of whom Nick had thought when he
first read of the Fall River murder mystery. '

Taylor looked very solemn when he came in.

He glanced inquiringly at Nick, who had taken a
chair by a window and was apparently reading a
newspaper,‘and then spoke to the chief:

“You hardly remember me, I suppose," he said.

“\Vell,” replied the chief. "it's» some years since
I saw you, and we were never well acquainted,
but I remember who you are. You’ve been away .1
long time,’ Mr. Taylor."

“Yes," the young man responded sadly, “I had to
sow my wild oats——like a fool !" l.e added. with great
bitterness.

“How long have you been back ?"

“I arrived only this morning. I went straight to
my uncle's house and heard the awful news there.”

His voice trembled. and he pressed his~handker~
chief hard to hislips. .

“You hadn’t heard of it !" exclaimed the chief.

“No; I was traveling—on my way from Chicago.-

“Mr. Richard Taylor," added the superintendent,
“will probably take hold of the work here at the
mills, as it was his uncle's wish that he should do so.”

“Will he take his uncle's place?” asked a man
from Boston. 7

"Not at present." was the reply. "He hasn‘t had
experience enough for that."

“\Vhat will he do, then ?"

“Go into the factory as one of my assistants and
learn the business thoroughly."

Nothing was said about Dick's shady past.

Nick quietly talked of that matter with the Fall
River reporters. They told him much the same that
the chief of police had done, that little had been
known of Dick since he ran away from home years
before. -

“He hit a pretty hot pace,” said the reporters, “but
his father left him quite a lot of money just the same.
It is supposed that he went through that, and some
people say he has been crooked, but nobody knows.
I guess the worst he ever did was to gamble pretty
freely."

Nick knew a good deal about Dick's gambling,
but, of course, he kept his information to himself.

At this time, that is when the reporters were get-
ting their information, Dick was in the mill office
with the directors. I

Most of the reporters went away before noon, but
a--few remained; and-among them was Nick Carter.

He was waiting to get a sight of Dick.

A loud whistle blew and the rattling of the ma-
chinery in the big granite buildings died away.

The doors opened. and hundreds of employees ‘

came trooping out on their way to dinner.

They passed through the little gate near the office.

Superintendent Jackson stood in_ the office door~
way. .

Before the first of the employees passed out, Dick
came from inside the office, and stood by the su-.
perintendent. ‘

Nick and the reporters were a few feet distant.

It had leaked out that a boss named Gleason was
under suspicion.

‘Some of the reporters had heard the fact, and they
were the ones who remained. A

_,fI‘hey‘vganted to get a sight of Gleason, and they
hope<t‘t‘hat' he would be“arr;ested on leaving" the rail}.

The latter had come in but a minute ahead. of
Nick.
He was talking with the clerk. who, it seemed, had
been a friend of his years before.

Of course. they were talking about the murder,
and Dick was as solemn and sorry as when he talked
with the chief of police.

The newspaper men, too. were talking of the mur-
der. ‘ V

Their work was done, but they were not at‘ all
agreed as to the solution of the mystery.

Some were sure that Gleason was guiltty.

Others pointed out the probable fact that the mur-
derer had let himself into the ofﬁce—building with a
key. ‘

"Gleason couldn't have had :1 key," they said.

“\\’ell_." suggested one, “Mr. Taylor might have
forgotten to close the door. If it was unlocked,
what was to prevent (ileason from walking in ?”

"He is the only one who has been shown to have
a motive for the crime," said another.

So’they argued, and Nick pretended to examine a
railroad time-table for a moment, to listen. 7

Presently, one of the reporters laughed.

“The fact is, boys,” said he, when they turned in—
‘quiringly to him, “we fellows are probably in the
soup as far as this case is concerned.”

“What do you mean?” they asked. _

“It's too good to keep,” he answered," ‘_‘and, any-

Then she saw what he had taken from the shed.

It was a short, light ladder.

He placed one end on the ground and the other
softly against the house wall.

The top end rested on Ida's window sill.

"Well, well I" thought the brave girl. “I’m going
to have a caller so soon. I wonder who is doing me
such an honor?"

She did not stir from her place, but she took out
her revolver and was ready for what might happen.

The man climbed the ladder.

As his head came le\'el’witl1 the window sill she
saw that he was heavily masked. '

Ida let him come up two rungs further.

Then. when one hand had been laid on the sill of
her window, she grasped it ﬁrmly.

\Vith her other hand she pressed the cold muzzle
of the revolver against his forehead.

“Excuse me," said she, in a cool, low tone, “but
haven't you come to the wrong room ?" -

The man started, but made no sound, except that
his breath came in gasps.

Evidently he was trying to see who she was, and it
was equally evident that he was horribly alarmed.

For a second or two he was too paralyzed to stir.

Then he tried to jerk,away his hand. ,

Ida held on grimly.

“You; might at least tell me your name, or leave
your card,” she remarked.
to you."

He muttered a ﬁerce oath, and suddenly kicked the
ladder from under him.

Asit tell, his whole weight came upon the hand
that Ida held, and it was, of course, too much for her.

stumble a bit after‘ reaching the ground, and then
dart into the alley. V

25

In about twenty minutes the lights were put out,
and she started for home.

As she was passing the oﬂice door, it opened, and
one man came out, and again it was Richard Taylor
she saw.

He saw her this time, and he grasped her savagely
by the arm.

“Girl!” he hissed in her ear, "never say you sa\
me here! If you do, I will kill you.” -

Mary was terribly frightened. She feared not
only for herself, but for her lover.

So she said nothing. not even when at last her
lover was accused. Knowing him to be innocent,
she hoped that the truth would come out without her
telling it.

\Vhen Dick heard this story, he broke down and
made a long confession. The letter that he had
shown the police was not written by David Taylor.

Dick had written it himself, and had cleverly drawn
imitations of postmarks to show that the letter had
been received in Chicago on the night of the murder.

He had got into the building with a key that he
had made secretly years before when his father was
alive. He had always kept that key, thinking some
day that he might rob the safe in the office.

On the night of the murder he had walked in and
found his uncle with his will in front of him. He was
looking it over. intending. as he told Dick. to have
his lawyer change it on the following day so as to
cut off his wicked nephew.

The murder followed almost instantly.

That night Dick walked to New Bedford. and
staid there till his appearance before the chieffof
police.

It was Dick, too, who had tried to climb into Ida’s
room.

He thought it was Mary’s room, making a mistake
of one window in the darkness. \

It was his plan to murder Mary, for he feared he
could not keep her silent.

His confession cleared away all the mystery of the
case. but it did not save him from the penalty of his
crime. _

He was executed on the gallows tlpree months
later. _

After the arrest Nick went to the Wilbur House
and called on Billy.Dingley.

Theygcgorter had just waked up and read the de-
tective's note. ‘

He was awfully ashamed of himself. and, for a long
time afterward, was not known to drink a drop.

THE END.

Next, week’s issue (No. 279) will contain: “Nick
Carter and the Kidnaped Heiress; or, The Recovery
of a Great Ransom.” The Carters were kept busy.
Theii next case, which was a strange one, took them

The American yelled back, and the two men scuﬁied
and fought on the platform until another member of the
party came out, and asked what was the trouble.

“I'm keeping this tramp from stealing a ride!” ex-
claimed the American.

“Nonsensel" said his friend. “You're ﬁghting with

The American vowed that he would never again judge

Not the Defendant.

_ (By H. C. Jones.)

I was a witness in a law suit and the lawyer for the
defense had got a continuation of the case till the next
day. The judge told the bailiff to bring in the prisoner,
Mr. Johnson, who was accused of stealing chickens.
The lawyer for the complainant had tried every way to
get him to confess.

Finally the judge said:

‘ ‘?I believe you are the defendant in this case, are you
not ”

The old negro looked at him and said:

“No, sahl Ah’s nufﬁn ob de kin’. Ah’s no such a
ﬁns. Ah pays a lawyers over dot to look after ma de-
fense.) Ah’s deﬁgemmen wat stole de chickunis.'f

Dear Sir: I tried my hand at amateurcletective work
recently, and I think that I was fairly successful.

In the story of*"Nick Carter's Ocean Chase." I had

‘decided before I had read very far that Palog was the

guilt)‘ man. 

He confessed himself a thief when he told how he
had stolen the diamond from the poor savages in Borneo.

If he was wicked enough to steal from them, ‘certainly
he was wicked enough to steal from his own govern-

Then his aecounfof his discovery of the loss of the
diamond looked to me a trumped-up story. a
