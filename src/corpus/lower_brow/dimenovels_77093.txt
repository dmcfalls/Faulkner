her gratitude. Then, perhaps, she’ll take me into her conﬁ-
) dence.” » '
It is clear from the translation of this cipher letter
that Ida was in the Dover street boarding—house for
the purpose of watching the beautiful Laura Dash.
5 The circumstances that led to" setting a watch upon
Miss Dash may be stated brieﬂy.
15 _ Patsy had captured a desperate murderer named
I Stetson. The murderer had escaped from a deputy
sheriff who was taking him to jail. He was aided
in his escape by a Salem dentist named Mason.

In the course of an attempt to trace‘ Stetson’s
movements, Patsy had been captured and nearly
killed by Mason and other criminals in the gang, but

\ Chick, who had taken a hand in the case succeeded in
capturing alhof the crowd, except Stetson himself,
who was still at large. - ,
Then Nick,°seeing-that Stetson was a criminal of
 unusual cleverness and daring, decided to put all four
‘ If of the detectives, himself included, into the work of
running him down.
,‘ j The dentist, Mason, had made a partial confession,
M in which he had made it known that Stetson was in
love with a girl named Laura Dash.

:  Dash, for, from what had happened previously,
the detectives believed_that,Stetson might be bold
 to call 'on her. . j . . l ,
While shejwas performing her part of the work, the
men’ weré‘scattered'about the country north of Bos-
iton--one in Salem, one around Stetson’s former
\ lifanie near Newburyport,‘ and another following up
'.clews that  toward Concord. ‘ V
, “Well,” said Ida,‘ suddenly, “I511 do it. Show me
I . the way to your uncle’s.’’ \ g C
* “I’ll get ready at once,” replied Laura.

Ida, therefore, was detailed to get acquainted with

NICK CARTER wI:éKLv. 3

“I've half changed my mind," said Laura, as they

’ start'ed toward \Vashington street.

“What do you mean? You still need money, don’t
you ?”

“Oh! I’ve got to have it‘, but there are other ways,
besides hocking a watch. I guess you can think of
some, can’t you?”

“Yes, indeed,” replied Ida, quickly.

She had led Laura to suppose that she had been
discharged from a store for robbing the money-
drawer, and that she had‘ been mixed up in other

crooked transactions.

“I was thinking,” continued Laura, “that it would
be too bad for you to go without your watch, even for
a few days, if there should be any other way of rais-

ing boodle. I might find a pocketbook on the side-
walk, you know."

“Certainly.”

“Well, you’ve got enough for car fares.

They took a ca‘, and when it was passing Jordan &
Marsh's big store,-"1 .aura said:

Let's go

“VVe will go in here. They are advertising some
lovely things that I might like to get.”

For some minutes they wandered around in the
store, without stopping at any of the counters.

Laura spoke from time to time about the goods

she saw. “I like that,” she would say, or, “That

might go very well with my blue waist.”

Ida replied in the same way.

The store was crowded. Finally, they pushed into
a jam by a counter and Laura“ went to examining the
articles for sale there. ' I _l

“I don’t see just what I want,” she said, at last, and
turned away.

Ida, watching all the time, saw that slie had hidden
a small roll of valuable silk beneath her jacket.

They went to another counter where real lace was
on sale. ‘

A goodjmany dollars’ worth of the stuff could be «

coveredlby one hand.

“and will make up the amount now, we will say noth-

Laura stamped her foot, and wasabout to make

I shall see that the store suffers for it.”

Laura took the cue at once, and marched out, won-
dering how her new friend would manage to avoid
exposure, and fearing that shewould not succeed.

Obeying the detectives order, Ida went into the
private room with the woman.

There she took off her long cloak and shook it, and
the woman felt of it carefully. ‘

For several minutes the woman searched, and Ida
said not a word. She did everything she was told to
do, and at last the woman drew a long breath.

“There's evidently been some mistake,” she said.

She called in the detective. '

Ida was, of course, fully dressed, except that her
cloak lay on a table. I

‘ She was seated in a chair beside it.

“Mr. Henderson," said the woman, “I am afraid
you’ll have to apologize humbly.”

“I will if I have to,” he answered. “Haven’t you
found anything 2"

“Not a thing." A

“Then I apologize, but! cannot understand it, for,
while I have  waiting, I have had reports from
two counters. A small roll of silk is missing from
one, and a valuable piece of lace from the other. I
was positive that I saw one of these young women
take them.” .

H.. VV"hite, where they continued their ‘talk in the
ladies’ parlor;

“I pinched a box of bonbons in that place at the
corner,” said Laura; “have some?" I 4
She held out the box. It was already half empty,
for, having stolen it from the counter, she had calmly

stood there eating the candy, in plain View of the

- saleswomen.

This was a little too much for Ida. She felt com-
pelled to help the beautiful criminal out of her shop-
lifting scrape, but she di.dn’t_like the idea of receiv-
ing stolen goods, -even when they were no more
valuable than candy.

“No, thank you,” she answered, “I hate candy.”
“»That’: a shame. These are awfully good. But,
tell me, how did you do it?”

Ida opened her cloak.

“See anything?” she asked.

“No.” '

“Neither did they, but look!”

With a quick motion, she drew the three articles
from the c'oncealed pocket. ‘I ' A

Laura’s eyes bulged with surprise. '

“You had them all the time?” she asked.

"Yes.” I

“VVhat!”

“Have they paid their bill?”

“No.”

“You've seen the last of them."

“Are you sure ?”

“Will they comeback here to be arrested? They
know that I am a detective.”

“Oh, my? oh, my l” groaned the landlady. “The
shame of it! To think of having criminals in my
house! and they owing three weeks’ board, too, for
I haven’t had a cent from them since Mr. Dash came
to board with his daugliter.”

“Ah 2” thought Ida, “if I had known that Mr. Dash
had been here so short 3 time I might have suspected
who he was earlier.”

But she said aloud that it would be better to say
nothing to the other boarders or anybody else about
the matter. -

Mrs. Billings declared that she was too ashamed
of the whole affair to mention it to a soul, and Ida
said that she would leave the house the next day.

At that the "landlady begged her to stay as long as
she wanted to, and Ida answered that she could not
tell how long her business would keep her in Boston,
or where it would take her next.

Ida then went to her room. Her telegram to A
-Nick had been very short, and she now wrote a long

report of what had happened, and mailed it in a
street box near by. .

It was then bedtime, and she lay down, but she
could not sleep. She was greatly troubled by the
thought that the criminals had slipped from her
grasp.

As is matter of fact, Ids was somewhat ashamed
of herself, although she‘ had no reason lot‘ being so.

“I ought to succeed in doing something in this
case,” she said to herself. “I've had one chance
and 19% it. What can'I do?”

Suddenly she thought of the fence. '

“Did you come back so -as'to give me a dew, and
let me try again?”

“I did not! I shall leave the house as quietly as-
I entered it, and when I go you will stay l1ere—4-
dead!” ‘

‘(I See.” .

It need not be said that Ida perceived the girl's
deadly purpose from the start, and she regretted that
lier cloak lay across a chair on the further side of
the room. '

In it was one of her revolvers and a pair of brace—
letsthat would have looked mighty well just then I
on Miss Dash’s wrists. ‘

The detective could notget at her weapon with-
out passing Laura.‘ V. I

“She’1l spring at me," thought Ida, “anl
sooner it’s over the better." ‘

Accordingly, when she spoke the last time, the de-
tective made what seemed to be a careless move-
ment.’ ’

Instantly the beautiful criminal leaped.

She unfolded her arms, and a gleaming dagger
flashed in her right hand.

Ida caught her descending hand and tried the trick
.Nick Carter had taught her of wrenching the dagger
away. _ _ s
For once it failed.’ ‘ . .. A 
Laura Dash knew that trick, and a laugh hissed
from her lips as she saw that ’the detective, though
avoiding the first blow, had not succeeded in what; ’
she tried to do. V V
The only thing that Ida could do then was to,
grapplewith her foe, and she did so.
Almost silently they strained at each other. ' pg 
The criminal had the strength and fury of a tigress.

could not overcome her. i

Of course Ida could have aroused them by

Laura stooped quicker than Ida, and caught up
both dagger and revolver.

She was panting from the struggle, and her face
was as red as ﬁre.

“All right,” she gasped, “if I can't make the knife

. do its work, I’ll risk the consequences and use this."

She raised the revolver, cocking it as she did so.

Ida started across the room as if to run away. '

“No you don’t!"’ snarled the criminal, “you won't
pass that door alive."

She pulled the trigger.

Snap! went the hammer, but there was no report.

At that instant Ida was catching her cloak from
the chair. ‘ ,

-Next, she was aiming a revolver taken from the
clo.ak,at her enemy. ,

“Laura,” she said, coolly, though her voice shook
on account of the hard struggle she had been
through, “if that gun was loaded I shouldn't have let
YOU. have a _chance with, your knife. This one is
loaded in every chamber, and I am a dead shot !"_

Laura's face suddenly turned ghastly ‘white.

She seemed insane. . ’

Again and again she cocked the empty revolver
and pulled the trigger. . .

Every time it failed to go off she gasped and ut-
tered lo\v exclamations of impatience.

She seemed to think that the knife was in her way,
andpshe thrust it under her arm, so that she could
use‘ both hands freely on the revolver. ‘

an attempt at boldness. - . ‘

Laura gave no trouble on the way to the station.

They left the house so quietly that no one in it
was aroused, and when they were outside they linked
arms as if they were the best of friends.

Ida ﬁxed her prisoner-’s jacket so that it covered
her wrists, and the few persons they met did not
notice that one of the girls was handcuﬁed. '

VVhile they were on the way, Ida asked one_ques-
tion: ,_ ‘

“Did Lan know that y0lt were coming back to the ;
house?” I . '

“No. He wouldn't have let me take the risk." “

The detective‘b::lieved that this was the truth, and
said no more about’ it. i

There was no scene of impottance at the station
Laura had recovered her cool manner, and when the
examination was over, and Ida was starting away,
the prisoner called mockingly:

NICK CARTER WEEKLY.

He was well dressed, and his face, though’ crafty,
was more like that of a gentleman than a criminal.

“Ha!” said he, “two strangers.”

“That one is all right,” explained the man who had
been speaking to Ida. “He’s an expert second-story
operator. The kid wandered in here to drop some-
thing.”

The boss glanced at the second-story thief,
nodded as if the sight satisﬁed him, and turned to.
Ida.

. “\V hat are you here for?” he demanded, sharply.
‘ “I’m here for this,” she responded, taking out her
old watch and ghain, .“ ’cause I don’t want to go any-
where else for it, see? I want to turn it into boodle
and fergit it.” i ‘

The boss took the watch ‘in his hand, looked at it
a moment, and asked:

“How did you happen to come here?”

“ ‘Cause I was told it was the right sort of place.”

“Who told you P” 2 -

“Laura Dash.” ’

; Ida had foreseen this question, and had
her mind How she would answer it.
s. The boss «-started siightly and looked at he;
sharply. . _
t She saw that other men in the room were in-
terested at the mention of that name. _,

Then the boss smiled, and it was a smile of such
villainous satisfaction that Ida was instantly ‘sus-
picious and ‘on her guard. '

“Boys,” said he, “Laura Dash was pulled in less

His name is Lambert. I was pretty certain that I
should get a confession from him, and I succeeded.

“Lamberfs part in the scheme was to receive
stolen goods for Stetson and some others who
worked up that way, and hold it until there was :1
chance to ship it to the fence in North street that we
broke up to-night.

“He told me all about it. The fence is run by the
man they call the boss. He is supposed to be a re-
spectable merchant here in Boston, and he goes
under the name of Hawley. I doubt whether that's
his real name, but it doesn’t matter. His real busi-
ness is the management of thieves.

“For the past twenty-four hours I have been play-
ing thief and getting evidence against Hawley.

“I hadn’t seen the man until to—night, and I was

- in the joint waiting for him.

"My plan was to_ get a good look at him, see how
he did business, then make an excuse to get out and
bring around a squad of police before the gang
broke up for the night.

“As soon as you came in, I knew I should have
to change my schem'e.”

“I hope" my coming didn’t spoil your plan,’
Ida. ,

“Not a bit. It brought things to a head a little
faster. that was all. . I’ve got’ all the evidence we
Wed» 81‘1d'I think we can say that everybody in the
gang is now’ under arrest, except Stetson."

“I hope Nick catches him.”

“So do I, and, as thereis nothing I can do about it
to-night. I Shall goto a hotel and get some of the
sleep I’ve been losing. In the morning I’ll join
Nick.” , .

' They were’ now at ,the( Dover street boarding-

help the police hunt for himself.

‘Another time, when he had been hard pressed by
the police, Stetson had stayed’ for a week at asfarrn,
doing odd jobs about the place for his board and
lodging. L
it He didn’t go away until the police had scoured
that neighborhood and given up the chase.

It caused Nicki and Patsy a great deal of trouble

“Well?” A

“I've been on the ‘watch ever since," said Nick,
“but nothing has happened. I’m sure he couldn't
get out of Boston by rail, for every train is watched
by central oﬂice men. He's gotta go by carriage
road, and, knowing asmuch about him as we do, I
feel that the road leading through this village is the;
one he is most likely to take.” ’

“I’d bank on that,” responded Patsy; “but isn‘t it
probable that he’s got beyond this point already?”

“Do you think he’d get by me ?”

“-Not if he came this,way. ‘He may have taken
some other road.” 4 V . » " 7. ‘

judiciously left behind for leer of accident, and by good
luck there was nobody in it but two outside passengers,
who had nothing for the thieves to take. Last Thursday
notice was given that a gang of rebels was advancing
here under the French standard, but they had no colors,
or any drums except bagpipes. Immediately every man
in the place, including women and children, ran out to
meet them. We soon found our force much too little.
We were far too near to think of retreating. Death was
in every face, but to_.,it* we went, and by the time half
our littleyparty were killed, we began to be all alive
again. Fortunately, the rebels had no guns, except
pistols, cutlasses and pilzes, and as we had plenty of
ntnslteta and ammunition we put them all to the sword.
Not e soul of them escaped except some that were
drowned in an adjacent hog. and. in a very short time
truth‘ was to be heard but silence. , Their uniforms
were all different colors. but mostly green. After the
action we went to runnna can sort of camp, which they
had left behind them. ll we-found was_..a few pikes
without heads, a parcel of empty bottles full of water,

to add that I am in great haste.

so the young man calling up his wife at home told her

Wanted Water Next Time.»
(By M. La Verne, Corbin, Michigan.)

A teacher in a Dallas County (Texas) public school
has received the following letter:

“Sir: Will you in the future give my son easier
somes to do at nites? This is what he's brought hoam
to_or three nites back: ‘If fore gallons of beer Will ﬁll
t11_1Tt)’ too pint bottles, how many pint and a half bottles
will a gallin of here ﬁl?’

“Well, we tried and could make nothin’ of it, at all,
at 311. and my boy cried and said he’d get licket; so I
had why a nine gallin keg of bere, which was aginst
my religion. as well as my pocketbook, and he went
down cellar and got sum bere and brandy bottles; we
ﬁlled them, and my boy put the number down for an
answer. I don’t no whether itis write or knot, as we
spilt sum of the bere, while doing it.

“P. S.——Please let the next some he in water, as I am
not able to buy more here."

 

A Modern Fable.
(BY Guy  Thompson, Indiana.)

Once upon a time a Spring Lamb strayed far from the
Shepherd's precinct, and becoming Weary, he stopped
at a Babbling Brook to refresh his Interior Department.

NOW. it happened to Happen that an old Gray Wolf
was treating himself to a Drink just below at the same
3- B-. and observing the Lamb in the water he called
out, angrily:

“Say. you! Remove your Pedal Extremities from
that Aqua Pura. Can't you see you are tiling the Mud
and thus making the liquid unpalatable?” '

“G9 to. you old Growler!" retorted the Lamb.‘ ‘*1!
the Riled water Riles you, suppose you go and chase
yourself. See?" ’ '

"You will see what I see,” replied the Wolf, who was
fond of _Lamb with Sauce. whereupon he Started in to
make llinceineat of the Innocent. But scarcely had he

btlllﬂithelob when, Lo and Behold. his teeth broke ,

short oﬁ and he was compelled to Sneak away in Dis-
gust, and the Lamb trotted back to his mother, where,

Hints to Coin Collectors.

_ Coins have interested mankind from their ﬁrst incep-
tion _to the present date, and as their numbers have in-
creased there has been a certain quantity laid away and
forgotten for one reason or another, only to be found
years later when, perhaps, their value has increased
enormously; unfortunately,’ there is no established rule
by which their value canibe determined by those who
are not in the business, because the commercial price of
s coin depends upon a number of circumstances, the
, principal fsctorheing the quantity originally coined and
the number of amateurs engaged in forming sets of the
'series to_ which it belongs. For instance, a 2793 half
eesﬁiiiwrynluch rarer than a cent of the same date, but
will not on for as high a price because there are. com-
paratively few collectors of half cents. Then as to date,
the i193 is one of the commonest of the old series of
.,cents, while the next date. 1799. is the rarest. Again,
we pay so cents for an 3873 silver 3 cent piece, and sell
genuine Roman coins, 2,000 years old, for to cents.
Then, the condition of a coin has a great deal to do with
Ti,tI..VIlue; all old coins, in perfect condition, have. some
value, but by perfect condition we mean exactly as it
came from the mint, 3 coin on which you can read every
‘ word plainly may not even be in what we call good con-

H. Earl.—Your coin is what is properly called a cola‘
nial coin of England. It was struck for Virginia in 1773
and passed as half pence. It is an interesting piece to
the American collector, and ‘while tolerably common.
sells for ﬁfty cents. ' ‘

R. R. Kingston, N. Y.—-—If your 2-centbrown. has no i
embossing and is on hard white paper, it is a reissue of 3
1875 and is catalogued at 37, new or used. A set was
issued in !870~7l, on ordinary’ paper, the 2-cent, issue of
which is catalogued at $1.50 new and 2-cent used.

W. I. X.-—Your drawing was not distinct enough for
us to determine what the coin” yqwrefer to is. A ﬂying" ‘
eagle nickel cent of 1858 is worth just about a cent.
Most of the large collectors have such a large stock of
cents of that date on hand that they are unwilling to pay
anything more for them unless they are if: exceptionally
