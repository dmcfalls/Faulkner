CHAPTER V-.—-Driven from His Hor_ne.'~'

Dave was amazed and" stunned by his .uncle'.sr
words. His look of helpless bewilderment‘ was«‘.—
taken by Mr. Dent as evidence of his guiltgand
hishastily formed resolution to throw the’ boy
out of his heart and home was strengthened: .5 

“Uncle Dudley," began Dave. at last. but Mr '
Dent interrupted him. ﬁercely.- . e , 

‘V‘Don’t call me uncle anymore. You have for
feiued all"cla}im' upon my consideration. Leave the
room, and the house as soon as you can.” ’ V

“Do you mean to say thatyou accuse me. at
forging that $2,000 check?” ‘ ‘ ‘ ,_ Q2
A “‘I have said all I'm going to say on the subject.

    
   
   
     
  

   

    
     

  

“You are laboring under a terrible errortsir,

7 " H-is words made no impression on the politician,
:—. who was fully satisﬁed in his own inisnd, that his
' nephew wasguilty of the crime of mulcting the
_ = ‘$2,000 by means of the forged check. Having
~  said all he could say, in his own defense,» Dave
_: ?~ ‘turned and left the library, going upstairs to his
own room, where he sat down and reﬂected bit-
I;ter_ly ‘ on his unhappy positions? Having been
, ordered to quit the house, there was nothing for
 him to do but obey his uncle’s command andrgo,
,  ‘ , o matterliow harshand unfairly hefelt that he
— wa's‘»being- treated. What troubled him most was
‘the thought of leaving under a cloud. He had
very little money and did not know where to go’-
,Suddénly he recalled an/invitation extended to
"him by a schoolmate who lived in the upper part
xof the Bronx.» He decided to go there, pass the
night and decide on his future movements. V He
Twould have to go to work to support himself.
‘- That was certain. His uncle had withdrawn his

 
 
  
 
  

 

  
 
 

world to seek his own living. , -

"“Yes,” he muttered, “he has driven me to work.
, Well, so be it. I’ shall be under less compliment

~11,-have a good education, for which I shall ever

eyes, Dave proceeded to pack up all his belongings.

them into a wide, dimly lighted hallway, whiigi
as it was uncarpeted, echoed their footfalls. a _
the sounds reverberated through the silent house. 0‘ "
At the foot of a wide, bare ﬂight of stairs they
saw a full-length suit of steel armor, with helmet
complete, standing like a knight of old on guard.

At the turn, or landing of the ﬂight, stood a I
similar ﬁgure, rather rusty, with one of its mailed
‘fists supported by a heavy sword.

There was a grilled window, of small different-

’ colored glass, at the back of this landing to fur-

nish light, and above it was suspended" a tarnished-
dragoon’s cuirass. Evidently Silas. Hale was 
either a collector of antiques or he had taken , '
these and other articles of a similar nature, in
settlement of loans. The money lender showed _
his visitors into a big front room that was fur- _ I‘:
nished in a substantial, ‘but business-like way; I
A roll—top desk of solid mahogany stood .close to
one of the windows. There was a book case hold'-
ing many volumes against one of the walls, and’
there was an old—fashioned marble top table with
carved legs, in the centreof the room. Several 
modern chairs stood about at random, and Halo’ , ‘- 5
motioned his callers to take poss sion of two near

safe and took therefroman envelope. Seating 
himself he pulled out of it a number of papers, .
pinned together, and laid them on the desk. ' ,_
“Now to business,” he said. “You have brought“ ”’
the money, of course,” and he held out his hand
toward Herbert, who sat nearest him. ,{_ 
(‘I have brought all I could scrape together-—- '3 '
$1,200-—I presume that will satisfy you for the-. "
present. The balance I will pay later-.. You can
give me the indorsed note, and as many of the‘ ‘
unsecured I 0 Us as you are willing to give up," . '
replied Herbert, taking a roll of bills from his . 
pocket._ The usurer smiled grimly. v ~ ..
“I*thiiik I told you.that I expected you to ‘bring .
the full sum before midnight or/something un-
pleasant would happen tomorrow,” he said coldly
and deliberately. ' s » . v
 “I know you‘ did,” ‘replied Herbert, somewhat
taken aback, “but as $1,200 is more than I actu-
ally owe you, in fact, almost twice as much as I
ever received‘ from you, I thought—’’ 7
!‘It is. evident that you don't know me, young.
man,”. interrupted the money lender. ‘Your-
friend, Gideon Wells, ought to have made your .
position’ clear to you as he——but that is neither
here nor there. Go back and get the balance. I
will give-you till eight in the morning to find the
other $400.” ‘ , . '
. “Isn’t $1,200 enough for the present?” faltefret
Herbert: 4 . ‘. .’

. /.And,what will happen to the obliging individual
1 ‘who forged your father’s signature on the back

,' chuckled in .a cold-blooded way. At those words
‘?*Gideon.Wells gave a slight start, and his. eyes
jnarrowed in a way that would have told the
"usurer, had he known him intimately, that he
was in a dangerous mood.
“It isimpossible for me to raise the other $400
within ‘so short a time.” replied Herbert, des-'

‘ above. a

’  “Very well; that settles it, and we need say no
'I'm'ore on the subject,” said Silas Hale, returning
'the..papers to the envelope and getting up
he 'latter back »in the safe. ‘

Then it was that Wells, who had taken no part

n the money lender-’s arm‘. ' -
_ _‘Mr. Hale,” he said in a tense voice, “we came
ere to get thatpromissory note in particular, and

‘Wells looked into the muzzle of the weapon and

The contents of the telegram rather staggere
Mr. Dent. Gideon Wells had distinctly told him‘
that Great Oak Manor was his family estate,’

the sender of this telegram declared that no peg

Mr. Dent did not know what to think. The
detective returned the note to his pocketbook. ' '
A “Mr.- Dent,” he said, “I suppose it is" no use ‘for
me to ask you for the real address of your son
and his friend, Well_s?” .-  ' 
“If they are not at Great Oak Manor I don
‘know where they are,” he replied, hoarsely.

reply I received.” . ‘ ' . 
He handed the sleuth Gay’s telegram.
“It seems evident, Mr. Dent, that your son an
his companion departed for parts unknown afte‘
leaving a fictitious address with you. It is -up}.
me to find them and bring them back.” ,, ' '

upon the frozen sea. _ ' ..
Captain Essex deplored the loss of his ship, but 
his nature was such an indomitalillle. one that héw 
would not give up hope, and was rm in the b8~_‘_
lief that he would yet reach that point where all
his ambitions centered, ninety degrees south. _ _ .
In the,course of a few days the cave‘ was ‘made’ 
more habitable, a door and frame were ﬁtted to; _ _,
the outer entrance, and preparations were made _ "
to spendthe Antarctic winter, which was n‘ow-.in_j , a .
full vigor. . . ’ 
One day the captain, the two boys, Sadie and’ 
the professor and one man were near the outer ‘ 
entrance, when a strange sound was heard to‘, '
which no one paid much attention at the mome_nt.,: p 
An hour later Professor Waddles arose, looking .  1;
very uncomfortable, and said: , . » , _

“It means,” said Captain Essex, “that this half . —

in some strange manner, that all my instruments»

The entire party, with the exception of the.‘
poor professor, who was in too miserable a statei
to do anything but groan and lean against an ice fl
hummock, all hurried into the cave and toward .
what ‘had been the entrance from the pass. L‘

Before long they ‘saw the light of the aurora‘
iii front of them, and thelcaptain cautioned them.’
to go more slowly for fear of accident. ' ‘

,In a few minutes they came out upon a ledge
ice and saw the water stretching away for so

why we were deceived into thinking it onlyth

_ “I think I have it,” said the captain. f‘At'the

1After-trying in vain to locate the position of

,the;,p'arty ventured to the other entrance, where

, .'to him, ‘.‘and I have come to the conclusion that
I~_am.one of the number.”
, “Whatfs the matter. Uncle Jerry?” asked the
girl. “What ails’ you?” f

_ “Well, my dear, either I am crazy or that moon
..is. the most erratic planet I ever saw.”
" “‘What’s the matter with it?” — .
,. “W.hy,.at one time it’s here;-and at another

it’s there, and then it is somewhere else, and I
don't know whether it is in the north "or west or
where’ it is.” . ,

" The captainlaughed and then replied:
_ “The explanation is that our berg is caught by
opposing currents and swings about, so that you
, see the moon from different, points. We are
adrift, and may expect to see the moon invmany
places.” i - -

I , ""Yes, we are adrift.” - —
 .'?“.De'ar me, then‘ that accounts for it,” and the

lucklessip-rofessor clapped his handkerchief to his
"-mouth and disappeared around an ice hummock. ‘
. ' They were safe -.for the time and quite. comfort-
able, being made more so when the further en-
tranceto the cave was closed, but in the course
of «ﬁve or six days they had drifted .in so many

United States Department of Agriculture.‘ lg th
Eastern United States, and perhaps in'so'me othiar 1
parts‘ of the ‘country, a neighborhood may have},
either but not both qf these trees without danger n
of trouble for both. The cedar and the‘ apple havf '
been found to have a relationship——or antagon-
ism-—similar to that existing -between the bar-
berry bush and wheat, in which each -is aifected A
by one of those strange fungous growths in which
one generation of the fungus develops on one,
plant and cannot reproduce on that plant, but‘:
only on the other of the pair of plants so strange; ’
ply coupled. . - e -. 
For years apple-tree rust was familiar to scien.-. '
tists, as was also the Virginia red cedar‘ rus_t,~g
which produced galls. The two were supposed to '
be-distinct. but after, the wheat and barberry
coupling was established further studies revealed 9
that asimilar-rela,t'onship existed between apple‘;
trees and red cedars.’ [Spores from the cedar all :.,
are blown to apple leaves and fruit, where t ex:
reproduce and cause damage within a few week's,l»
after which the spores of this second. generation»-.~ 
return to the cedar for a lifetime of about twene
vty-two months. ’ . ,
, At first the apple rust affected onlyvnative crab‘
apples, but from, year to year it extended its7da'rn-
age to one supposedly resistant variety after an:
other. Spraying, fatal to most other fungous
growths, did not kill this rust, and Virginia appl
growers found that the best method‘ of prove}:
ing damage was to kill the cedartrees within
distance of a mile totwo of apple orchards. W

“In 1900 the price of brick was $4.50 9.3

laid approximately 2,000 bricks a day. 1, , 
“In 1926 the cost of bricks was $21 a thou;
the bricklayer received $14 a day, and the
of 600 bricks constituted a ‘day’s work. "Th
of laying brick was $5.75 -per thousand i
and it was $37. per thousand in 1926/_’ . '
This statement is being disputed by the
