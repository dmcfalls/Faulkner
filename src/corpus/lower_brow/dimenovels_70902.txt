lad, as he_paused by the stenographer’s desk.
“Well, if you haven't got a cheek, Phil Bris-
tow,” laughed Miss Carpenter, who was a pretty
brunette of seventeen years.
“Sure I have—-two of them." chuckled ,'Phil.
“But I'm dead serious, just now. I've got a.tip."
,“A tip!” exclaimed the girl, with an interested

“Yes. A oointer worth-we_ll. a million to a
person with the money to back it; but to me, with
only ﬁfty cases or so in the savings bank, it won't

spring up every day in my path.‘ '

“Tell me about it, will you, Phil?"

“Couldn’t do it, Ethel, unless

‘Unless what?’

“You will go in with me on it—partners, you
know. Give me your promise ‘to match my ﬁfty

“What was the name of the stock?”

“Say you'll go in with me and I'll tell you."

The girl hesitated. .

“Fifty dollars is——"

“A lot of money. You said that before.”

“I wasn't going to say that." ,

“Well, what were you going to say?”

“I was gains: to sav that ﬁfty dollars is nearly

“I don't know about that,” replied Miss Car-

money in stocks.” ‘

“Bet your life it is. Easier than anythingl
know of, unless you are operating on a sure
thing.”

“I have very little, confidence in Wall Street
speculation ‘for those who are not on the inside."

“I agree with you; but in this little venture

ones. \ .

“That wouldn't nialie any difference.”

“How many shares can‘ you get - with $1.00,
Phil?”

“The stock is ruling now at 49. I can get 9'3
shares on margin. If it goes up ten points we'll
make nearly $100 apiece. .Isn’t that worth while?"

“But will it go up ten points?"

“I'll bet it willgo up ﬁfteen. If it should only.
go no ﬁve- or six we’ll double our money. The
combination of capitalists back of this projected
boom has got millions to boost the stock with and

she spoke again, and Phil’ waited patiently for her
decision.

- “Well, the fact ‘of the matter isl havebeen
trying to win the money at cards, for I'm an ex-

against me," growled Briggs. “I was cleaned out
completely the other night, and had to borrow
enough to see me through till salary day.”
“Then'you admit that you haven't any money at
all?" said Mr. Cutler. »’ '
“I haven't a dollar to my name that I can call
my own."
“You hear what he says, Salter?":,
“My hearing is very good, Cutler,” replied his
associate. .
“What are we going to do about it. Salter?”

Cutler-.", ‘ ‘ '
“And show him that little note oY hand with his
indorsement to it, eh?" -,
“Precisely,” nodded Mr. Salter.’ .
“You mustn’t do it,” ejaculated the cashier, with
a note of fear in his voice. .
“Mustn’t, eh?" retorted Mr. Cutler, with a dry
laugh. “Why not? You've had three months,
haven't you, in which to pay the note, or at least
make some kind of a substantial showing? You've
done neither. When we called your attention to
it you put us oil’ with excuses. Well, we've stood
your excuses as long asowe intend to. Haven't
‘ we, Salter?" '

once. When, the principal can't meet his obliga-

Salter?" ' .
“Most decidedly,” nodded his companion.
“Therefore to-morrow we'll make it our busi-
ness to interview‘ Mr. Hewes; If it willmnke it
any easier for you, Mr. Briggs, you had better let
himiknow what our intentions are.”
A worried, hunted look’ ﬂashed from the cash-
ier's eyes. It was clear that the plan of action

outlined by the twogentlemen concerned him_ not ’

a little. . .

ordered. , While they were waiting for the liquid
refreshment the three men were silent, the cashier

CHAPTER IV.—Phil Bristow Is Accused of
Theft.

_ On his way up town in the car Phil pondered
over what he had heard in the cafe. One thing
seemed" clear to him—that' Mr.' Briggs owed
Messrs. Cutler and Salter the sum of five nundred
dollars, and that the -were tryi to make him

.ante up. Who were and ‘ r? And how
came Mr. I-Iewes's cashier to owe in live thou-
sand dollars‘? They miirht he s brokers. but
Phil did not believe they. were. He could not
imagine how Mr. Briggs into their debt for
such a large sum. Ph ‘ l'earned_anotlier thing
—-that the casliiei-_played.eards torn money. That
fact_ did not grrticularly surprise him. It was
in line with . Wins’: 1- as he had
summed it up. What-really terested him was
the cashier’: oﬂer to put u the ﬁve one thou-
sand dollar Illinois Western nds as security for
the money he owed Cutler and Salter, aﬁer mak-
ing the admission that he was not worth a cent .
he could call his own.» Of wlidln was hegoi to
borrow those bands? What good friend di he
have who-would be so obligingas to loan him‘-the -
use of live Illinois Western securities whose ’ -
ket value was ﬁve thousand ﬁvevhundred dollars
all told? To say the truth, the ironical remarks

 tirely. Was it not Phil’s duty to give Mr. Hewe_s
an inkling of the situation? -
‘I think I ought to,” he mused, “but it's rather
a delicate job to get around. What evidence have
I to offer to substantiate such a serious charge
against the trusted cashier of our ofllce? Not a
particle. Mr. Briggs’s denial would go further
than my statement. It would be better to wait
until the cashier had presumably abstracted the.
bonds from the safe. Then I could tell Mr.
Hewes in conﬁdence what I overheard in the cafe.
If on investigation the bonds were found to be
missing there would appear to be some ground to
suspect Mr. Briggs of having taken them for the
purpose indicated. By hunting up Cutler and
Salter the matter could doubtless be broug-it
home tb thecashier. That will be the better way.
I am beginning to think that I see Mr. Briggs's
ﬁnisﬁ.” _
Next day Phil took a great interest in the
ticker whenever _he got_ a chance to look at it, but
he was rather disappointed to ﬁnd no change yef
for the better in Great Western stock. There
were only two or three quotations of the stock on
the tape all day for comparatively insigniﬁcant
’ blocks of shares, from which Phil concluded that
the syndicate brokers had not yet started in to
buy. He repoited the fact to the"stenograph_er,
and said he hoped that there would be some in-
dication of life in _the stock on the following day.
He ‘had some idea of going up to _the cafe
around four o'clock, with the obyect of witnessing.
if possible, the ' second_ interview between Mr.
Briggs and his two creditors, but he was __ vent-
ed from doingvso by Hr. Hewes sending im up-
town on an errand. Soon after ten next morning

tomer as security for a loan. I handed them to
Mr. Briggs to out in the safe overnight. Next day
I took them to my safe deposit box in the Wash-
ington vaults, where they are now.” .

“Then I suppose it could not have been ﬁve of
those particular bonds that Mr. Briggs referred
to when he told Mr. Cutler that he intended to
borrow them from a friend?”

“Hardly,” replied the broker, with a smile.-

“There is one other thing: Mr. Briggs gave the
two men a note for five thousand dollars indorsed
by you "

“What's that?” asked Mr. Hewes, quickly; ‘a
note indorsed by me! Impossible! 'l have made
it a rule since I went into business—twenty-ﬁve
years ago-—-never to indorse a note under any
circumstances. It is a fatal practice."

“But the note in question, sir, is presumed to
be indorsed by you, though I have an idea that
the two gentlemen who hold it have a suspicion
that your signature is not genuine."

Mr. I-Iewes looked a.-bit startled at this infor-
mation. If his cashier had actually given a note
to secure the payment of a certain debt, and that
note bore his signature across its back as an in-
dorsement, then Mr. Briggs must have placed it
there himself, which act was to all intents and
purposes a forgery whether it resembled his
handwriting or not. 'This was a very serious mat-
ter for him to consider. Mr. Briggs had been a

strusted employee for many years, and now to find
that he might be guilty of such a piece of work
as that was not at all pleasant for the broker to
contemplate. He paced his oﬂice for a minute or
two with a corrugated brow, and Phil waited im-
patiently to be examined further on the matter
:3‘ dismissed. At length llr. I-Iewes paused before
ilm.

“Of course you have id nothing about this
to any one Phil?" he sa' anxiously.

“Certhinl not, sir.”

“Very we I. That will be all,\now."

Mr. Hewes left the oﬂiee, and, instead of go-
ing straight home, he went to his safe deposit
vaults and took out the package su posed to con-
tain the ten one-thousand-dollar I inois Western
bonds. When he examined it he discovered that
six of the bonds were missing, and their places
supplied with folded sheets of thick blank paper
so arranged as to match the genuine bonds.

This discovery gave the broker a great shock-—
not so much on account of the\nioney value in-
volved, but because here was almost indisputable

proof. when taken in connection with Rhil's story‘.

that his cashier was false tohis trust.

‘Flt seems evident that he substituted the paper
for the six bonds during. the short interval that
the securities were in his charge,” said Mr. Hewu
to himself. “Being pressed for the payment of
at debt he could not settle honestly, he yielded to
temptation and embezzled the bonds. it may
that he eventual! tended to return the

Mr. Hewes decidedsthat before he demanded an
explanation of _his cashier he would hunt up
Messrs. Cutler & Salter, who, to his certain
knowledge, were not Wall Street brokers. How-
ever. it appeared that they were conducting some
kind of business in the ﬁnancial district, and next
morning be instituted inquiries among his ac-
quaintances. At the Exchange he met a broker

‘Thank you, Mr. Pratt,” replied. Mr. Hewes;
“that is all I want to know." ‘

He immediately went to the oﬂice of the Man-
hattan Brokerage Company, but neither Mr. _Cut-
ler nor Mr. Salter was visible. When he returned
to his office, about eleven o'clock, Phil had ust
gone into the counting-room to informtMiss ar-

“Does he accuse me of taking them?" asked

“What reason does he give for suspecting me?"

“Merely the fact that you were in a position to

had overheard it, and in about the same words he
had already repeated it to his employer. Briggs
listened to the disclosure like a man wrestling,
with some uncomfortable dream. When Phil had
conéﬂuded, Mr. I-Iewes turned to his cashier and
sai : V

“Do you deny or admit the truthfulness of
Bristow story ?" .

"It's an infernal lie from beginning to end.’
replied Briggs, hotly.

“Then you were not in the cafe with Cutler and
Salter, the managers of the &nhattan Brokerage
Company, the offices of which are on Broadway,
on the afternoon referred to?”

“I was there with them, it is true, but no such
conversation occurred as this young monkey
states."

“You deny that the subject of the conversation
was a debt of ﬁve thousand dollars assumed to be
owing by you to the gentlemen in question?”

“I don't deny that I owe them a sum of mone .”
' “Did ou give them a note to cover that indeit-
erness, aring an‘ indorsement purporting to be
my signature?” _

“I did not.”

“And you did not hand them on the following
afternoon tive of the Illinois Western bonds, taken
from the package I left with you to put in the
safe, nor did on give them in addition the ten
$100 bills you ave practically accused Bristow of
taking from the safe this morning?”

“I did not." '

,“Very well, Mr. Briggs. I hope you have told
the truth, for I shall put a detective on this case
at once. I have found that six of the bonds in
question _are m_issing from the package. This one
I found in Bristow's overcoat appears to he one

‘of them.”

“Then it is more than likely he has disposed of
the other five,” said the cashier, with a vindictive
gleam of his e e, “I am sure now that he took‘
the ten bills. he evidence that that one bond was
in his possession ought to be enough to show you
what kind of a boy he is. I should think that my
word ought to go further than his with you. I
have been in your employ for nine yeara——"

“We won't diséiiss the matter further, Mr.

Briggs, but let the detective ferret out the truth.’

It! am doing you any'inJ'ustice vou shall have
ample amends. You may return to your desk, and
you, Phil, to your post.” ‘

Mr. Hewes put on his hat and coat again and
went out. He went straight to the hfanhattan
Brokerage Company and was so for-tunate_as to
ﬁnd Mr. Cutler in his private olllce. We will not

CHKPTER VI.--Great Western Proves To Be a

As Mr. Hewes could not prove that the money
his cashier had paid over to the managers of the

stolen from his safe, he did not attempt to go to
law about it._ He was thankful to get the ﬁve
heads -back without any trouble, and charged

Great Western closed at 53, and Phil was jubilant. to

but said he would produce it in court if Mr. Hewes
prosecuted the cashier. in an case he meant to
cause the immediate arrest of r. Briggs himself
for deceiving him and his partner with a note
bearing a spurious indorsement.‘ Mr. 'Hcwes then
left the oﬂce and was soon after followed by Mr.
Cutler, who took himself before a city magistrate
and secured a warrant for the arrest of the guilty
cashier. The warrant was handed to an oliicer to
serve. He did not serve it, however, because he
found, on reaching Mr. Hewes' oﬁce what the
broker had also discovered on his return—that
Murray Briggs had left without giving notice of
his intention to do so, and that he had carried
with him all the spare funds,-amounting to several
hundred dollars, that he could lay his hands on.

“I mean he's joined the Down and Out Club."

“Aren't you provoking, Phil Bristowl Tell me
what was the real reason for his leaving so unex-

“Will you keep It to yourself if I tell you?”

“Of course I will." »

_Whereupon Phil told\her the particulars of the

. C858.

“My gracious!" she exclaimed, when he finished
hlis story. “I~had no idea that he was as bad as
t at.”

“He won't bother you with his attention any
more now.”

“That is a relief, at any rate. I was getting a
little nervous over his persistency. He simply
wouldn't take a hint."

“Well, so long as he has taken his departure you
needn't care," laughed Phil, walking away.

Next morning there was something doing in
earnest around the Great Western standard.
Brokers appeared on the ﬂoor with their hands
full o_f orders to buy the stock, and there ensued
such a lively scramble for shares that the price
soon went up to 55. This rise evidently came too
soon to suit the boomers, for a bear movement
was organized to pound it down again,‘ and for the
rest of the day the stock fluctuated several points
either way, ﬁnally closing at 56.

“If 1 closed\eur deal in the morning,” said ran
the stenogra er that afternoon, “we would

_ “I don't intend to. - I'll sell when _I see it show-
ing signs of-getting top heavy."

Next morning the rush to buy Great-Western
was srreaterthan ever. so that by noon it was
quoted on the ticker at 60. Just before Phil went
out to lunch he shoved a slip of paper on Miss
g0ar1p.§n"ter's table, which read: “1,000 G. W.

She read it, and smiled in a pleased way, for

half of which is yours. You ought to be able to
buy two gowns and two hats with that.”

, Ethel smiled as she read the ‘words. It was a
great relief after all to know that the deal had
been successful. She had been afraid that Phil
might hold on too long, and thus ruin their pros-

‘pects. -But he hadn’t, and she was much elated

over the satisfactory result. : .
V “Well,” said Phil, later on, “what did I tell you?
Was there anything the matter with that tip?”

“Not athing, Phil. I thank you-ever so -much
for persuading me to go in with you. You're the
best boy in theiworld.”

“What would you have called me if our luck had
run the other way?" he chuckled.

.“I shouldn't have blamed you.”

“You can gamble on one thing, E hel. I never
would have asked you to risk your fty dollars on
anything that I didn't have good reason to ﬁgure
as a sure winner.” ‘ ‘ y ‘ s

TIPPED BY THE TICKER

'two gentlemen, whom Phil recognized as well-

known curb brokers, called to see Mr. Hewes.

The bo- took their names into the private room,
and Mr. liewes told him to show_ them in. Five
minutes later 9. messenger boy entered the wait»
ing-room with a letter for Mr. Hewes, which he
said was important, and required an immediate
answer. So Phil carried it in to his employer at
once. As he entered the room he overheard some
of the conversation that was going on between
the two curb brokers and Mr. Hewes.

Enough to make him wise to the fact that they
had evidently come to borrow money on some
Louisville ' Southern stock. Apparently they
wanted more than Mr. Hewes was willing to give.

' As Phil handed the envelope to his employer,
one of the brokers said that the prospects were
that Louisville Southern ‘would ‘surely keep its
price at or above its present ruling price for some
time to come. At any rate, they only wanted the
money for 48 hours, and were willing to pay well
for the acommodation. Mr. I-Iewes read the note
that Phil brought to him, scribbled a reply which
he enclosed in another envelope and addressed,
and handed itto the boy. 1

“Look up Louisville Southern on the tape, Phil,
and bring me the last quotation, please,” he said.

“Yes, sir,” answered Phil, hastening out of the
room. ‘A

« Héhanded the envelope to the waitin messen-
ger and then consulted the tape at t e ticker.
He found a record of ‘the sale of 1,500 shares of
L. S. at 82 3-8, and he carried the information
into the private oﬁice. When he came back to the
reception-room he thought he might as well watch
and see if any more quotations of L. S. came over
the wire. . ' ‘

There was nobody in the room just then but
himself. and so he had full swing at the indicator, .
which was ticking merrilly awav its metallic song. .
As Phil let the tape slidethrough his ﬁngers into
the tall wicker basket alongside the’-machine, his
sharp eyes, accustomed to translate at a glance
the abbreviations that indicated the transactions
'0¢Wl‘!’i!!£' on the ﬂoor of the 5'4‘ ‘~" Exchange}'saw
a fresh quotation pf L. S. at 82 1-8. '

In another «moment came second one indicat-
ing’ that 2,000 shares had anged hands at 82.
a- reak of’-half a point from the record he had
carried in to his employer. Phil, however, looked
to see,the stock recover, instead of which a third
quotation came out of the ‘sounder noting the
sale "of 1,800 shares at 81 ‘i=8. Another quotation 
showed that Louisville Southern was still going
down, "for itindicated a sale of 81' 5-8. ' i

“I guess the boss ouglﬂz to know of this,’ he
said. “It's dropped a point inside of two minutes.’
for at that moment another sale of L. 8. was

The wily brokers were thoroughly taken aback.
They had obtained advance information of the
impending break in the stock and had visited Mr.
Hewes on purpose to raise money on a block of
the shares which they had not the right to sell,
as it did not belong to them. They would have

made a speedy exit from his oillce. ' .
‘How came you to watch the ticker, Phil_‘."'
asked Mr. I-lewes, with a smile.
‘Well, sir, as I got the idea from a few wdrds

That day he met Bob Davis, who also told him
that L. & M. was due for a rise. The next morn-
ins: L. dz M. started upward with a rush. Several

Phil ordered his shares sold. also Miss Carpen-

Carpenter was $360 ahead of the game.

Cl-IAPTQIR VIlI.—A I-lard-earned Tip.

Three months had passed away since the for-
tunate deal in L. & M., and Phil had saved enough
out of his wages to make him worth an even
$2,500. Miss Carpenter could show a bankbook
with a credit for 8500, all of which she told Phil
she owed to him for taking her in with him in his
two lucky deals.

One afternoon, at the beginning of warm
weather, when Phil got out of the elevator on the
sixth ﬂoor of the Mills Building to deliver a mes-
sage at the oliice of Deering & Co., he was sur-
prised to see one of the doors opening on the
corridor ﬂung wide with a bang and a boy pro-
jected through it as if shot from. a catapult.

The boy performed a couple of somesaults be-
fore he landed with a whack against the opposite
wall, while two highly excited gentlemen stood
in the doorway and shook their ﬁsts at him, at the
same time saying things that wouldu’: look well
in print. ' ‘

As the unlucky lad picked himself up, and be-
gan an examination to see if there was anything
missing in his make-up, the gentlemen di.sap-
peared. slamming the door after them. Phil
stopped, in his astonishment at the strenuous per-
formance, wonderuig what sin the boy had com-
mitted to entitle him to such rough handling. He
started for the boy, to sympathise with him.

“What they were talking about.” 1

“I don't wonder they resented it.”

“What is the tip?” '

Phil told her. > .,

“Well, if you go into it I will," replied EtheL

“You’ve got ﬁve hundred dollars?",

“Yes.” .

“How much of it do you want to risk?”

‘.‘How much would you risk?” ’ .

“I’m going to buy three hundred shares. and
that will take nearly all my‘ wad to cover the
margin.” »

“How many shares could I get?”

.Phil made a mental calculation.

“At the present ruling price you could get about
seventy—ﬁve, but I advise you not to go in for
more than sixty. That will leave you with about
seventy dollars pocket money."

“Shall I bring my money down in the morning?”
asked Miss Carpenter. ‘ ‘

“Yes. You can put it in the safe, if I don't
wantto use it for a day or.two."

Phil watched I. '& C. stock for several days,
without- observing any change in its price, or any
particular activity in the sales. On the ﬁfth day
after Bob got the tip Phil was over at the

of the cause of the gathering. '

“A man has: fainted or has got a ﬁt—I don't
know which,” was the reply. '

_ Phil- managed to worm his way into the crowd
and found that the fallen man was one of the
brokers who had an oﬂice on that ﬂoor. Just then
the superintendent of- the building appeared and,
with the assistance of one of the spectators, car-
ried gthe stricken broker in his oﬁice. As the
crowd began to scatter, Phil saw a dapper-looking
young man in the act of taking a watch from the
white vest of a portly looking gentlema . The boy
made a.‘ jump for the thief and caugh his wrist

with the watch in his hand. The light-ﬁngered

individual, however, was accustomed to  on_’ his
guard at all stages of the game, and, as his_ right
arm was at liberty, he struck Phil a blow in the
face, which caused the young messenger to release
his grip. and ﬂed down the corridor toward the
stairs. Phil slipped on the marble ﬂoor, but was
up in a twinkling, just as the gentleman missed
his watch. The boy darted after the crook, ‘just
disappearing around the corner of the corridor,
and the stout gentleman yelled “Stop thief !" and
started‘ to follow. That created ;new excitement
on the ﬂoor, and the time Phil was halfway
down the stairs ha 1 a _dozen_ i-sons had joined
in the pursuit. The thief in his ﬂight_collided
with a ssnctimoniousflookmg man clad in black
at the foot of the staii_'s._ He was a collector for
one of the foreign missionary societies. Being
somewhat nearsighted, he did not «observe the
cyclone bearing down on him until’ too late to
avoid ‘a-fmixup. The two performed .an impromptu
acrobatic act, but the’ crook, being as agile as a
young monkey, quickly extricated himself from
the dilemna and dashed through the doorway
into Wall Street just as Phil reached the lower
cos-rider: The messenger, however, saw him turn

“This is the chap who took your watch, isn’t
it?” asked the man who held on to Phil.

“He’s'the one,” sputtered the victim.

“Search him," suggested one of the crowd.

.Phil protested vigorously, ‘declaring they were
making a serious mistake, and that the real thief
was a block away toward Water" street by this
time; but his words made no impression on the
crowd, while‘ two speqators went through his
pockets without result. . V

“He must have thrown the watch away," said
the tall man. .

“Look here," cried Phil, “you’ve just made a big
blunder. My name is Phil Bristow, and I'm
George Hewes’s messenger. [saw the theft com-
mitted, and started to catch the fellow, but he
struck me in the face and got away. Then I
chand him, and your stupidity in mixing me up
with him has enabled him to get clean oﬁ by this
time.” I

His statement was received with some incredul-
ity, inthe face of the fact that the stout man
asserted he knew that Phil had taken his watch.

“You're crazy!" replied Phil, in a disgusted
tone. “I didn't take your watch, and you haven’t
any evidence to show that I did.” _

“You ran away—that’s evidence enough."

“I just told you that I ran after the thief.’

“That won't go down,” said the tall man, taking
a fresh hold on the boy’s collar.

“Tdke me back to the Barnum ‘Building, then.
The porter or the superintendent will tell you who
I am. Or you can take me to Mr. Hewes's oﬂice."

“Here's a policeman," said a voice,,as an of-
ﬁcer was seen approaching the crowd, which by
this time had assumed large proportions, at the
corner of Wall and Pearl streets. \

When_the policeman made his way into the cen-
ter of the mob he heard the fat man s story, Pl‘i'iz's
story, and the remarks of other persons o
thought they‘ knew something about the matter.

The oﬂicer decided that the boy, who did not
look like a sneak thief, should be allowed to clear
himself, if he could, before he would take him to
the station. On the way back to the Bamum
Building Phil saw a well-known broker crossing
the street to see what was the matter. ‘The
broker knew him” well, and the boy called the of-
ﬁcer's- attention to. that fact. The policemen stop-
ped and beckoned to the broker. _

“Mr. Brown, I wish you'd tell these people who
1 am.” said Phil. “I've been" mistaken for s thief
who_ stole this gentleman's watch in the Bsi-nun

Building. I was chasing the rascal when I was '

stopped and accused of the crime myself.”

The broker read-ily identiﬁed Phil as Mr. George
Hewes's in ‘ r,‘ and said he would guarantee
that the boy was all right. '. .

“It's evident that a mistake, has beenioade, and
Pthink Bristow is entitled tcian apology. He has
sulfemd considerable unnecessary hiimilistion. and
might reasonably bring an. action for

_ damages
against the" person responsible for the blunt:-,"_

said the broker. .

“That's all right," replied Phil. “I might have
recovered your watch if I had not been stopped.
As it is, I guess you'll never see it again.” . '
. The crowd, who had been assured of Phil's guilt,
were now satisﬁed that it was all a mistake,_and
began to make remarks concerning the stupidity

of some people. The oﬂicer strolled away, and the‘

_ mob thinned out, leaving Phil and the stout gen‘-
tleman by themselves.

“I'm sorry I qaused you so much annoyance,

young man.” he said. “Here is my card. Call and

see me. I should like to make you a present of_

something to compensate you for
“It'isn’t necessary, sir. I'm only sorry that I

‘Well, I‘should be glad to have you call and
aee me some time, anyway."

“I'll keep your card, and will drop in some,after-

They shook hands, and‘then Phil went on his

from the oﬂice with.

That afternoon there was some little excitement
in the Exchange over I.‘ & C. Quite a number of
buying orders came to the surface, and the com-
petition to get the stock caused it to go up to 78.

Then there was an effort made to bear it down,
and it was successful to the extent of. causing the
price to fall back to 74, at which quotation the
shorts tried to buy enough in to £11 their engage-
ments: This caused the stock to go upto 75 3-8,
and it ﬁnally closed ‘at 76 7-8. _

“I'm a thousand ahead of the game, so far,"
laid Phil to the stenogra , when he took the
ﬁnal quotation in to Miss arpenter. “And you're
more than $200 to the good.” .

- ‘Isn't’ that ﬁne?’ she exclaimed. “I really be-
lieve that we're going to make another l_i_ttle

‘.0!’ course we are. That's the advantage of
speculating ‘with inside information.” .

Half an hour later Phil was 08 for the day, and
reached for his hat.’ When he turned around he
saw Bob Davis comingin at the door. '

“Hello, Eob! Whatbrought you around?"

‘Want to walk up the Bowery with me?"

the big newspapers" have their offices facing City
Hall Park. They passed the Brooklyn Bridge en-‘
trance and continued on up the continuation of
what is now known as Park Row extension. When
they came to a row of one-story shops. Phil
paused before one that was occupied as a book-
store. ‘

“Hold on a moment, Bob. I want to get a book
to read."

They went inside. Phil had evidently been there
before. for the young fellow behind the desk
nodded to him. '

“Good afternoon. Tom." said Phill. “This is
my'friend Bob Davis. Bob, this is Tom Leonard.”

“Glad to know you, Leonard," said Bob.

“Same here," ieplied Leonard, who was pasting
a cover on a paper novel.

“I came to get a book, Torn.”

“Go‘around and pick one out. There’s lots
of ‘em on the shelves. What kind of a book do
you want?" .

_ “I want.the Three Guardsmen."

“I'll get it for you. I've got one good copy
here. It will cost you twenty cents. If you bring
it back we’ll allow you ten cents on it.”

Phil looked the book over, ‘and coniluded that

he'd buy it.

“Are ou interested in palmistry?” asked Leon-
ard, as e was doing the book up.

“Kind of," replied Phil.

“I don't take much stock in such things, but
lots of people buy these books. Say. come to
the back of the store, and I'll introduce you to the
Professor." r .

. “The Professor!‘ exclaimed Phil. ,

“Yes. Professor Gregory. He'll read your hand
if I ask him to, and it won’t cost you a cent.
He comes in here occasionally. He’s a wonder.
He told me lots of things that actually came out
just as he said they would." .

Phil was interested, so he and Bob accompanied
Leonard to the back of the store, where a good-
lookmz young man. with eyeglasses, was looking
over ,a pilqit second-hand, cloth-bound books. -

Tom introduced Phil and Bob to the Professor.
“They found him a very pleasant person to talk

“That's right. I was nearly arrested to-day on
the charge of stealing a man’: watch."

“You haven't seen the last of the affair. You
will make something out of it yet.”
, “What will I make?”

“I couldn't tell you,” answered the Professor.
You may meet the thief and recover the watch."

“Not much chance’ of that,” laughed Phil.

“You can't tell," said the Professor in his low
voice. “There are indications that you may meet
with a serious'accident before long. However, I
can almost promise that you'll make a good deal
of money before the year is out. There’s a
young lady associated with you in the matter.
She will also be fortunatewith you. It is not i_m-

“You're welcome. I"could have told you more

The boys then left him. There were several.

” one at these Bob piloted the way. They passed
Ntm-ongh a kind of storm door and found them.-
selves in an oblong room with a counter running
the full length, behind which there were several
bright-looking clerks. There was only one person
them at the time the boys*entered, a dapper-Iook-
ing young fellow with a smooth face and ferret-
like eyes. He was arguing with a clerk over the
amount of money he wanted on a heavy gold
watch. The‘ moment Phil's eyes rested on him he
recognized him. He was the crook who had stolen
the shout gentleman’: watch in the Barnum Build-
ing that morning. ‘

where he was locked up. The stout gentleman,
whose name was Darley, was anxious to learn how
the thief had been caught. Phil told him how he

with the help of his friend, had captured him.

The stout gentlemarrtook a car uptown, while
Phil and Bob returned to the pawnshop to get the
dictionary. Of course, the story of the'capture of
the thief who had stolen Mr. Rufus l)arley’s
watch in the Barnum Building was duly chron-
icled in the newspapers next morning. and Phil
Bi-istow’s name, and Bob’s, as well, appeared in
cold type. Phil was given the credit for the cap-
ture, and the incident of the preceding morning,
when he himself was chased and then held up as
the thief, thereby affording the crook all the
chance he wanted to make his escape, was also de-
scribed, with such embellishments as the ubi-
quitous reporter is accustomed to garnish his
narrative when he gets the space in which to
spread himself. Mr. Hewes read the account at
breakfast, and when he reached the oﬁice he sent
for‘ Phil and congratulated him on what he had
done. Ethel Carpenter read the story on the cars
as she “as on her way to work from her aunt's
home ;ln Brooklyn, and she‘ also had something
complimentary to say to Phil as shot: as she met
him in the oﬂice. All the clerks had read the
paper before they arrived, and each stopped ‘to
shake hands with Phil and tell him whata clever
fellow. he was. Durin the morning several hm-
kers who‘knew Phil we lstopped him on the street
andhad something nice to say on the subject. At
eleven o'clock Mr. Darley called at theoflice to
go~w1th him to the Tombs, according to directions
they had received from the police.

CHAPTER XII.—Phil Makes a Big Haul.

A whole week went by, and Miss Emmett’: las.
day in the oﬁice was close at hand before there
was any sign of a movenientin D. & P. In fact,
the market had been practically dormant all sum-
mer, and it was the exception, not the rule, when
a stock began to attract especial notice. Phil had
watched the ticker with his old—time alertness,
having plenty of chance to do it; but though he
noticed a great many sales of the stock in question
scattered along the tape, the price did not advance
at any time more than a point, and sometimes fell
back to 60 again. But one morning the market
woke up and the brokers began to get busy. The
news that M. & N. had come under the control of
the D. & P. interests was made public and con-
ﬁrmed. Immediately there was a rush made by
the tr ers to buy stock ofthe latter road. Then
the fact developed that the shares were scarce as
hen’s teeth. _Wlioever had any of it heldxon to it,
for they realized that they had a good thing. All
day long the brokers scurried around the Street
to locate a seller, but in vain, while as high as 70
was oifered, with _no takers, before the board
closed. Next day it opened at 72 1-8, and then
rapidly mounted ‘to 75. Phil felt like dancing a
highland ﬂing. ’

“Gee! That was a ﬁne tip you gave me, Miss
Emmett,” he whispered in her ear. I -

“I should think so,’ she replied. “I’ve made
$1,000 olrea up How much did you buy?” .

Phil look at her, and debated whether he
should tell her -the exact truth. Finally he de-
cidedvthat he would. Aw

“Ibought 1,200 shares.‘ .

Miss Emmett nearlyfeiiited.

“Twelve hundred!” she exclaimed. ‘Why,

“Did I set the margin 1' he interrupted. “Easy

enough. I had ii certiﬁcate of deposit for $7,700

“Why, I._.had no idea that you were worth mon-

shares were no longer hard to get. When Phil
saw that the sales were becoming uncommonly
numerous he rushed upstairs to the public stenog-
rapher’s' oﬁice and interviewed Miss Emmett, who
had gone back there on Monday. She told Phil
she was just thinking of selling, as she had re-
ceived a note from the broker who had given her
the tip advising her to get out at once.

“That's what I am going to do. Give me an
order on the bank to sell your shares, too, and I
will put it in with my own."

She wrote it out and handed it to him. Then.

he started for Nassau street as'if the fate of the
nation depended on his speed. There was a crowd
in the waiting-roam, and a line at the margin
clerk's window that held him back twenty min-
utes. But he readied the goal at _last’.

“I want you to sell my 1,200 shares of P. & D.

at once,‘ he said to the clerk. t

The g man nodded.

“An here is an order from the young lady for

whom I bought 109 shares to sell hers, too."

“All ' ht, repied the clerk.

The.o rs were telephoned to the bank's bro-
ker. and in a quarter of an hour the 1.300 shares
were bought in by some broker acting for a cus-
tomer, and the price that Phil and.Miss Emmett

' got was 90. 7-8. Phil went back to the omce and
in his spare moments ﬁguring up how much
had made. He found that he had cleared a
little over thirty-six thousand dollars.

There‘ was a suspicious redness about the

stenogi-apher’s eyes when she returned to her ma-

chine. _It was the ﬁrst falling out she and Phil
had ever had. She made her ﬁngers ﬂy on her
work and tried to forget all about it. Phil did

an hour later, he had to go out again. Altk that
he had to go to the bank, so that it was more
than three hours before he had a breathing spell.

‘Then Mr. Hewes handed him some papers to carry

to Miss Carpenter. - _

“I want to tell you the whole story of how I
came to get that tip," he said, after laying the
papers on her table. And he did, though she pre
tended not to listen t’o him. “I made th' —six

just as much interest in seeing you win as I do in
winning myself. I. think I proved that in our two

TIPPE_D BY THE TICKER

scnger for Mr. Hewes, had been struck by an
automobile on Broadway and removed to the hos-
pital. It was uncertain yet how bad his injuries
were, as he was still in the hands of -the doctors.

Five minutes later Miss Capenter, looking
greatly upset, entered Mr. Hewes’s private room
and with quivering lips told him of the accident
that had happened to Phil.

“My graciousl” cried the broker, very much
startled. “Struck by an auto, and at the Cham-
bers Street Hospital? I must go right over!”

He grabbed his hat and left the building, after

,telling the news to the cashier, who in turn com-
municated it to the clerks. Everybody _was sorry
to hear that Phil had been injured, for he was a
iavorite in the place, andywork came to a stand-
still for a little while. As for Ethel Carpenter,
she bent over her machine and buried her face
in her handkerchief. The hospital man had said
very little, but what he did say was, ratherob-’
vious, and the stenognpher was so nervous and
excited that she coi:rd not do another stroke. of
. work to save her life. Mr. I-lewes returned to his
oﬁce about half-past twelve and reported that
Phil was not seriously injured, but had received
a bad shaking up, and would be conﬁned to his
bed for several days. This intelligence was re-
ceived with great satisfaction by the other em-
ployees. Mias,Carpe‘nter felt greatly relieved,‘but
her work that afternoon showed several errors,
which was a sign that her thoughts were not as
close to_busineas as usual. At h_alf—p_ast four she
left the oaﬁce, andvinstead of going directl home
she walked over to the Chambers Street ospital
and asked how the young messenger was getting
on. She received an encouraging answer and
went away. The young doctor who held the brief
conversation with her did’not ask her name. _so
when he visited Phil, later on, he simply told him
, that a young lady had called and inouired about
him. He described the visitor with Iuﬁicient ac-

 “Not a thing,” was the reply.

“Well, D. J: G. looks like a good thing. Why

“Are you?" asked Bob.

Next day a well—known ﬁnancial daily came out
with a statement that everything pointed to an
alliance between D. & G. and the management of
the coal and iron road, and as a consequence the
shares of the former road began to boom again,

the shares receded to 96 the soon recovered and
went to 1029.. Over night the coalition between
the two roads became generally known as a fact.

A new island sprang up in the sea of Azov,

FROM EVERYWHERE

however, the tardiness of this report, which should
have been made thirty years ago, is attributed to
the fact that George W. Hawkins is a very quiet
man.

Mr. Hawkins, 3 school teacher, has lived in
Setauket almost half a century. On a summer
afternoon back in 1894 he was in his garden, dig-
ging holes in which to place poles for climbing
bean stalks. His shovel struck something hard.
He scooped out a handful of gold coins. Diggin
further, he gathered up more than a hundrecf
Washed, they roved to be Spanish coins with
dates varying mm 1770 to 1775.

Mr. Hawkins, now retired, was surprised when
neighbors began asking about the ﬁnd. How news
of it leaked out he does not know. Why he kept
it secret these many years he refuses to divulge.

The coins are said to be of considerable value.
Their finder has disposed of some, but the price
received is among the things he intends to keep
secret. ‘ _

During the Revolutionary War, he said, the
house in which he lives was occupied by 2 Rev.
Mr. Brewster, astor of the old Presbyterian
Church on the vi lage green. He believes the coins

‘ may have been buried hastily before a skirmish

between American and British soldiers.

OCEAN TESTS

Transatlantic telephone tests have been con-
ducted for some months past by the American
Telephone 8; Telegraph Company and the Western
Electric Company engineers. In fact. rumor has
it that commercial conversations may be carried
on before the end of the year. For the present.
special attention is being paid to modulation and
to the development of secrecy. Daily talks with
a British receiving station have been carried on‘
from the great transmitting station at Rocky
Point. some 70 miles east of New York. on Long
Island. Test words and short phrases are re-
peated hundreds of times by a large sun’ of en-
gineers and operators. who record their observa-
tions for the beneﬁt of the designing engineers.
Secrecy it is reported, will be acthlizved by
“scrambling” the conversation at the t mitting
end and “unscrambling” it at the receiving end.
In this manner it will /be possible to make radio
telephone conversations private. There is a very
remote chance that some ingenious experimenter
may picked up disconected bits of conversation.
but as a general things the radio telephone user
$11 enjoy the_ same secrecy as the wire tele-

‘ DESCRIBES TRANSFORMERS

Radio frequency transformers vary somewhat
in construction, but in general they consist of
two coils of very ﬁne copper or sometimes even
iron or other resistance wire. One coil is the’
“primary,” the other the “secondary.” Unlike the
audio instruments. the windings consist of only
a few hundred turns. or perhaps a lot more than
_a hundred, depending on the make. There is
no heavy iron core, but there may be. a light
one consisting of a paper tube ﬁlled with line
iron ﬁlings. .

Radio frequency ampliﬁers are placed in the

‘circuit ahead of the detector to amplify the in-

cogning currents at radio frequency before they
are rectiﬁed to lower frequency by the detector.
Radio frequency ampliﬁers increase the range of
a set as they intensify the weak signals. giving
them strength enough to operate the detector.
Audio frequency ampliﬁers follow the detector in
the circuit. They ‘amplify the audio frequency
signals passed on by the detector. Audio ampli-
ﬁers increase the volume of signals. but do not

increase the range.

Pushmull transformers have ﬁve bin 'ng post:
because there is an extra coniiectiou en from
one of the windin s.’ in the input transformer.
the secondary coi is tapped at its eentreand
a wire brought out to a terminal. The primary
is one continuous windins. giving two more

HOW TO MAKE A WATER TELESCOPE

A One of the most interesting devices for study-
ing the ways of ﬁshes and other aguatic ‘crea-
tures is the water telescope. In its construction
the instrument is very simple. A tube is iirst
made of copper zinc. or other metal which will
not rust. The tube should be not less than
3 feet in length and" may with advantage be
longer. At one end lit a circle of very clear
plate glass._ To ﬁx the glass a’ ring of metal, to
act as aﬁange. should be soldered inside, the tube

a short distance from the end. The circle of glass ~

should rest on this.- white lead being used on
the other side to keep the glass in place and
make the tube watertight.

Thetelescope is used by pushing the end with
the glass below the-surface and resting the tube
on the edge of a boat or the bank. The depth

- to which the observer can see will naturally de-

pend on the clearness or _otherwise of the water.
In clear water it is possible to see quite plainly

.- objects that may be ﬁfty feet or more away.

The most‘ favorable» opportunities occur when
bright sunshine is streaming down through the
water. Many interesting ﬁshes can be observed
at verv moderate depths. Care should be taken
to keep the water telescope quite still. as sudden
movements are likely to startle the ﬁshes. When
an evening is quiet the fishes, impelled by cu,-i-
iosity. may come close-_to the end of the telescope,
and unique opportunities arise for studying their
peculiarities and, behavior.

“THIRTEEN
0’CLOCK”

I

A m o n g t h e
man y legends
that circle around
Windsor Castle is
the story of the
sleeping sentry.
As Arum-rrs, a
London publica-
tion, tells the
story, the sentry
was arrested for
sleeping on duty
and saved himself
from being “shot
at dawn" by
stoutiy declaring
he was not z1.<lee])
at all. To prove
this he averted
that in the deep
silence of mid-
night he heard ii
1 o c a l church
clock strike, not
twelve but thir-
teen.

So wild and im-
probable a state-
ment startled his
judges, who nost-
poned _:<enten-_-e to
allow inquiries to
be made. Sever-
a l w i t n e‘ s s e s
thereupon ‘testi-
ﬁcd that the clock
did actually
strike thirteen on
that night and
the sentry was
acquitted.

The guards-
man‘s name was
John Hatﬁeld,
and the .incident
occurred
reign of William
and Mary.

“Not at all im-
Drobable," com-
mented a police-
man of to-day.
when he heard
the story. “It's
this way: you
hear a clock
strike ‘twelve,’
done 08 and then
hear that clock
strike ‘one’
twelve and one
