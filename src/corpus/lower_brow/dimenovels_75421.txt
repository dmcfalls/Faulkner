year, Fred knew that his wife and stepdaughter‘? Vi v
would ‘be’ safe from any trouble that he could.
make. The rascal "captured by Fred and Thorpe

would not be put on a trial for a month. He had
been identiﬁed by several, of the mounted con-

stabulary who were in town as a member of the‘
Redlaw gang, and the authorities intended; to

- make an example of him.

It was hoped, however, before his trial came’
on that more of the rascals would be taken. On
Wednesday morning about ten the stage left 
Hobart Town en route for the gold ﬁelds and
Blackpool. Mr. Manners had an inside seat while‘
Fred and Thorpe rode on the roof, where they
could get a better view of the country. There
were about a dozen passengers /altogether, and
thestage also carried a mail bag and an express
box, both stowed away under the driver’s seat.’
They stopped at an inn on the outskirts of a
large-sized village for dinner.

After leaving the village a mile or two the road n
branched away from all signs of civilization, and
for miles they scarcely saw a house. The scenery .
was wild and strange to Fred, who viewed it with
interest. x, The trees were straight and'of large A
size, verylike those in the interior of Australia.’ 4 '

Brilliant ﬂowers, and luxuriant grass and T I
shrubs, all of a» species,,tota1ly unlike anythingghe ~
had ever seen in. California, abounded, Locusts ' f
chattered on the trees, mosquitoes ﬂitted, thrmrglr V ’
the air, and birds of gorgeous plumage screamed

stretching away_on either side of the roadfalong. , 
which the stage bowled.‘  ‘ ' ,” 
f‘Here’s a splendid view-,”, said Fred to Thorpe;  _ .-
as the coach swung around "a‘ sharp §urn"in the-j.;..
road where a wide opening in the trees discl 
on one side a,broad vista of undulating 1and— j
scape, through which ran a river that shimmer-,ed
in the afternoon sunshine. - -=' ‘,._‘
“Spendid,”r replied Thorpe. “It reminds me of 
a place,I once visited in England near——hello!f.' gt‘
What’s the matter?” » ‘ vj
The exclamation was drawn from him by the ..
abrupt reining in of the horses by the driver,‘ ;
from whom escaped Jan ejaculation of ,consterna— ’
tion. Four horsemen had suddenly appearedin;
the road in front of the stage: They were masked’

        
     
        
   
   
      
       
    
    
        
    
  
  
 

covered the driver, and the passengers on "the
roof. 5 Two other men, also masked and mounted‘, _
came out of the .tall, thick underbrush, rode up,
to either side of the coach, and, presenting to the"
dismayed travelers the muzzles of a couple-‘of:
revolvers, cried out: ' 4 ._ ‘ » .,
“Gentlemen, I'll trouble you to get out andxline
up one the side of theroad.” ' t  
“My grac'ious!”‘ejac11lated Fred. “What does

“It’s a hold-up,” replied Thorpe. “We’v‘e

‘Outside and inside passengers were soon lined

,, to speak of, for Mr. Mannerswas paying all his
_ex‘penses,. so the hold-up did not worry him
.7 greatly.‘ He felt sorry for those who happened
_ I ‘-to be well supplied /with money, as. two or three
,'were’. While two of the road agents, starting

gassengers all their valuables, two others were
nsy vriﬂing the coach of the mailpouch and

’ ‘appeared to be the leader of the bunch, sat on
their horses, with their‘ guns ready for instant

the camp-—the rest surrounded them - and fol-
 lowed. . ‘ V ‘ . .
. _ Before the boy could make any reply to Baxter's ,
misgivings the‘ ﬂapiofthe tent was thrown aside
and a big, ruiﬁantly looking man stepped outside
and confronted them. As Fred’s eyes rested on
. him hegave a gasp; The man was Redlaw the
8 .‘'road agent. Redlaw gave a‘start of_ surprise on
~recog‘ni.zing Fred. Then a malicious grinrspread
« overhis features. ‘ ,' ‘
“So, young man, you’ve thought better of run-
nin’ away from" me and have dropped in here to
say you’re sorry that you gave me so much trouble
V last night," he said in 'a bantering tone.‘
V ‘Cl guess you‘ know well enough that isn’t so,"
replied Fred, who had receovered his self—posses-.
- ' sion. “It strikes me thatyou and your crowd
 -have captured this camp, and we have ridden into
a trap.”  .
' .“You’,re clever at guessing, you are," laughed
Redlaw. “Now that I’ve got hold of you perhaps
you can guess what's likely to happen to you?” »
,"I dare say that you’d likeme to :join your

tion he had overheard the previous night; “but I
prefer to choose my own company.” '

as the ﬁrst signs of dawn appeared in the eastern
sky, and the sky‘ began to clear rapidly, with every
[promise of a ﬁne day. Suddenly Fred became
aware that he was no longer tightly ﬁxed to the
‘tree. By _hours of soaking, equ1valent_to being
immersed in water, the ropethat held hlm to the
tree had becomelimn and relaxed. A thrill of
v ‘newly born hope ‘ﬁlled his mind, as he started to
take advantage of the fact. With hardly _any ex-
0 ertion he was able to extricate both of his arms,
but to free his body from the half a dozen coils
' was quite a different thing. Fortunately the boy

if; 7 had a stout knife in his pocket. He got it out, and

while holding on to the trunk with one arm sev-

ered all but one of his bonds in short order. Then

 he worked himself around the trunk till he got a

. footing on the earth behind, when he cut the last

tie -that held him a prisoner. ‘

.“Thank heaven!” he said. “I am free at last.

I shall yet cheat that scoundrel out of his re-
venge.» . , .

7 He staggered forward 'a few paces over the

/ sodden ground, then sank down exhausted beside

a ledge of rock that overhung the swollen stream.

How long he remained in that condition he never

‘ knew. The sun rose in a clear sky and warmed

« his wet and chilled body. At length he opened

\ j his eyes and drew a long breath. He found» that A

his gaze rested upon an opening in the rocks on
— a level with his face. The rays of the sun pene-
trating it glistened upon a heap of yellow coin
_ that was escaping from a fracture in a cedar
* chest. Fred looked at it in great wonder, hardly
 ’ , believinghis, eyes. Finally, spurred to action by
~ the glittering sight, he crawled up to the opening
" and looked in at close range. -
“Gold!” he ejaculated. “A. chest full of it.
And they look like English soverigns.” , ”
9/ .He thrust in his hand and drew out as many
’“ ‘coins‘ashe,cou'ld grasp. . ‘ e 0 ..  V
' All thought of his precarious position in the
V wilds vanished. He .was transported by the sight
of thegold. He spent an hour ﬁngering it and
- calculating the value of the contents of the box,
A which was /vsoheavy that he could not move it.
 Then the thought came to him, how could he get
 it away? This was a serious matter truly. If he
~ left it there would he be able to ﬁndthe spot
_ 7 again? Some one else might come that way and
j’ c » secure it.‘ The very idea made him feeldesperate
5.» ’ ~..a.t.the chance Bf losing this treasure which was
‘i now his.’ He got up and looked around.’ At that
moment the neigh of a horse struck on his ears.
A _ , “Some one is coming,” he breathed. “They
g. _/must not seethis gold or perhaps they will do
j, _ ’., me out of it. I must.'cover it up.”
_.~ ' He strained his ears, but heard no further
 sounds. ‘

_“Where did that neigh come from?” he asked?

r“  A himself.
’ Walking forward into the" glen he came in sight

of 'a‘-horse tied to a tree. It belonged to one of

1 the dead road agents, and had been abandoned to T

.sta1-ve up there in the wilds. -Fred hailed the

»} 1 animal with a shout of joy. He rushed up to it

most the ﬁrst person» he saw was Bud Baxter
with a bandage around his head. They, greeted . '
each other with great warmth, and Fred soon"  ‘
lated to Baxter and the assembled miners: ‘ﬂap’ "j

the road agents, the fate Redlawhad consigned,’ v.
him-to, and how he had escaped it. Then privately‘ ' '-

The vessel rocked violently for a few moments~ ~ I
