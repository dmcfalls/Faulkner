_ :. CHAPTER I.-—Stanley Hope, Messenger.

 *~Six _a.lei't-looking lads. from fourteen to eigh-
teen years of age, sat on_a lone bench ‘against
’ = . the,wall of an American District Telegraph Com-
ﬁf. pany’s branch office on Twenty-third street. New
York. one bright day early in the SI_)l'l.IlR. They
were all attired in the reirulation umform so_f_a-
miliar to the general public since the establish-
meat of this branch of the messenger service.

b Each boy had a number on his cap, and by that
7 number was he addressed by the manager of
t the oﬂice during business hours whenever his
‘ services were called into requisition.

They were a cheerful lot. those particular six
i boys, and they seemed to enjoy their strenuous.
calling. At any rate. they were quick on their
1eet,,'and were so bright and clever that they
never—or. at least. very seldoni—made a mis-
take in delivering a message. a package. a
bouquet, or- anything. in fact. intrusted to them.
Themanagerofthe oﬁicetookairood deal of
wide in those six boys. -He often said that there
were not six boys like them in any other oﬁice of
ﬂie A. D. '1‘. service. He had money to bet on it-
Thia was equivalent to a ch_a1lenze_to the manager

the popular leader among the six, and what any
one of the others would not do for him if called
upon was not worth mentioning. Stanley Hope
had the reputation of being the most 2' tie-
manly boy in the service. Consequently h was
a treat favorite with the ladies who had fre-
quent occasion for the services of the Twenty-
tliird Street branch oﬁice.

He lived over somewhere on the East Side, in a
small and modest ﬁat,- with his widow mother
and crippled sister, two years vounger than him-

- self. Anybody who know the Hopes could easily

believe that they had seen better days. There ,
was an indeﬁnable air of reﬁnement about the
little widow. and her son and daughter. that the
direst poverty could not wipe out. It was the
mark of gentle birth. Some people.‘ when luck‘
has driven them to the wall, are forever apologiz-
ing for their situation in life. They try to make
you understand that they are not accustomed
to their present situation. That once upon‘ a
time they were ever so much better off.

The Hopes never made such bids for sympathy.

If their path in life had once been among roses . f

they never alluded to the fact. Oii the day in

question Stanley Hope sat in his accustomed seat . 

at thehead of the bench. and his ﬁve associates »
ﬁlled the balance of the space. - " 

“Say, fellows.” spoke up Dick Diamond. “when - -
did this happen before 1"’ ’ 3.

“When did what happen before?” inquired Bob =
Blodgett. looking at the other.

“That we six were all together on this bench

anyway ?" _

“What should happen, except that use of us
will get a call in a moment. and then there’!
only be five left." said Bob. with a Iain. _ y _

“Where’s your nickel?”

“Here it is,” replied Willie, ﬁshing it out of
his pocket. ‘ .

“Is that the last tip you got?” asked Judson.
jeeringly. .

, “No. it isn't the last tip I got. Smarty. I’ll bet

I get more tips than you do.”

“One bet at a time, Willie. Here’s a nickelto

Judson.

’ Sprague, holding out his hand.
“Nixy,” objected Judson. “I'll hold the stakes

myself, because I'm going to win."

“You'll hold nothing,” said Walker. “Let Sam
hold ’:he”nickels." ‘

While Willie and Joe were bickering over their
bet at the end of the bench. Stanley Hope sat
‘silent and abstracted at the head of it. with a
far-away look in his ﬁne eyes.

“What are you thinking about, Stanley '."’ asked
Dick Diamond.

something out of the dollar bill as well. for when
the time was reckoned up after he returned to the
office, the change, if any, was always hanied
over to the messenger. This was a premium for
extra quick delivery of letters, packages, etc..

Building, boarding a car at the corner of Twenty-
fourth Street. He left the car halfway between
'l‘wenty-ninth Street and Fortieth and started up
the sidewalk. .

As he approached the entrance to the offices
in the Empire Theater Building a cab drew up
beside the curb. As a smoothly shaven elderly
man alighted. a long-haired, shabby-looking in-
dividual rushed upon him with unlifted cane from
the shadows of _a nearby doorway. Quick as a
wink. Stanley sprang forward and seized both

Stanley looked in the direction indicated and
saw several colored lithographs of “Old Mis-

never earned money easier in his life. :.

On Monday evening Stanley took Bob Blodgete
to see “Old Missouri.” and they both enjoyed the"

the dark side of the profession.

“Professional or not. I don’t like to see a man.
or a woman, either. go hungry."

7 The two boys hailed a car and were carried
downtown. When Miss Sanderson arrived at the
omce next lnorning Stanlev started in to tell her
how much he and his friend Bob Blodgett en-
toyed the show the night before.

“I a not surprised." replied the young lady.

along them Stanley saw piles of ﬁnished scenery
stored. They passed a couple,of men, one of
whom was working a pump-handle attached to a

other held the nozzle of a hose in his hand, with
which" he was spraying a recently painted “set-
piece.

“They’re ﬁreprooﬁng the scenery," replied the
boy. carelessly.

From the end of the driveway they entered
upon which appeared to Stanley as a fully ap-
pointed stage, though it was not elevated like
the stage of the ordinary theater. However. it
was every bit as complete in other ways. for
it had its full equipment of fly galleries, a loft.
and portable switchboard for electric lighting.
After leaging the stage they climbed two ﬂights
of stairs up through the fly galleries and into
a storeroom. and thence up another ﬂight into
the studio, where Mr. Taylor was found. Stanley
delivered the letter to him. ;_ 0

“Mr. Bloodgood sent you, eh ?” said the scenic
artist. -‘y

“I’m fromlllr. B1oodgood’s oﬂice.” replied the
boy. politely. _ , \ .‘ '

While Mr. Taylor was reading the letter, Stan-
ley looked around the room and saw hundreds
of photographs of different plays mounted in
frames standing around. The carpenter lad re-
mained in the background. prepared to pilot the
visitor back the way he had brought him. There
were other rooms and interesting sights in the
building that Stanley did not get the opportunity
to see. Neither did he get a glimpse of the
paint frames. where several artists were paint-
ing'a large dromsuspended some forty feet in
the air by the thinnest of steel cable. '

Mr. Taylor scribbled a reply on the back of
the letter, put it back in the envelope. and handed -i
it to Stanley with a nod of dismissal. Then the
two boys started to return to the ground floor.
On their way down one of the ﬂights through the
ﬂy galleries they overtook an attache of the

was skipping down the stairs rather recklessly.

“Don't mind me. mamma; I'm all right.’ re-
plied the young lady. turning a.mischievous look
back at her mother. -

That glance was a fatal one. for the girl slipped
as she placed her foot on a‘ piece of rope lying
in her road. and she pitched head forward from
the stairs down toward ‘the stage, forty feet ._

Stanley bowed. and said he was delighted to
make Miss Price’s acquaintance, even under such
strenuous circumstances. He further said that he
would be pleased to call at her home if she
wished him to. »

“Of course I wish it.” Eva insisted. impulsively’;
“I really couldn't think of not seeing’ you again,
after what you have done for me. You really
must call soon.”

The two young people were evidently much
taken with each other. Miss Eva was not only _‘
strikingly pretty, but uncommonly chic’ and .,
vivacious. She talked to Stanley as if she had
known him for years. The boy thought she
was the most attractive girl by long odds that he ' 1;
had ever met. and secretly he was pleased that »
it had -been his good fortune to render her so‘ _
signal a favor. Eva and Stanley walked together .

in the direction of Broadway.

CHAPTER VI.-——Stanley Tells Eva Price About
His Play.

Mr. Bloodgood was in his private office. and
immediately received Eva Price and her mother
on their arrival. The first thing Eva had to
tell him was about her narrow escape from a
terrible death in the LeBrun Studio. The man»
agar was not only astonished to hear her storv.
but amazed to learn that the handsome and
clever little actress owed her life to his young
assistant, Stanley Hope. .

Mr. Bloodgood at once called Stanley into the
private ofﬁce and questioned him before the ladies

t as to his part in the aﬁair. ‘ .
“You are certainly a very plucky gStan-
ley," he said. ‘and I have no doubt t at iss
Price is very grateful to you for the service
you rendered her." , ~ »

“I am. indeed—more than I can ever express,”
cried Eva. impulsively. “I shall never forget
it as long as I live—never!" with a shudder. as
the remembrance of her peril came back to her
more strongly than ever. «

When mother and daughter were ready to leave
for their home they went out _bv the‘reoeption-
room in order to see Stanley and tell him that he
must call at their apartments some afternoal j
that week, as Mr. Bloodgood had promised to let ., "
him oﬂ for that purpose, and the boy promised" it
to do so. Of course, Mr. Bloodgood told Miss 
Sanderson about Stanley’s nervy and thrilling act ,3
when he called her inside to give her some 
dictation, and when she returned to the reception» 45':
room she regarded her young assistant with more .62’;
respect and admiration than ever. ‘ "

Miss Sanderson, decidedly. when he had ﬁnished.

‘You can't receive too much Draise for Your

_conduct."

. ' Stanley made no reply. and the young lady went
' to her machine and began to typewrite 8 00111318
of letters from her notebook When Stanley
returned from lunch he found a bright young
reporter waiting to interview him about the

‘ studio aﬂair. Before he had’-finished, another
reporter came in who represented a morning

 newspaper, and the boy had to go over the facts

 again. A third and fourth reporter dropped in

with the information they were in quest of. All
the later editions of the afternoon papers- had

While due credit was accorded Stanley, the

articles were all written around the popular fa-

thrilling episode as prominent as possible.‘ This
suited the boy immensely. as he was Just as

region behind the curtain. It was the ﬁrst time
either had ever been in that part of a theater.
and the boy found suﬁcient to. interest him
while waiting for Eva to appear from her dress-
ing-_room. which she did in a short time. accom-
pamed by her mother. ' '

Stanley introduced his mother to Eva and Mrs.
Price, and" then the actress invited them to take
supper with herself and her mother. Thev ac-
cepted the invitation. They went to a well-
known _Sixth Avenue restaurant. where Eva
rnonopolized Stanley, much to the ¥y’s satisfac-
tion.

Stanley and his mother left Eva and her
mother at the entrance to the Elgin apartment
house. on West Forty-fourth Street, and then
took a car home. After that Stanley saw a good
deal of the little actress. either at the oﬁice or
at her own home. and their friendship grew as
the days went by.

One afternoon that Stanley called to see her
he told her about the play he had written.

“Have you really written a play. Stanley?" she
exclaimed. in pleased surprise.

“Yes; but I suppose it doesn't amount to any-
thing. It is my ﬁrst attempt in that line."

f‘dYou must bring it up and let me read it." s
sai . '

“I will, if you wish me to; but I'm afraid it will
only make you laugh.”

“I wouldn't make fun of anything belonging to
you,” she protested. “What land of a play is it?”

“It’s a Western melodrama.” \

“That's the kind of play Mr. Bloodgood is hav-
ing written for me. I'm to be featured, you know,
in a kind of harum-scarum wild Western part
that will give me a chance to introduce several
specialties in the way of songs and dances."

“My play is something on the same order. It’s

called ‘Nugget Nell.f Nugget Nell is the leading
part—--a kuid of wild girl of the mines. She
does all sorts of thrilling stunts at critical mo-
merits. After seeing you as Fanfan at the
Lyric, I think it would just suit you if it was
constructed properly for the stage.”
_ “You interest me very much. Stanley. I am
in love with the title ‘Nugget Nell.’ It is quite
suggestive of the line of business that I’m to
have in the play that Mr. Bloodgood is having
written for me. Now. I want you to bring your
play here to-morrow. and you and I will go over
it together, and I’ll make suggestions where they
may be needed. and if I like your ideas and con-
struction better than Mr. Bloodgood’s play. there
is no telling but that I may be able to find some
excuse to turn the other down and insist of using
yours.”

“If you only could, Eva." said Stanley. eager-
ly. “I’d be tickled- to death to have you act in a
play of mine. I know it would be a success.”

“And it would please me very much to do so.
In fact, I may say I'd rather play in one ‘of your
dramas than any one else’s.”

Stanley went home that afternoon feeling that
a new future was opening before him. ‘

kept it hidden in one of the pockets of his over-

the day, and he made a bee-line for the Elgin
apartment house. where Eva and her mother
lived. 'l'he_lifle beauty was expecting him.

“Did you.brmg your play ?" she asked eagerly.

“Sure I did,” replied Stanley. “Isn't that why

“Then we'll start in and read it together. I'm

his ﬁne curly head.

“I think it is time we looked at your play." said
-Eva, with a sweeping glance at the. handsome
boy from under her long eyelashes.

It was one of those kind of glances that are
always irresistible with man or boy, and it
thrilled Stanley from. his head to his foot. We
are bound to-say that Eva was a past master in
the art of feminine fascination. and she evidently
meant to win the boy for her own special self.

and began to read. Eva laying her clasped hands

CHAPTER VIII.—Miss Price's Unsatisfactory
i Interview with Her Manager.

“_This is the play for me." the little actress ex-
claimed, with enthusiasm. “Mr. Bloodgood must ‘
see it. I’m going to play ‘Nugget Nell.’ or I'll
throw up my contract." \

“Hold on. Eva. You forget that Mr. Bloodgood ‘,4
has made a contract with Mr. Bacon. the well— ,
known playwright. to write the play in which
you are to star. He has paid him ﬁve hundred
dollars down to bind the ‘contract. and Mr. Bacon
is’ to receive ﬁve hundred dollars for each 9f the

four acts as he submits them and they are ap-
proved.”
“I don't care,” retorted the little actress. ‘I'll

refund Mr. Bloodgood the five hundred dollars
and tell him to call the deal off. I shall speak to
him to-morrow about it."

“I'm afraid he won't listen to you. In the con-
tract you made with him he is to supnly the play.
and you are simply engaged to create the prin-
cipal part._ You are to be featured as the star
at a stated sum per week.”

“Yes. and if the play is a frost the company s

said Eva, sareasticaliy. “Well, I'm going to kick

Just suit my talents; but as ‘Golden Gulch’ seem:
to be the play I'll have to star in. why. I must,
give up all idea of appearing in ‘Nugget Nell’
for the present. -‘

"That's the way I look at it.” said Stanley.
regretfully.

“But I intend to play in it yet, Stanley," said
the little actress, with a decided nod of her golden
head. “So I want you to rewrite it for me in ac-
cordance with my suggestions."

“I’ll do that,” replied Stanley, eagerly.

She brought out his manuscript and together
they went over it. and she pointed out the
changes she wanted, and which she said would i
make it_go better. She also indicated where a lot .
of dialogue could be materially reduced without
hurting the scene. When the boy took up his hat
to 2'0 she said:

“Now, Stanley, 1 want
with me next season.”

“I’d like to." he replied wistfully, “but I don't
see how I can."

“Why not‘! Mr. Bloodgood will have to provide
a new executive stall‘ with the ‘Golden Gulch’
company.- Now, you ask him to let you go out in -
Some ¢3Dacit.V. as you are anxious to learn the ~*
practical side of the show business.”

“He told me that he intended to send-me out _
some time with one of his companies, but I guess
he meant after a year or so.”

“Never mind what you think he meant; just
strike him for a position with ‘Golden Gulch.’
and I will put in a good word for you. too." » _.-

‘Will you 2"

“I will. and he'll be willing to oblige me that
much. I. guess. If he objects there’ll be some- - ‘
thing doing.’ she said spiritedly. _ . .

“What a little ﬁghter you are. Eva.” laughed , 3
Stanley. “Dont you know that it won't do the ‘e-~
least bit of good to have another run-in with Mr.
aloodgood. If he wants me in New York I'll have

stay here. However, he owes me a favor for -
saving his head from getting broken. and perhaps '
he'll agree to let me go out with the company
which you will head." '

“How did you save Mr. Bloodgood from getting  -.
a broken head?" asked the girl. who had not 7
heard about the incident. ~-' ~
. Stanley told her of the attack made upon the
manager by Talbot 'l‘orrens. the heavy man. and
how he happened to be on the scene in time to
save Mr. Bloodgood. V 1
»-“If it hadn't been for ,that affair I dill would
be an A. D. '1‘. messenger. and should not have the
pleasure of knowing you.‘ he concluded. .
“And I would probably be dead and buried now, 7 _
for you wouldn't have been at the LeBm studio
